This is a speaker that can get loud and not distort at higher volume; be light enough to carry on a camping trip but remain durable enough to tumble in a bag unprotected. '''
  text1='''With 15–20 hours of battery and an IPX7 waterproof rating (not dust-proof, but I immersed it in water and it's fine), it's a great companion for some backyard tunes, a trip down the river, or a ton of other informal gatherings. If you don't need the extra bass and want an even tinier 7-inch speaker, the XSound Go ($33) is similar and also puts out clean audio for its size.'''
  text2='''The Ultimate Ears Wonderboom was a WIRED Gear of the Year award winner, and that's because it's the best pool companion you can have, and the new Wonderboom 2 is just a little better. The 4-inch(-ish) little ball of joy now sports IP67 water and dust resistance. It gets 13 hours of battery (three more than before), has a 100-foot Bluetooth range, floats, and pumps out surprisingly potent audio while doing it. UE says it's "drop-proof" up to 5 feet, but you can honestly play some light catch with it on the lawn and it won't be any worse for wear. Just wash it off when you're done! You can even pair two together for proper stereo sound.'''
  text5='''The exterior has a durable-feeling, splash-resistant silicone finish, and the front and back are covered with a steel grille. It has a front-facing woofer and a tweeter on each side, powered by a battery that lasts around 20 hours (USB-C charging with a 3.5-mm jack too), depending on how much you tweak the stylish volume, treble, and bass knobs up top. The battery indicator is also handy. I've enjoyed toting all 3 pounds of it around with its carry strap, which has a leather feel on the outside and a red velvet look and feel on the inside.'''
  text6='''The small size is truly impressive as is the surprisingly nice look and feel of the speaker. It is heavier than similar no name speakers and you almost have to wonder how they can sell it for such a low price. It comes with a micro USB charging cable and also a mini audio cable. The power switch is easily reached near the top of the back of the speaker where the audio input and charging port are also located behind a rubber flap. The rest of the controls are on the right side of the wedge.'''
  text6='''The most important thing you probably want to know is how does it sound. I’m sorry to say that with almost 20,000 review written already, many of them high energy endorsements, I’m not as impressed. I have definitely heard better from similar sized, and even smaller, speakers. It’s not bad, but it’s not knock your socks off impressive. And it’s definitely not a speaker that you would choose if there were more than one or two listeners or for use outdoors.'''
