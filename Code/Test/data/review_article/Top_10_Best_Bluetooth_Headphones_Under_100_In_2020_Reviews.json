The first entry on our list\nof the best Bluetooth headphones for under 100 dollars comes from Sennheiser.\n\nCan you really get good headphones for under $100?\n\nThe HD 4.40 are right at the top of this price range, but they will feel much\nmore expensive. The design covers the ear, rather than sitting inside like\nearbuds. This provides a better reduction of background noises.\n\nHow long do the batteries last?\n\nThe ear cup mounted controls allow you to easily change tracks and accept\nincoming calls. With up to 25 hours of play from a single battery charge,\nyou\u2019ll have cable free enjoyment all day. This comes together to make a great\nset of headphones for flights, trains, etc.\n\nThe best Travel Bluetooth headphones under $100\u2026\n\nYou won\u2019t get top notch sound quality from the less expensive options listed\nhere. However, these headphones use aptX technologies for surprisingly good\nwireless audio quality. The HD 4.40 are also compatible with the majority of\nsmartphones and tablets.\n\n[ ![Sennheiser HD 4.40 Around Ear Bluetooth\nHeadphones](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Sennheiser\nHD 4.40 Around Ear Bluetooth Headphones](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/616zfAHAGHL._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSZSJE9/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.2 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.2\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.2) (4.2 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSZSJE9/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __aptX Bluetooth codec.\n  *  __Full ear coverage for reduced ambient noise.\n  *  __Collapsible design for easy transportation.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __On the heavy side.\n  *  __Not the clearest audio playback.\n\n### `2` Anker Soundcore Liberty Air True-Wireless Earphones\n\nThe second option on our list of the best Bluetooth headphones under bucks\ncomes from Anker Soundcore. Their Liberty Air wireless earphones sit inside\nthe ear rather than cover it like our last product review. This offers more\ncomfort for some and creates a lighter and freer feeling.\n\nAre these the best Bluetooth earphones under $100?\n\nUsing pioneering audio technology, these earphones provide highly accurate\naudio with wonderful clarity. The noise cancelling microphones help reduce\nbackground noise. You get both ends of the conversation from both earpieces,\nwith listen and talk from both.\n\nWill the battery last all day?\n\nThe enhanced sound and noise cancelling microphones will last for up to five\nhours of music. With the charging case, you can extend that to a total of 20\nhours of playtime. You can even play, pause, and skip music or answer calls\nwith the integrated touch control.\n\nNo wires = more freedom.\n\nWith these wireless earphones, you\u2019ll not only get quality sound for less than\na hundred dollars. You also get the complete freedom of movement. There isn\u2019t\neven a connecting wire between the earphones, and you\u2019re completely free.\n\n[ ![Anker Soundcore Liberty Air True-Wireless\nEarphones](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Anker\nSoundcore Liberty Air True-Wireless Earphones](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/61WMj2oNkpL._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PLGZ4CR/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.2 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.2\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.2) (4.2 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PLGZ4CR/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __Bluetooth 5.0 technology.\n  *  __FPC antenna for a solid connection with skip-free music.\n  *  __Ergonomic in-ear design.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __No volume control offered on the earbuds.\n\n### `3` JLab Audio JBuds Air True Wireless Signature Bluetooth Earbuds\n\nOne of the least expensive options on our list of product reviews are produced\nby JLab Audio. The JBuds are another truly wireless set of earphones. With\nthese, you get a lot of bang for the buck; in fact, they\u2019re a lot better than\nyou\u2019d expect for such a low price point.\n\nDo they provide a quality listening experience?\n\nDesigned with custom EQ3 sound that puts you in control of the sound. No need\nfor an app to adjust the balance or boost the bass. The quick auto-connect of\nthe JBuds reduces a step and gets you listening as soon as they are taken from\nthe charging case.\n\nAre these the best Gym Bluetooth headphones under 100 dollars?\n\nThe IP55 sweat resistance rating will keep you exercising longer without\nworrying about damage to the earbuds. With over 6 hours of play per charge,\nand up to 18 extra hours of charge from the case, there will be no reason to\nstop pushing yourself.\n\nVolume control without touching your smartphone or tablet\u2026\n\nThe built-in microphone can activate Siri, Google Assistant, etc. And you can\nalso accept calls and keep on the move. The music and volume controls are also\naccessible via a push or two on the outside of the earbuds.\n\n[ ![JLab Audio JBuds Air True Wireless Signature Bluetooth\nEarbuds](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![JLab\nAudio JBuds Air True Wireless Signature Bluetooth Earbuds](https://images-\nna.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/71VmhqrcizL._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HGL3J31/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4) (4 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HGL3J31/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __Custom EQ3 sound.\n  *  __Over 6 hours of play per charge.\n  *  __IP55 water resistant.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __Limited sound quality you\u2019d expect from such a low price point.\n  *  __Some users have reported the sound cutting in and out.\n\n### `4` Letscom Bluetooth Headphones\n\nMarking the cheapest item on our list, Letscom produces a set of Bluetooth\nheadphones at a super low cost. Great for those looking for something truly\ncheap. These may not offer the best sound quality, but they do have some\nfeatures.\n\nIs it true that you get what you pay for?\n\nThese headphones offer 15 hours of playtime. That is considerably longer than\nwhat we expected at this price point. The Bluetooth technology brings a fast\nand stable connection.\n\nWe like the ear-wrap design that will keep these in-ear headphones from\nfalling out when you\u2019re moving about. This feature alone makes these the best\nrunning Bluetooth headphones under $100. Additionally, these earphones come\nwith an IPX7 waterproof design, so you won\u2019t need to worry about sweat.\n\nIs the sound quality limited by the low price?\n\nThe 11mm copper speakers are engineered with an enhanced bass and next to no\ndistortion. Using the latest RCV technology, these earphones ensure clear\nphone calls and passive noise cancellation. We feel the audio quality is\npretty good for the cost, though they simply do not hold up to some nicer\noptions reviewed here.\n\nWe will note that while we did not experience any issues, we expect that these\nheadphones will not last very long. The materials and overall feel of the\nearbuds doesn\u2019t suggest a long life. Be gentle with them, and you\u2019ll likely\nstill get your money\u2019s worth.\n\n[ ![Letscom Bluetooth\nHeadphones](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Letscom\nBluetooth Headphones](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/61E4B-6wybL._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W8NDBPS/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.5 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.5\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.5) (4.5 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W8NDBPS/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __IPX7 waterproof rating.\n  *  __Passive noise cancellation technology.\n  *  __Ergonomic ear-wrap design for comfort and stability.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __Utilizes Micro-USB cord charging.\n  *  __Low build quality.\n\n### `5` Jabra Move Wireless Bluetooth Headphones\n\nMoving back up to the top of the scale in price, we have the Move headphones\nfrom Jabra. These are another example of the over the ear style of headphones.\nHere your whole ear is covered, rather than an earbud that sits inside the ear\ncanal.\n\nTrue depth and clarity for your music and calls\u2026\n\nUtilizing Jabra\u2019s signature Digital Signal Processing these headphones bring\nexcellent audio quality to your music, movies, and calls. The Bluetooth\nlatency isn\u2019t top of the line with the SBC audio codec. Still, we think these\nheadphones provide sound quality nearing a level of higher end models\navailable at a much higher cost.\n\nBuilt to last for all day listening\u2026\n\nDesigned in Scandinavia, these headphones are built to last. You\u2019ll get a full\nday of music from the battery, with up to 14 hours of playback on a single\ncharge. The call and music buttons allow for complete control on the go, which\nwe also really appreciate.\n\nWireless freedom\u2026\n\nWhile these headphones are completely wireless, you aren\u2019t limited to a single\ncharge. If you forget to charge beforehand, you can attach the 3.5mm cable and\nkeep going.\n\n[ ![Jabra Move Wireless Bluetooth\nHeadphones](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Jabra\nMove Wireless Bluetooth Headphones](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/81047Q7BNQL._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MBGDZ1C/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.2 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.2\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.2) (4.2 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MBGDZ1C/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __Up to 14 hours of playback on a single charge.\n  *  __Digital Signal Processing audio quality.\n  *  __Lightweight design.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __Not the best Bluetooth audio codec.\n\n### `6` Marshall Major III Bluetooth Wireless On-Ear Headphones\n\nThe Major III by the brand Marshall provides another great option in the range\nof the top Bluetooth headphones for under $100. Once again designed with an\nover the ear fit, these headphones offer comfort surpassing what you would\nexpect at this price.\n\nCollapsible design for convenience when traveling\u2026\n\nGreat for those constantly on the move, these headphones utilize Bluetooth\naptX for outstanding audio quality. This provides freedom of movement far\nbeyond many other options, with up to 30 feet of listening range. Not only\nthat, but they supply 30+ hours of playtime on a single charge.\n\nHow\u2019s the sound quality?\n\nThe Major III brings you iconic sound through the 40 mm dynamic drivers. These\nare tuned for an enhanced bass, clear highs, and smooth mids. There is also a\nplay, pause, shuffle, and volume control provided by the multi-directional\ncontrol knob. You can even answer or decline calls wirelessly.\n\n[ ![Marshall Major III Bluetooth Wireless On-Ear\nHeadphones](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Marshall\nMajor III Bluetooth Wireless On-Ear Headphones](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/7118TJAtRXL._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CDZD8B7/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.4 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.4\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.4) (4.4 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CDZD8B7/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __Bluetooth aptX provides top connection quality.\n  *  __40 mm dynamic drivers for pristine audio quality.\n  *  __Collapsible design for convenience.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __Not the best noise cancelling technology compared to others.\n\n### `7` Anker Soundcore Life Q20\n\nA second option from the Anker brand\u2019s Soundcore division is the Life Q20.\nUnlike the product we reviewed above by the same brand, these headphones are\nof the on-ear design. They provide greater comfort for most, with less ear\ncanal irritation over extended periods.\n\nLong battery life for a more convenient life\u2026\n\nWith Hi-Res audio certified 40 mm dynamic drivers, these headphones produce\nexceptional sound quality. The active noise cancelling brings you music with\nhigh frequencies reaching up to 40 kHz for exceptional clarity and detail.\n\nReduce ambient sounds for a better experience\u2026\n\nIn fact, the noise cancelling technology reduces ambient sound by up to 90%.\nThe four built-in ANC microphones work in conjunction with the digital active\nnoise cancellation algorithm. This results in canceling out a wider range of\nlow and mid-frequency noises like cars. It\u2019s also great at reducing the rumble\nfrom airplane engines when flying.\n\nHow long does the battery last?\n\nThere is up to 40 hours of non-stop playback with the wireless active noise\ncancellation mode. This is then extended all the way to 60 hours in standard\nmusic mode. No matter where you are going, we think you\u2019ll have plenty of\nbattery life with these headphones.\n\nIn addition to all the above, the BassUp technology analyzes the low\nfrequencies in real-time to instantly adjust the bass output. When you have on\nbass-heavy genres like hip-hop or EDM, you can give the play button a double\ntap. This will provide an amplified listening experience.\n\n[ ![Anker Soundcore Life\nQ20](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Anker\nSoundcore Life Q20](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/61zQ40Pgf0L._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NM3RSRQ/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.3 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.3\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.3) (4.3 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NM3RSRQ/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __40 mm Hi-Res, dynamic drivers.\n  *  __Noise cancelling technology.\n  *  __Up to 60 hours of music playback.\n  *  __BassUp technology for deeper bass.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __Too large of a fit for some users.\n\n### `8` Skullcandy Grind Bluetooth Wireless On-Ear Headphones\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for some good Bluetooth headphones for under 100 dollars,\nour next entry might be just what you\u2019re after.

Still, for such a low price, you\nlikely be surprised how good they sound.\n\nAre they comfortable?\n\nBuilt to be worn all day, these headphones are built with premium materials.\nThe solid metal headband has soft on-ear pillows for your ears. These come\ntogether with the Supreme Sound audio for a very comfortable listening\nexperience.\n\nThe built-in controls allow you to play/pause music, answer/end calls, skip\ntracks, and adjust the volume as desired. All of this is accomplished with\nonly three buttons, making for a convenient listening experience.\n\n[ ![Skullcandy Grind Bluetooth Wireless On-Ear\nHeadphones](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Skullcandy\nGrind Bluetooth Wireless On-Ear Headphones](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/81Oj%2BYqZQBL._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BPF49RI/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.2 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.2\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.2) (4.2 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BPF49RI/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __Up to 12 hours of battery life.\n  *  __Supreme Sound quality.\n  *  __Comfortable on-ear fit.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __Not the best sound quality.\n\n### `9` JBL Live 400BT On-Ear Wireless Headphones\n\nJBL is an audio brand that has a reputation for producing top quality sound\nsystems. Their Live 400BT headphones may not be the top of the line, but they\nprovide a great option for those on a budget. Plus, they look sleek, without\ndrawing as much attention your way as our last product review.\n\nOne of the best Bluetooth headphones for under $100\u2026\n\nAs with a number of other options that we have reviewed above, these\nheadphones have 40 mm drivers. This helps to produce the superior sound that\nJBL is known for. The bass is punctuated and enhanced to make your music\nreally pop.  \n\nHey Alexa, what do you think?\n\nThese headphones can easily connect with Alexa or Google Assistant just by\ntapping the ear cup. Follow this with a text to a friend, selecting a favorite\nplaylist to listen to, or even check the weather \u2014 all without even looking at\nyour phone. We really like the convenience of this.\n\nHave a better conversation without removing your headphones\u2026\n\nEquipped with both Ambient Aware and TalkThru, you\u2019ll have better calls\nwithout needing to drop the headphones. Ambient Aware keeps you in touch with\nyour surroundings, which is wise when you\u2019re walking busy roads. TalkThru\nkeeps you moving while taking calls, with no need to disconnect the\nheadphones.\n\nAll of this comes with 24 hours of battery life, and a minimal 2-hour charging\ntime. Plus, the lightweight design and pillow-soft padded headband provide\nexcellent comfort. We also really like the multipoint connection capability\nthat lets you plug in and keep listening even if the battery dies.\n\n[ ![JBL Live 400BT On-Ear Wireless\nHeadphones](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![JBL\nLive 400BT On-Ear Wireless Headphones](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/61YED3Oqx1L._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MQ2V6NM/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.3 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.3\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.3) (4.3 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MQ2V6NM/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __24-hour battery life.\n  *  __Connects to Alexa and Google Assistant.\n  *  __Ambient Aware and talkThru technology.\n  *  __Plugged in listening option available if the battery dies.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __Smaller ear pads won\u2019t be comfortable for some.\n\n### `10` Soundcore Spirit X Wireless Sports Earphones\n\nThe last entry on our reviews of the best Bluetooth headphones for under $100\nis another in-ear design. The Spirit X by Soundcore sits in the ear canal and\nhas an over-the-ear wrap to help to keep them in place. These earphones are\ngreat for those looking for something to use at the gym or on runs.\n\nRun for miles without losing the earphones\u2026\n\nBuilt for sports, these headphones have an IP68 rated dust and waterproof\nprotection. You can go running in the rain or sweat till you drop without\ncausing an issue for the earphones. Plus, the FlexForm ear hooks help to keep\nthe earphones tightly in place no matter how extreme your workout becomes.\n\nHow is the battery life?\n\nYou\u2019ll get up to 18 hours of music playback from a single charge. This is\nachieved using a high-capacity battery to power the latest low-power\nconsumption chipset. This means that a 10-minute charge will provide up to 3\nhours of playback. Great for those who never remember to charge their devices\nfully in advance.\n\nDo they offer good sound quality?\n\nCompared to some others on this list, the sound quality leaves a bit to be\ndesired. The dynamic drivers are oversized, and the composite Bio-cellulose\ndiaphragm generates highly-detailed treble. Ultra-elastic materials then help\nincrease bass output, but overall we\u2019d say this is a step down from some\noptions.\n\n[ ![Soundcore Spirit X Wireless Sports\nEarphones](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Soundcore\nSpirit X Wireless Sports Earphones](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/619dePdZe0L._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W6N4HNP/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.4 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.4\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.4) (4.4 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W6N4HNP/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __IP68 dust and waterproof rating.\n  *  __Eighteen hours of battery life, with 3 hours available after only a 10-minute charge.\n  *  __Comfortable and stable design with ear-hook for a secure fit.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __\n\n## Best Bluetooth Headphones Under $100 Buying Guide\n\nNow that you have read through our list of product reviews, you should have a\nclear view of the various options available for under $100. Before you make a\npurchase, you need to determine which features are the most important to you.\nTo help you with this, we have covered a few things to consider before making\na decision.\n\n### Comfort Is Key If You Want To Listen For Hours On End\n\nThis may be the most important factor that affects your listening experience.\nIf you aren\u2019t comfortable, you\u2019re not likely to get sufficient use from the\nheadphones. But how do you know what to look for?\n\n![best bluetooth headphones under 100\nreviews](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![best\nbluetooth headphones under 100 reviews](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/best-bluetooth-headphones-under-100-reviews.png)\n\n### For Some, Penetration Is Key To Achieving Ultimate Results\u2026\n\nEarbuds that penetrate deeper into the ear canal offer a greater reduction in\nambient noise. However, earphones that sit deep within the ear canal can be\nless comfortable for some people. These can also become loose, even lost, when\nyou\u2019re moving around a great deal.\n\nFor this reason, some ears have ear hooks to help to keep them in place.\nStill, some will prefer the on-ear design. These headphones don\u2019t usually\noffer ambient noise reduction to the same extent as earbuds that sit within\nthe ear canal. You\u2019ll have to try both on-ear and in-ear designs to determine\nwhich is right for you.\n\n### Weight Also Affects Comfort\n\nObviously, the larger on-ear headphones are going to weigh a fair bit more\nthan the tiny in-ear options. Still, there can be a big difference in weight\nbetween many options that we reviewed above. Remember, too heavy or tight of a\nheadset will lead to earaches.\n\n### Are Wireless Headphones The Best?\n\nYes, as long as you get a decent pair that utilizes current Bluetooth\ntechnology. It\u2019s freeing not having a wire tie you to your device. However, if\nthe sound drops regularly, or there is constant crackling or the like due to\npoor wireless connection, the whole experience can be ruined.\n\n### You Can\u2019t Have Top End Audio Quality Without Top End Build Quality\n\nIt is true that you\u2019re not going to get top end build quality from super cheap\noptions out there. What you may not realize is that this means a reduction in\nsound quality. In addition to affecting the durability and longevity, the\nbuild quality can affect your listening experience with unwanted vibrations\nand sounds.\n\n### Everyone Wants The Best Sound Quality\n\nWhile it is true that you won\u2019t get the best audio quality at this price\npoint, modern technology has come a long way. Even for less than $100, you\nfind headphones these days that offer a great listening experience.\n\n![bluetooth headphones under 100\nreview](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![bluetooth\nheadphones under 100 review](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/bluetooth-headphones-under-100-review-893x1024.jpg)\n\n### It Can Be a Pain Pulling Your Phone Out To Answer Calls Or Skip Songs\n\nThere are a number of unique features out there like ear hooks, noise\ncancelling technology, and the choice of on-ear or in-ear designs for\npersonalized comfort.\n\nOne of these other features that we like the most is the presence of control\nbuttons on the headphones. This alleviates fumbling about to find your phone\nto skip annoying songs and roll the volume up when your favorite comes on.\n\n### Budget Considerations Can\u2019t Be Skipped\n\nWhile it would be great if we all could have the best in both sound quality\nand comfort in our earphones, some of us would rather not spend more than we\nneed to. There\u2019s plenty of decent options in the lower price ranges, though\nyou also need to consider durability as cheaper options tend not to last as\nlong.\n\n### Do You Prefer an On-ear or Earbud Design?\n\nSome people will very much prefer not having a small earbud shoved down into\ntheir ear canal. Others won\u2019t want the whole ear covered. This is especially\ntrue for many users that wear glasses, as the larger headphones can push on\nyour glasses, causing discomfort. You\u2019ll have to decide which option brings\nyou greater comfort.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIf none of these headphones have caught your eye, no need worry, there are\nmany other excellent options available. Just check out our in-depth reviews of\nthe [Best Wireless Bluetooth Headphones](https://oldtimemusic.com/best-\nwireless-bluetooth-headphones/), the [Best Waterproof Bluetooth\nHeadphones](https://oldtimemusic.com/best-waterproof-bluetooth-headphones/),\nthe [Most Comfortable Headphones](https://oldtimemusic.com/most-comfortable-\nheadphones/), the [Best Headphones under 100](https://oldtimemusic.com/best-\nheadphones-under-100/) dollars, the [Best Studio Headphones for Home\nRecording](https://oldtimemusic.com/best-studio-headphones-for-home-\nrecording/), and the [Best Headphones and Earbuds for\nSleeping](https://oldtimemusic.com/best-headphones-and-earbuds-for-sleeping/)\ncurrently available.\n\n## So, What Are The Best Bluetooth Headphones Under $100\n\nYou have now read through our product review list of the best Bluetooth\nheadphones under $100, and the buying guide.
