It's nothing to do with shortage of options; every online and physical\nmanufacturer from Apple to Ultimate Ears is vying for a bite of the Bluetooth\ncherry and, by association, your hard-earned cash. So, which model is most\nworthy of your precious coin? Fret not, we've rounded-up our pick of the best\nBluetooth speakers across all shapes, sizes and prices to ensure you discover\na product you'll be over the moon with.\n\nThe key thing here is to avoid opting for the first Bluetooth speaker that\ntakes your fancy. Yes, it might be a looker, but is it the best? It's really\nworth considering what you actually want from it. And since the two of you\nwill likely be together for quite some time, why not read our independent\nreview of the product \u2013 and maybe a few reviews of competing products in the\nprice category \u2013 first? You might discover a few features you didn't know you\ncould get for the money.\n\nWill your Bluetooth speaker be used purely at home? In that case you'll want\nsomething mains-powered. Do you want to be able to build a multi-room system\naround it? A smart Bluetooth speaker with with a built-in virtual assistant\nmight be something to consider. If you want more flexibility from your\nBluetooth speaker and the ability to chuck it in a bag and know that it'll\nfunction without issue later on, it sounds like a rugged, portable speaker\nwith a built-in rechargeable battery could be your best shot at long-term\ncompatibility and musical happiness.\n\nThe best Bluetooth speakers don't sacrifice on sound quality, either. Some\noffer impressive, room-filling, 360-degree sound while other models can be\nconnected together and used as a stereo pair in a more traditional\nconfiguration. Whether you're on a tight budget or have money to burn, there's\na model in this list that'll sort you out.\n\n![Best Bluetooth speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: JBL)\n\n### 1\\. JBL Flip 5\n\nNo frills and fantastic sound quality \u2013 this is the Best Bluetooth speaker for\nvalue.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Dimensions:** HxWxD (cm): 7.4 x 18.1 x 6.9 | **Power:** 20W | **Features:**\nBluetooth v4.2, PartyBoost for multiple connections to PartBoost enabled JBL\nspeakers, IPX7 rated | **Connections:** USB-C charger\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nSolid bass and timing\n\nGreat sense of acoustics\n\nPartyBoost stereo pairing\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nNo aux-in or microphone\n\nNot Connect+ compatible\n\nBasic app\n\nIf all you want is a portable Bluetooth speaker that sounds as good as you can\ncurrently buy for around \u00a3100 ($100, AU$119), you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to better\nthe fantastic Flip 5. JBL\u2019s newest offering sounds great for the price and is\nrugged enough to cope with a day at the pool.\n\nThe Flip 5 is waterproof to an IPX7 rating, boasts a 12 hour battery life and\nhas a USB-C charging port, meaning it goes from flat to fully juiced in just\n2.5 hours. It's a pleasure to use and scores highly for portability, with a\nwrist strap that slips comfortably over our hand. There's also a PartyBoost\nbutton that helps you pair two PartyBoost-enabled speakers to create a stereo\npair, or link over 100 PartyBoost-compatible speakers in mono.\n\nSound is impressively weighty and agile, with a good punch of bass and a real\nsense of openness and texture. Assuming you don't mind the lack of an aux-in\nport or inbuilt microphone (as seen in the [Flip\n4](https://www.whathifi.com/us/jbl/flip-4/review)), you'll almost certainly be\nwowed by this speaker's sonic chops. A superb performer.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **JBL Flip\n5**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/jbl-flip-5)\n\n![Best Bluetooth speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: JBL)\n\n### 2\\. JBL Charge 4\n\nA fun and bubbly Bluetooth speaker that's serious when it comes to sound.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Dimensions:** HxWxD (cm): 22 x 9.5 x 9.3 | **Power:** 30W | **Features:**\nwaterproof, Bluetooth v4.2, power bank, voice assistant integration |\n**Connections:** 3.5 mm stereo\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nRugged and water resistant\n\nUSB port for charging\n\nGreat sound quality\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nPerhaps too subtle for some\n\nThe fact that we really like the JBL Charge 4 should come as no surprise to\nthose who read our [Charge 3](https://www.whathifi.com/us/jbl/charge-3/review)\nreview. Not only is this one of sweetest-sounding Bluetooth speakers around at\nthis end of the market, it serves up a whopping 20 hours of playback from a\nsingle charge. Impressive.\n\nJBL has fine-tuned the sound in this latest iteration to please even pickier\nears. Obviously there's a limit to the bass floor in a speaker of this size,\nbut the low-end is tasteful \u2013 and there's plenty of punch.\n\nYou get a nice array of features for the money, too. The IPX7 water resistance\nmeans the Charge 4 can handle being submerged in water to a depth of 1.5m. And\nunlike the Flip 5 (above), you can also use the Charge 4 to juice up your\nphone \u2013 or any other device that will charge over USB from a 5V supply.\n\nThe Flip 5 (above) is cheaper and lighter, but the Charge 4's rugged design,\nexcellent battery life and \u2018battery sharing\u2019 make it a near-perfect speaker\nfor camping, beach trips and home use.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **JBL Charge\n4**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/jbl-charge-4)\n\n![Best Bluetooth speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Linn)\n\n### 3\\. Linn Series 3\n\nOne of the best wireless speakers we\u2019ve heard with a premium price tag.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Dimensions:** HxWxD (cm):25 x 29.6 x 20.6 | **Power:** : 2x100W |\n**Features:** Wireless integrated Linn DSM player, Exakt digital crossover |\n**Connections:** Ethernet, USB, HDMI ARC\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nWonderfully articulate\n\nLuxury design\n\nHDMI ARC for TV connection\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nNo analogue inputs\n\nNo Tidal Masters support\n\nLet's address the elephant in the room: the Series 3 is one of the most\nexpensive wireless speakers we have tested. It\u2019s over three times the price of\nthe [B&W Formation Wedge](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/bowers-and-\nwilkins-formation-wedge). Can such an outlay be justified? Well, yes.\n\nLinn\u2019s gorgeous design aesthetic and proprietary Exakt technology certainly\nhelps. Linn Exakt aims to reduce phase errors by intentionally delaying higher\nfrequencies so they arrive at your ear at the same time as lower frequencies.\nIt also keeps the music signal\u2019s data in the digital domain for as long as\npossible to avoid any degradation caused by signal processing. We\u2019ve heard\nExakt do its thing in many a Linn product before, and here again it\ncontributes to an absorbing performance packed with stunning midrange clarity\nand a level of insight that sets it apart from more affordable competitors.\n\nAs you'd expect, the Series 3 is packed with premium features and Linn\u2019s well\nestablished streaming platform, which offers access to networked servers and\nhigh-quality music services [Tidal](https://www.whathifi.com/us/tidal/review)\nand [Qobuz](https://www.whathifi.com/us/qobuz/review) via Linn's app. You even\nget an HDMI ARC socket, which allows you to connect the speaker to a TV.\n\nAt \u00a33000 ($3850, AU$5800), we can hardly describe the Series 3 as a bargain,\nbut we are utterly convinced of its appeal.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Linn Series\n3**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/linn-series-3-review) ****\n\n![Best Bluetooth speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n###  4\\. Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 2\n\nAn affordable Bluetooth speaker with a weighty sound and good battery life.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Connectivity:** Bluetooth | **Power:** Battery | **Battery life:** 13hrs |\n**Charge time:** 2.6hrs **Dimensions (hwd):** 10.4 x 9.5 x 9.5cm | **Weight:**\n420g\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nPunchy, entertaining sound\n\nHefty bass\n\nDecent battery life\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nNo wi-fi or smart assistant built-in\n\nNo mic for hands-free calls\n\nUltimate Ears has really made a splash in the Bluetooth speaker market with a\nnumber of colourful, fun-sounding and portable models. One its most biggest\nhits? The impressive Wonderboom 2.\n\nIt's waterproof, sandproof, dustproof and is also designed to float, so it\nshould withstand the most lively of pool parties. Battery life is 13 hours and\na full charge takes just under three.\n\nSonically, the Wonderboom 2 is an exciting listen. Bass is impressive bass\ngiven its small dimensions and there's plenty of detail and a fine sense of\nattack. You also get a \u2018boost\u2019 button on the underside of the unit. When\npressed, it restricts the bass frequencies, allowing the UE to play louder\nthrough the midrange, which in turn makes the sound easier to hear when the\nunit is used outdoors.\n\nThere's no built-in mic or app, but the Wonderboom 2 is easily one of the best\nsounding Bluetooth speakers you can buy for the money \u2013 and a What Hi-Fi? 2019\nAward-winner too, y'know.\n\n**Read the full review:**[ **Ultimate Ears Wonderboom\n2**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/ultimate-ears-wonderboom-2)\n\n![Best Bluetooth speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Dynaudio)\n\n### 5\\. Dynaudio Music 5\n\nA superb sonic performance from a distinctive speaker.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Connectivity:** Bluetooth and wi-fi | **Power:** 250W (mains powered) |\n**Inputs:** analogue audio jack, Toslink optical digital audio | **Battery\nlife:** N/A | **Dimensions (hwd): 20 x 66 x 18.5cm :** | **Weight:** 5.4kg\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nExpansive, weighty and accurate\n\nGreat for larger rooms\n\nTop-notch build\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nNo AirPlay 2\n\nNo Spotify Connect\n\nThe Dynaudio Music 5 is the second-largest one-box speaker in the company\u2019s\ninaugural, four-strong Music series. And love or loathe its angular looks, __\nwe can\u2019t help but be won over by how the Dynaudio Music 5 sounds.\n\nIt might be a powerful, but the Music 5 has the sonic nous to keeps things\nrefined. While the Award-winning\n[Naim](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/naim-mu-so-qb-2nd-generation)\n(below) just edges it for both subtlety and a slightly livelier sound, there\nisn't much in it \u2013 and the Dynaudio Music 5 boasts superiority in other ways.\nIn a larger room, it boasts better weight, scale and authority. Sound is\nsmooth, detail-rich, refined and resoundingly listenable.\n\nConnectivity is excellent, too, with aptX Bluetooth, wi-fi and AirPlay all\npresent. Open up the Dynaudio app and you'll discover NoiseAdapt, a feature\nthat helps sound cut through a noisy room \u2013 useful during loud parties.\n\nAssuming you love its distinctive styling, the Dynaudio Music 5 is a\nsophisticated performer and a superb buy.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Dynaudio Music\n5**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/dynaudio-music-5)\n\n![Best Bluetooth speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n###  6\\. Audio Pro Addon C3\n\nPortability, multi-room skills and excellent sound quality in an impressive\npackage.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Connectivity:** Bluetooth and wi-fi | **Power:** Battery | **Inputs:** 3.5mm\n| **Battery life:** 15hrs | **Dimensions (hwd):** 11.5 x 21.5 x 13.5cm |\n**Weight:** 2.45kg\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nMature, refined sound\n\nImpressive timing\n\nTight, textured bass\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nControl app could be slicker\n\nThe Audio Pro Addon C3 isn't just the best Bluetooth speaker at this price,\nit's a stylish, wi-fi connected, multi-room capable centrepiece \u2013 and a What\nHi-Fi? 2019 Award winner.\n\nSound is focused yet open and airy, meaning you can fill a decent sized room\nwith immersive, weighty sound. It has an fantastic sense of refinement for\nsuch a small speaker, not to mention a rear-firing bass reflex port that\ndelivers plenty of low-end grunt.\n\nThis model won't charge your smartphone but it does feature an ethernet port,\ngiving you the option to hardwire it to your home network. The battery serves\nup around 15 hours playback (less if you crank the volume up to the max).\n\nThe C3 supports streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Qobuz and Apple\nMusic, and while there's no built-in voice assistant, you can control the\nspeaker via the Alexa app.\n\nIf you're after something more rugged and portable, we'd suggest rivals such\nas the [Ultimate Ears Megaboom](https://www.whathifi.com/us/ultimate-\nears/megaboom/review) or[ JBL\nXtreme](https://www.whathifi.com/us/jbl/xtreme/review). But as a sensational-\nsounding multi-room proposition, this speaker gives Sonos a serious run for\nits money.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Audio Pro Addon\nC3**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/audio-pro/addon-c3/review)\n\n![Best Bluetooth speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Naim)\n\n### 7\\. Naim Mu-so Qb 2nd Generation\n\nJust a few tweaks make for a superb second version of this premium Bluetooth\nspeaker.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Dimensions:** HxWxD (cm): 21 x 22 x 21 | **Power:** : 300W | **Features:**\nApple AirPlay 2, Chromecast, Spotify Connect, Tidal, Roon Ready, Hi-res up to\n24-bit/384kHz, remote control | **Connections:** 3.5mm aux, USB, optical\nS/PDIF, Ethernet\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nOpen, detailed and expressive\n\nLoads of streaming options\n\nMulti-room ready\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nNothing at this price\n\nAt What Hi-Fi?, we know full well the value of revisions. Yet still, it was\nquite the surprise when first we heard about one made by Naim, with its second\ngeneration of the Mu-so Qb wireless speaker. The [previous\niteration](https://www.whathifi.com/us/naim/mu-so-qb/review) was great,\nearning five stars when it was first reviewed. This version, however, is even\nbetter.\n\nYou can now choose between an Olive, Terracotta or Peacock grille alongside\nthe standard black, but the best tweaks Naim has made go far deeper. Remove\nwhatever colour grille you've gone for and you'll be rewarded with upgraded\nand optimised midrange and bass drive units, all powered by a total of 300W of\namplification.\n\nYou won't be short of streaming options, thanks to [Chromecast Built-\nin](https://www.whathifi.com/us/advice/what-google-chromecast-which-speakers-\nand-tvs-are-supported) and [Apple AirPlay\n2](https://www.whathifi.com/us/advice/apple-airplay-2-everything-you-need-to-\nknow) alongside Bluetooth for streaming from a device, as well as [Spotify\nConnect](https://www.whathifi.com/us/spotify/review), Roon Ready, internet\nradio and [Tidal](https://www.whathifi.com/us/tidal/review). You\u2019ll also be\nable to access files up to 32-bit/384kHz anywhere on your home network via the\nupdated Naim app\n\nWith punchy bass and sparkling and rich tones across the frequencies, we had\nno hesitation in awarding the Mu-so Qb 2nd Generation our 2019 What Hi-Fi?\nAward for the best home wireless speaker over \u00a3500.\n\n**Read the full review:**[ **Naim Mu-so Qb 2nd\nGeneration**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/naim-mu-so-qb-2nd-\ngeneration) ****\n\n![Best portable speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n###  8\\. Amazon Echo Dot (3rd generation)\n\nOne of the best and cheapest ways to introduce Alexa to your home.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Dimensions:** HxWxD (cm): 4.3 x 9.9 x 9.9 | **Features:** wi-fi, multi-room,\nBluetooth V4.0, Alexa voice assistant, Spotify, TuneIn, Amazon Music |\n**Connections:** 3.5 mm stereo\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nClear, solid sound\n\nImproved Alexa capabilities\n\nBudget price\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nAlexa intelligence is limited\n\nAmazon's ever-expanding collection smart speakers dish up decent sound and a\nwhole load of voice functionality for not a lot of money. The Echo Dot is one\nof the cheapest in the range \u2013 and a great little portable device that's\nperfect for the kitchen or bedroom.\n\nThe fabric-covered puck features a 4cm driver that pumps out decent enough\nsound. Alexa sounds loud and clear and, for the money, music sounds rich and\nfull. It's perfectly acceptable as a background music device, plus you can\nalways wire in other devices via the 3.5mm aux output for better sound.\n\nYou need to connect the Echo Dot to power, so it's not as portable as some\noptions on this list. But on the upside, the Echo Dot can be used to play\nmusic, answer questions, read the news, check the weather, set alarms and\ncontrol compatible smart home devices, from TVs to home cinema amplifiers and\nspeakers.\n\nFor the money, it's one of the best cheap portable speakers around.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Amazon Echo Dot (3rd\ngeneration)**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-\ngeneration)\n\n![Best portable speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n###  9\\. Audio Pro Addon T3\n\nBigger than some rivals, but still portable enough to give serious\nconsideration.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Dimensions:** HxWxD (cm): 11.5 x 21.5 x 13.5 | **Power:** 2x 5W + 15W\nDigital class D | **Features:** Bluetooth V4.0 | **Connections:** 3.5mm\nstereo, USB\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nFull sound\n\nExpressive and dynamic\n\nFaultless build\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nSize won't suit everyone\n\nIt might be one of the less portable speakers in this list, but the T3 can\nstill be carted around thanks to the carry handle. It's robust rather than\nheavy, and boasts a battery life of up to 30 hours. Like bass? You're in luck\n- the solid chassis and rear-firing bass port will have you tapping your toe\nin no time.\n\nThere's no wi-fi (if you want wi-fi, opt of the Addon C3), but the Bluetooth-\nenabled T3 features a similarly classy design with textured surfaces and a\nleather embossed handle .\n\nAudio Pro tends to ignore gimmicks in favour of high-quality sound but this\nspeaker does have the facility to charge up your smartphone or tablets via a\nUSB port. You also get an auxiliary input for your TV/MP3 player/record\nplayer.\n\nSound is superb, with plenty of depth and detail throughout the frequencies.\nIf you want something for home and in the garden, this could work nicely \u2013\nmaybe not the one for your carry-on luggage, though.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ _ **Audio Pro Addon\nT3**_](https://www.whathifi.com/us/audio-pro/addon-t3/review)\n\n![Best Bluetooth speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n###  10\\. JBL Xtreme 2\n\nOne of the best Bluetooth speakers we've heard with bags of ability.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Connectivity:** Bluetooth | **Power:** Battery | **Inputs:** 3.5mm |\n**Battery life:** 15hrs | **Dimensions (hwd):** 13.6 x 28.8 x 13.2cm |\n**Weight:** 2.39kg\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nClean, clear sound\n\nBalanced bass\n\nRobust build\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nHefty design\n\nNo wi-fi or multi-room smarts\n\nThe JBL Xtreme 2's boombox design has fun and excitement written all over it.\nThe rugged, IPX7 waterproof exterior, 15 hour battery life and ability to\ncharge your phone from its USB port mean it's a great option for the beach.\n\nWireless features have been stripped-back, though. There's no wi-fi, so you\ncan't stream from Spotify. And it won\u2019t let you talk to Alexa or Google\nAssistant, just set a button to activate them in the manner of an earphone\u2019s\nin-line remote.\n\nJBL Connect+ is the most unusual feature on this otherwise standard Bluetooth\nspeaker. It lets you link up to 100 JBL speakers, to make the equivalent of a\nnightclub PA in your home.\n\nThere's plenty of boom to the sound, but we're not talking ridiculous levels.\nThat deep powerful bass is also nicely controlled too. Mids are of a high\nquality and highs show more clarity than you traditionally get from such a\nproduct. For the money, the JBL Xtreme 2 is brilliantly balanced Bluetooth\nspeaker.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **JBL Xtreme\n2**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/jbl-xtreme-2)\n\n![Best Bluetooth speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n###  11\\. Ultimate Ears Blast\n\nEnergetic performance, Alexa onboard and Wi-Fi connectivity.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Connectivity:** Bluetooth and wi-fi | **Power:** Battery | **Inputs:** N/A |\n**Battery life:** 12hrs | **Dimensions (hwd):** 118.8 x 6.8 x 6.8cm |\n**Weight:** 463g\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nGreat portable design\n\nExciting, dynamic sound\n\nGood detail and punchy timing\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nTop end can get excitable at loud volumes\n\nAlexa features not exhaustive\n\nUltimate Ears has a knack for making Bluetooth speakers that combine the right\ncombination of sound, design and rugged features, and it does so again with\nthe Blast. Its cylindrical 360-degree design means it throws sound evenly\naround the room, while the tough 'IP67 waterproof' exterior means it can can\nsurvive in 1m of water for 30 minutes.\n\nIt's crammed with connectivity, too. You get Bluetooth, wi-fi and Alexa smart\nassistant voice controls, meaning you can turn up the volume or play songs\nthrough Amazon Music Unlimited without lifting a finger. Far-field voice\nrecognition is excellent, and there's a nifty LED strip that glows and blinks\nwhen you interact with Alexa.\n\nThe lack of 3.5mm audio input might bother some, but we found the Blast to be\na real crowd-pleaser. The 360-degree sound and bass output is far better than\none might expect for this kind of money; throw in Alexa smarts and you have a\nfun, energetic speaker that offers plenty of bang for your buck.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **UE\nBlast**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/ultimate-ears/blast/review)\n\n![Best Bluetooth speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Amazon)\n\n### 12\\. Amazon Echo Show 5\n\nOne of the best Bluetooth speakers we've seen with a screen.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Dimensions (hwd):** 8.6 x 14.8 x 7.3cm | **Connectivity:** Wi-fi, USB, 3.5mm\nline-in | **Battery life:** n/a | **Power:** 4W\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nAlexa voice-control\n\nDecent sound and video\n\nNicely put together\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nAudio isn't the best\n\nThe Echo Show 5 is the latest in a long and fast-moving line of Amazon\nproducts intended to get us all invested in its virtual assistant, Alexa.\nWhere much of the Alexa-enabled kit out there is audio based, concentrated on\nthe Bluetooth speaker market in particular, the Echo Show 5 embraces both\nsound and video in its abilities to communicate. So, as well as playing music\nor reading out information, you can access video content on the 5.5in LCD\ntouchscreen. There's also a camera for video calls.\n\nThe Echo Show 5 is a diminutive device, and as such cannot possibly offer the\nscale of sound that some specialist wireless speakers can. But then it offers\nso much more ability and functionality than a run-of-the-mill Bluetooth\nspeaker. For what it is, we find the sound perfectly acceptable. It runs\nfairly warm, sonically, which helps voices on radio and the like, and makes\nfor a comfortable listening experience. There are better speakers out there\nbut this is much more than that. It opens up the world of the digital\nassistant to a whole new audience for both audio and video; and if that\u2019s what\nyou\u2019re after, this is about as good as you\u2019ll get.\n\n**Read the full review:**[ **Amazon Echo Show\n5**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/amazon-echo-show-5)\n\n![Best Bluetooth speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n###  13\\. Dali Katch\n\nThis Dali Bluetooth speaker ticks all our boxes.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Dimensions (hwd):** 13.8 x 26.9 x 4.7cm | **Connectivity:** aptX Bluetooth,\n3.5mm | **Battery life:** 24hr | **Power:** 50W\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nPowerful, full-bodied sound\n\nGreat dynamics and timing\n\nLong battery life\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nNothing at this price\n\nIf you're after a premium portable speaker, there's every chance that the Dali\nKatch will blow your cashmere socks off. Dali, better known for its\ntraditional hi-fi speakers, has managed to extract a sound that is quite\nsimply incredible for something of the Katch\u2019s stature.\n\nTwo tweeters and a pair of aluminium woofers, driven by a Class-D amplifier,\nmake for a total power output of 50W \u2013 not to mention an impressive amount of\ndetail and a nice dose of velvety low-end.\n\nThe speaker boasts buttons for power, volume and pairing, which is made easier\nwith the option of NFC. There are also two EQ presets: one for freestanding\nplay and one for positioning on a shelf. And let's not forget the excellent\nbattery life: just two hours of charge will get you around 24 hours of music\nplayback via Bluetooth.\n\nThe Katch isn't cheap, but you do get what you pay for \u2013 a weighty, dynamic\nsound that defies this speaker's dimensions.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Dali\nKatch**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/dali/katch/review)\n\n![Best Bluetooth speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n###  14\\. Ultimate Ears Megablast\n\nA lively, entertaining Bluetooth speaker with plenty going for it.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Connectivity:** Bluetooth and wi-fi | **Power:** Battery | **Inputs:** N/A |\n**Battery life:** 16hrs | **Dimensions (hwd):** 23.7 x 8.8 x 8.8cm |\n**Weight:** 1.19kg\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nDynamic, detailed sound\n\nEnthusiastic, punchy rhythms\n\nPrecise, taut basslines\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nPresentation is slightly lean\n\nNot fully featured just yet\n\nThe powerful UE Megablast takes the performance of a portable Bluetooth\nspeaker at this price to a new level. If you're looking for thumping bass,\nwell, let's just say you've come to the right place.\n\nDesign-wise, the Megablast is waterproof (IP67 rated), so it will survive\nbeing dunked in the pool or exposed to a sudden downpour. Battery life is 16\nhours, which is pretty respectable given that it has Alexa voice smarts built-\nin.\n\nSay the wake word \u2018Alexa\u2019 and a white LED strip on top of the Megablast glows\nin recognition. Features include voice-controlled music playback over wi-fi,\nthrough Amazon Music Unlimited and TuneIn radio, plus support for the likes of\n[Spotify](https://www.whathifi.com/us/spotify/review),\n[Deezer](https://www.whathifi.com/us/deezer/review) and [Amazon\nMusic](https://www.whathifi.com/us/amazon/prime-music/review). There's no\n3.5mm audio jack, though.\n\nA combination of pounding bass and enthusiastic sense of rhythm make for a\nhugely enjoyable performance. It might not be the most pocketable speaker\naround, but few rivals can match the Megablast for bass quality. An absolute\ntreat.\n\n**Read the full review:**[ **UE\nMegablast**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/ultimate-ears/megablast/review)\n\n![Best portable speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n###  15\\. JBL Go 2\n\nImpressive sound from an impressively small and portable package.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Dimensions:** HxWxD (cm): 7.1 x 8.6 x 3.2 | **Power:** 3W | **Features:**\nIPX7 waterproof, Bluetooth V4.1 | **Connections:** micro-USB | **Finishes:**\n12\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nTidy design\n\nBalanced sound\n\nDecent bass\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nBattery life could be better\n\nThe budget JBL Go 2 might be the perfect holiday accessory. It's a tiny\nspeaker, no bigger than a bar of soap, which makes it small enough to slip\ninto your pocket. There are 12 colours in the range, including the retro-\nfabulously pearlescent yellow model pictured above.\n\nThe Go 2 has a full waterproof IPX7 rating, so it won't matter if you drop it\nin the pool by mistake. Features are thin on the ground, but you go get an aux\ninput, plus a noise-cancelling speakerphone and built-in mic for handsfree\ncalls. There's no wi-fi, though, and the battery life is a little\ndisappointing: 2.5 hours of charging returns a maximum playing time of just\nfive hours.\n\nDespite an output of just 3W, the Go 2 punches above its weight when it comes\nto sound. For the money, it's a lively, balanced and cohesive performer. If\nyou're the sort of person who likes to travel light, we think this is up there\nwith the best Bluetooth speakers of its type.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **JBL Go\n2**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/jbl-go-2)\n\n![Best portable speakers\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n###  16\\. Bose SoundLink Mini II\n\nThis Bose portable speaker is a decent option for the money.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Dimensions:** HxWxD (cm): 5.1 x 18 x 5.8 | **Features:** Bluetooth V3.0 |\n**Connections:** 3.5mm stereo, micro-USB\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nFull-bodied sound\n\nWeighty bass\n\nPortable\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nLows lack precision and agility\n\nIf you\u2019re after a portable speaker that doesn't scrimp on bass weight, the\nSoundLink Mini II could be just the ticket. The small but hefty design pumps\nout a big, bassy sound that will get you dancing by the pool.\n\nBose has kept features to a bare minimum; there are buttons for power, pairing\n(you can link two devices at a time and switch between them) and volume. You\nalso get an aux input and a USB input for charging. Battery life is 10 hours \u2013\npretty good for a speaker of this size.\n\nThe big attraction here is the sound quality. While lots of portable speakers\noffer fuller bass, it's often boomy or distorted. That's certainly not the\ncase with the SoundLink Mini II, which sounds taut and expressive. Vocals are\nexceedingly rich and instruments are given space to breathe. In fact, the\nsound is as good as anything we've heard at this price and stature. Other\nspeakers are better value for money, but this high-quality Bose speaker is\nstill a fantastic buy.\n\n**Read the full review:**[ **Bose SoundLink Mini\nII**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/bose/soundlink-mini-ii/review)\n\n  * [ **Best waterproof speakers**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/best-buys/best-waterproof-speakers-around-right-now-budget-portable-smart)\n  * [ _ **Best computer speakers**_](https://www.whathifi.com/us/best-buys/best-desktop-computer-speakers)\n  * [ _ **Best wireless speakers**_](https://www.whathifi.com/us/best-buys/best-wireless-speakers-wonderful-wi-fi-speakers-for-all-budgets)\n  * [ _ **Sony XB Bluetooth speakers: should you buy one?**_](https://www.whathifi.com/us/advice/sony-bluetooth-speakers-should-you-buy-one-what-are-the-best-deals)\n\n__ See all comments (1)\n\n1 Comment [ Comment from the forums\n](https://forums.whathifi.com/threads/best-bluetooth-speakers-portable-\nspeakers-for-every-budget.111291/)\n\n  * atkins14 12 June 2020 13:50\n\nWhat is actually the best sounding speaker though?
