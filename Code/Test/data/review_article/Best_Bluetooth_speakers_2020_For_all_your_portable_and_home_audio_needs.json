Whether you\u2019re looking for something tough and durable that you\ncan beat up and throw around or something that will just sound great, you\ncan\u2019t go wrong with anything on this list.\n\n_Editor\u2019s note: this list of the best Bluetooth speakers was updated on July\n10, 2020, to replace the Marshall Stanmore with the Marshall Stanmore II, and\nto add the Marshall Stanmore II Voice to the notable mentions section._\n\n## If you want the best, go with the JBL Charge 4\n\nWhether you\u2019re having a pool party or going camping, the best all-around\nspeaker you want by your side is the[ JBL Charge\n4](https://www.soundguys.com/jbl-charge-4-review-20927/). Initially, we had\nthe [JBL Charge 3](https://www.soundguys.com/jbl-charge-3-review-9360/) in\nthis top spot, even after the newer model was released. The reason for this\nwas because the upgrades between the Charge 3 and the newer Charge 4 are\nminimal, and the cost difference just wasn\u2019t justifiable. That said, it\u2019s now\nbeen a while since the release of the Charge 4 and its dropped in price to\nroughly the same as the older Charge 3. In that case, why spend the same money\nfor an older product?\n\n## JBL Charge 4\n\n[Full Review](https://www.soundguys.com/jbl-charge-4-review-20927/)\n\nBest All-Around\n\n![](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/JBL-\nCharge-4-10-1024x576.jpg)\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\nJBL Charge 4\n\n8.7\n\n[](https://geni.us/grSjtSU)\n\nOf course, some of the best features of the Charge 4 aren\u2019t exclusive to it.\nBoth the[ JBL Xtreme](https://www.soundguys.com/jbl-xtreme-review-6902/) and\n[JBL Flip 4](https://www.soundguys.com/jbl-flip-4-review-13036/) also share\nthese features, but the Charge 4 hits the sweet spot. You get some of that\nlarge sound that the Xtreme offers with some of the portability of the Flip 4.\nIt makes all the right compromises, including battery life. You\u2019ll get about\n20 hours as well as the option to charge some of your other devices, thanks to\na USB-A output (hence the name). As far as sound quality goes, the only area\nthat isn\u2019t great is the mids, these tend to take a backseat to the bass in\nsmall to medium-sized rooms.\n\nHowever, a word of caution: the JBL Flip 5 does not support the multi-speaker\nlinking standard of the older JBL speakers, and it only has one channel. We\nrecommend sticking with the Flip 3 or Flip 4 instead\u2014they get the job done and\nyou\u2019ll spend less money to get them.\n\n## What you should know\n\n### Pay attention to Bluetooth codecs\n\n[![SBC aptX aptX HD AAC LDAC bluetooth codecs profile\naudio](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/BT-Codecs-\nkbps_LK-2-1024x663.jpg)](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/12/BT-Codecs-kbps_LK-2.jpg)\n\nRepresented is the max transfer rate (kbps) of each respective Bluetooth codec\n(greater is better). Each waveform depicts a transfer rate of 100 kbps.\n\nJust like [wireless headphones](https://www.soundguys.com/best-bluetooth-\nheadphones-2016-2595/), Bluetooth speakers support specific [Bluetooth\ncodecs](https://www.soundguys.com/understanding-bluetooth-codecs-15352/). For\nthose unfamiliar with the concept, a codec determines how a file is\ntransmitted from a source (phone) to a receiver (speaker). If you want a lag-\nfree experience make sure to invest in something that supports aptX, or AAC if\nyou\u2019re an [iOS](https://www.soundguys.com/dont-use-airpods-android-20767/)\nuser. Not only does this reduce latency, but it also allows for better\nstreaming quality (at least if you use [AAC](https://www.soundguys.com/the-\nultimate-guide-to-bluetooth-headphones-aac-20296/) with\n[iOS](https://www.soundguys.com/best-iphone-earbuds-19070/)).\n\nBluetooth isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be. While we do like\n[Bluetooth](https://www.soundguys.com/bluetooth-audio-2019-24716/) for its\nconvenience, it\u2019s not as good as wired when it comes to sound quality. We\nprobably didn\u2019t have to tell you that, but at least we [can show\nyou](https://www.soundguys.com/ultimate-guide-to-bluetooth-headphones-20019/).\n\n### Pool party people should pay attention to IP ratings\n\n[![The UE Wonderboom 2 floating in a pool. The speaker is in\nred.](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/UE_Wonderboom-2-6_floating-water-\nspeaker-1024x575.jpg)](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/UE_Wonderboom-2-6_floating-water-speaker.jpg)\n\nThe speaker can be placed directly in the pool and float about.\n\nSometimes a product\u2019s specifications will plainly read, \u201csweat-resistant,\u201d or\nsomething similar. However, if you know you\u2019re going to take your speaker on a\nboat or to the beach, you should invest in something with an official IP\nrating. [IP ratings](https://www.soundguys.com/decoding-ip-ratings-16550/)\ndenote the dust and water resistance of a particular product. Oftentimes, a\nproduct will be rated something like \u201cIPX4\u201d and the \u201cX\u201d is just a placeholder\nfor what would be a dust-resistance rating. For a product to withstand full\n[submersion](https://www.soundguys.com/waterproof-speakers-8214/), it must be\nat least IPX7 or higher.\n\n## The Marshall Stanmore II has the best audio quality\n\nThe Marshall Stanmore II continues the sonic legacy defined by its predecessor\nwith upgraded amplifiers, improved Bluetooth capabilities, and additional\ntuning controls for a bespoke listening experience.\n\n## Marshall Stanmore II\n\nBest Sound\n\n![](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Marshall-Stanmore-II-\nAngled-1024x575.png)\n\n  *   *   * \n\nMarshall Stanmore II\n\n9.2\n\n[](http://tyvm.ly/orng)\n\nThis speaker features Marshall\u2019s signature guitar-amp design which screams\n\u201caudiophile\u201d. However, the Stanmore II isn\u2019t just for show, producing a sound\nsignature that caters to virtually any genre. Lower-end sounds like bass\nguitars and synths are emphasized without dulling higher frequencies,\nretaining the clarity of acoustic guitars and vocal lines. Just be careful not\nto push this speaker over the edge, where high volumes can lead to distortion.\n\nIf you ever feel like certain frequencies are over or under-emphasized, you\ncan fine tune the sound using the treble and bass control knobs at the top of\nthe speaker. Additionally, the Marshall Bluetooth app gives you access to a\nfive-band EQ, allowing you to fully personify your listening experience. Other\nimprovements found with the Stanmore II include Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX\nsupport and multi-host Bluetooth functionality. If you need the best of the\nbest in terms of sound quality, and are willing to pay a premium, the Stanmore\nII may be the speaker for you.\n\n**Related:[Best Google Assistant smart\nspeakers](https://www.soundguys.com/best-google-assistant-speaker-21935/)**\n\n## What are some alternatives?\n\nWhen we put the [SRS-XB40](https://www.soundguys.com/sony-srs-\nxb40-review-17200/) and the [SRS-XB41](https://www.soundguys.com/sony-\nxb41-review-17414/) (two of Sony\u2019s latest speakers) head-to-head, the older\nSRS-XB40 actually [came out on top](https://www.soundguys.com/sony-xb40-vs-\nxb41-5-differences-you-should-know-17416/). But in the case of which one looks\nbetter, it\u2019s a no-brainer. The SRS-XB41 wins by a long shot here.\n\n## Sony XB41\n\n[Full Review](https://www.soundguys.com/sony-xb41-review-17414/)\n\nBest Design\n\n![](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Sony-SRS-\nXB41-1-1024x576.jpg)\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\nSony XB41\n\n7.8\n\n[](https://geni.us/7cJM)\n\nThough it\u2019s a little more expensive you get a few nice hardware upgrades, that\nmight be worth the extra cash for some people. For one, the speaker comes\nwrapped in a nice fabric that makes it easy to hold, despite its large size.\nBut it\u2019s not just for looks. That fabric also gives the speaker its [IP67\nrating](https://www.soundguys.com/decoding-ip-ratings-16550/). This means that\nwhether you want to take it to the beach or chill poolside, you won\u2019t have to\nworry about sand or water damaging it. You can even submerge it in up to a\nmeter of water for 30 minutes. Though, we obviously wouldn\u2019t recommend doing\nthat.\n\nDurability aside, the SRS-XB41 is one of the slicker Bluetooth speakers out\nthere. It has LED lights around all the edges making it just as pretty to look\nat as it sounds. Because, yes, the XB41 sounds really good. It doesn\u2019t have\nquite the same amount of clarity in the lower notes as the previous XB40 has,\nbut it\u2019s no slouch. If you want something that gets loud, can go with you\nanywhere, has crazy good battery life, and will turn heads, then this might be\nfor you. Just be prepared to pay a pretty penny for it.\n\n## For the ultimate party speaker, get the UE Hyperboom\n\nUltimate Ears has been in the Bluetooth speaker market for years now, and the\none thing its product line-up was missing was a giant speaker that could power\nyour parties. That ends with the [UE Hyperboom](https://geni.us/zDjvmpd),\nwhich is the new giant speaker from the company. This speaker has an IPX4\nsplashproof build along with a battery life that should last you about 24\nhours of constant playback.\n\n## UE Hyperboom\n\n[Full Review](https://www.soundguys.com/ue-hyperboom-review-a-bigger-\nboom-29240/)\n\nBest for parties\n\n![](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/UE-\nHyperboom-2-1024x576.jpg)\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\nUE Hyperboom\n\n7.4\n\n[](https://geni.us/zDjvmpd)\n\nThere are also a number of unique features that make this perfect for parties.\nFor one, it has two Bluetooth inputs so a second person can connect to the\nspeaker and line up the next track without disrupting the music coming from a\nfirst device. It\u2019s a simple problem to a common problem at parties. There\u2019s\nalso an optical input so when you\u2019re not using this as your party speaker you\ncan plug it into your TV for instantly better sound. While it\u2019s not going to\ngive you[ soundbar](https://www.soundguys.com/best-soundbars-6617/) level of\nquality, it\u2019s sure to be an upgrade for most people. Of course, it isn\u2019t cheap\nand not very portable but if you\u2019re after a loud speaker that sounds good and\nhas some great features this is the way to go.\n\n## For the best budget option, check out the Anker Soundcore Flare 2\n\nThe Anker Soundcore Flare 2 builds off the success of the original Flare\nspeaker, offering room-filling sound at a price that won\u2019t break the bank.\n\n## Anker Soundcore Flare 2\n\nBang for your Buck\n\n![](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Anker-Soundcore-\nFlare-2-1024x575.png)\n\n  * \n\nAnker Soundcore Flare 2\n\n9.4\n\n[](http://tyvm.ly/8LEmU)\n\nThe Flare 2 sports powerful dual drivers and passive radiators, outputting 20W\nof sound with improved clarity and bass response compared to its predecessor.\nWith an upgraded IPX7 waterproof rating, coupled with a Dual LED Halo on the\ntop and bottom, your speaker can set the tone for your party, wherever you may\nbe. EQ and lighting controls are available through the Soundcore app, where\nyou can also connect up to 100 Flare 2\u2019s to fill every crevice of your room\nwith booming sound.\n\nThe speaker boasts a 5,200 mAh battery with 12 hours of continuous playback,\nand can be charged through its USB-C port. The only real drawback is that it\nlacks a 3.5mm input jack. Still, at less than $100, it\u2019s hard to find another\nsimilarly-priced Bluetooth speaker that could compete with the Flare 2.\n\n## Best Bluetooth speakers: notable mentions\n\n[![The speaker in a sling bag which is\nunzipped.](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/UE_Wonderboom-2-3_speaker-bag-\nstorage-1024x575.jpg)](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/UE_Wonderboom-2-3_speaker-bag-storage.jpg)\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to hook the speaker onto anything, its bulbous shape makes it\ndifficult to fit into small sling bags.\n\n  * [_Anker Soundcore Flare+_](http://tyvm.ly/iaPBQs): If you\u2019re willing to fork up a little more cash, you get a more powerful speaker with significantly increased bass reproduction, compared to the Flare 2.\n  * _[Anker Soundcore Flare Mini](http://tyvm.ly/D1iBBWl)_ : If you want to save a little cash money, the Flare Mini is the little sibling of the Flare lineup: similar build quality, smaller form factor and less powerful drivers.\n  * _[JBL Charge 3](https://www.soundguys.com/jbl-charge-3-review-9360/): _While it\u2019s missing the USB-C charging and is basically the same price as the newer Charge 4, the Charge 3 is still a solid option.\n  * _[JBL Clip 3:](https://geni.us/2X8aBcX)_ The newest Clip 3 is one of the better deals in all of Bluetooth speakers, giving you a pint-sized durable speaker with a great battery life and the option to clip/hang it anywhere thanks to a built-in carabiner.\n  * _[JBL Flip 5](https://www.soundguys.com/jbl-flip-5-review-32589/)_ : If you\u2019re looking for a Bluetooth speaker that won\u2019t cost you more than $100 then the Flip series has always been a go-to. Now, there\u2019s the JBL Flip 5 which offers everything that the Flip 4 did, but with bigger drivers and USB-C charging.\n  * [_JBL Link 300_](https://www.soundguys.com/jbl-link-300-review-16889/): If you want a smart speaker with integrated Google Assistant, the JBL Link 300 is a reasonably priced option.\n  * [_Marshall Stanmore II Voice_](https://tyvm.ly/Fslq): Featuring Amazon Alexa voice control integration, this addition to the Marshall Stanmore product line is great for those who need a speaker that is smart, powerful, and adaptable to your listening preferences.\n  * _[Monster Solara](https://www.soundguys.com/monster-solara-review-15987/)_ : If you can overlook its unapologetic plastic build and large size, you\u2019ll get a unique speaker that\u2019s sure to be a head turner.\n  * _[Sony SRS-XB32](https://geni.us/Gwfpl)_ : While it suffers from many of the same flaws as its older sibling on this list, the SRS-XB32 also excels in exactly the same ways. It\u2019s a fun, tough little speaker perfect for the beach or backyard get-togethers.\n  * _[Sony SRS-XB40](https://www.soundguys.com/sony-srs-xb40-review-17200/)_ : At $79 the XB40 is hard to pass on even if it isn\u2019t the newest speaker. Though it\u2019s not as pretty, it\u2019s definitely a better value than the newer SRS-XB41 if you don\u2019t need full waterproofing. \n  * _[UE Wonderboom 2](https://www.soundguys.com/ultimate-ears-wonderboom-2-review-24505/):_ The second-generation Wonderboom is one of our favorite speakers because it\u2019s waterproof build, small size, and the ability to float. If you want to save a few bucks, the original [Wonderboom](https://www.soundguys.com/ue-wonderboom-review-12544/) works just as well.\n  * _[V-Moda Remix](https://www.soundguys.com/v-moda-remix-bluetooth-speaker-review-11597/)_ : The Remix Bluetooth speaker from V-Moda is impressive for its size, comes with some pretty cool features like a built-in headphone amp, and sounds good. But it\u2019s also pricey, which is the main reason it didn\u2019t make our list.\n\n## How we chose the best Bluetooth speakers\n\n[![Sony SRS-XB40 Bluetooth speakers being held.](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/04/Sony-SRS-\nXB40-6-1024x576.jpg)](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/04/Sony-SRS-XB40-6.jpg)\n\nThe XB40 is a little bigger than I thought it\u2019d be.\n\nThere are thousands and thousands of Bluetooth speakers in the world and it\u2019d\nbe impossible for us to review them all, but that doesn\u2019t stop us from trying\nto get our grubby hands on all of them. If a speaker made it onto this list,\nthen you can be sure we\u2019ve had first-hand experience with them and in many\ncases put them through our entire review process.\n\nNot only do we directly review and test as many audio products as we can, but\nwe also take into account what others are saying about a given product. We\nwant our readers to be happy with their purchases and that means we had to\nnarrow down what it means to be \u201cthe best Bluetooth speaker.\u201d In this case, we\nneeded it to sound good, be relatively affordable, and durable. If a speaker\u2019s\nintended use is for camping or hiking, we made sure that it\u2019s received an\nofficial IP rating. Generally, if Bluetooth speakers perform well, there\u2019s no\nneed to overspend for the sake of overspending.\n\n## Why you should trust _SoundGuys_\n\nWorking this site is each of our day jobs and we\u2019re committed to streamlining\nthe research and purchasing process for our readers.

For one, there's the [JBL Clip\n3](https://www.soundguys.com/jbl-clip-3-review-22921/) which has a built-in\ncarabiner that's the closest thing I can think of to a hook. It's also super\naffordable and one of the best values you're going to find in the Bluetooth\nspeaker market if you want something portable. Sticking with JBL you can also\ngo with the [Flip 4](https://www.soundguys.com/jbl-flip-4-review-13036/) or\nthe [Flip 5](https://geni.us/Liveim). The Flip 4 has a built-in string so you\ncan hang it. The Flip 5 on the other hand does not come with the string to\nhang it but it does have the same attachment point so you'll just have to\nbring your own string (I recommend some [paracord](https://geni.us/rBtI85)).\nThere's also the [Bose SoundLink Micro](https://www.soundguys.com/bose-\nsoundlink-micro-review-17050/) speaker which has a plastic clip along the back\nof it so you can clip it to things like thin poles or a backpack strap. If\nnone of those appeal to you then you can also go with the [UE Wonderboom\n2](https://www.soundguys.com/ultimate-ears-wonderboom-2-review-24505/), the\n[House of Marley No Bounds XL](https://www.soundguys.com/house-of-marley-no-\nbounds-xl-review-21339/), the [Jam Hang Up](https://www.soundguys.com/jam-\nhang-up-review-20910/), or even the [Polk Audio Boom Swimmer\nDuo](https://geni.us/OshbFj) all of which have some method of hanging them.\nAgain, none of these are exactly a hook so I apologize if that's specifically\nwhat you were looking for but as they all have some method of hanging I hope\nthis was helpful!\n\nWhich speaker is the best for home parties?\n\nFor house parties we'd recommend going with the UE Hyperboom. It's loud,\nsounds good, is IPX4 splashproof for...rain, and it also has two Bluetooth\ninputs. This means that while one person is playing music, a second person can\npair to it in the background and queue up a song without interrupting what's\nplaying.\n\n[Best](https://www.soundguys.com/best/ \"View all posts in Best\") [Bluetooth\nSpeakers](https://www.soundguys.com/speakers/bluetooth-speakers/ \"View all\nposts in Bluetooth Speakers\") [Speakers](https://www.soundguys.com/speakers/\n\"View all posts in Speakers\")\n\n[Sony](https://www.soundguys.com/tag/sony/ \"Sony Tag\"),\n[JBL](https://www.soundguys.com/tag/jbl/ \"JBL Tag\"),\n[Anker](https://www.soundguys.com/tag/anker/ \"Anker Tag\"),\n[UE](https://www.soundguys.com/tag/ue/ \"UE Tag\"),\n[Marshall](https://www.soundguys.com/tag/marshall/ \"Marshall Tag\")\n\n[Anker](https://www.soundguys.com/tag/anker/),\n[JBL](https://www.soundguys.com/tag/jbl/),\n[Marshall](https://www.soundguys.com/tag/marshall/),\n[Sony](https://www.soundguys.com/tag/sony/),\n[UE](https://www.soundguys.com/tag/ue/)\n\n## You may also like\n\n[ ](https://www.soundguys.com/best-headphones-under-100-5797/)\n\n#### Best headphones under $100\n\n19 hours ago3 comments\n\n[ ](https://www.soundguys.com/cheap-bluetooth-speakers-50-4475/)\n\n#### Best cheap Bluetooth speakers under $50\n\n4 days ago22 comments\n\n[ ](https://www.soundguys.com/best-wireless-headphones-2595/)\n\n#### Best wireless headphones of 2020\n\n4 days ago18 comments\n\n[ ](https://www.soundguys.com/best-bluetooth-speakers-100-4700/)\n\n#### Best Bluetooth speakers under $100\n\n4 days ago3 comments\n\n[ ](https://www.soundguys.com/best-on-ear-headphones-100-6900/)\n\n#### Best on-ear headphones under $100\n\n6 days ago\n\n[ ](https://www.soundguys.com/anker-soundcore-liberty-air-review-21096/)\n\n#### Anker Soundcore Liberty Air review\n\n1 week ago\n\n8.3\n\nSCORE\n\n[](/)\n\n  * [About Us](https://www.soundguys.com/about/)\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.soundguys.com/privacy-policy/)\n  * [Contact](https://www.soundguys.com/contact/)\n\n  \n\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 2020 SoundGuys, All Rights Reserved.\n\n  * [](http://www.facebook.com/realsoundguys) [](https://twitter.com/realsoundguys) [](https://www.youtube.com/user/soundguysvideo?sub_confirmation=1) [](http://www.instagram.com/realsoundguys/) [](/feed)\n\n  * [About Us](https://www.soundguys.com/about/)\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.soundguys.com/privacy-policy/)\n  * [Contact](https://www.soundguys.com/contact/)\n\n![Quantcast](//pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-q9k_NA88g-_4M.gif)\n\n"}
