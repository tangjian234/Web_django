They free you of\ncables, letting you consume music on the go without being physically tethered\nto your portable devices: smartphones, tablets, and\n[laptops](https://www.laptopmag.com/laptops). Even better, they pack lots of\nperformance \u2013 great sound, call quality, and special features \u2013 into a compact\ndesign.\n\nAs the category continues to grow in popularity, so does the demand for\nwireless earbuds, especially with modern smartphones slowly doing away with\nthe headphone jack. Le sigh. Nonetheless, this hasn\u2019t stopped tech staples\nlike Sony, Samsung, and even Apple from releasing stellar cordless buds. We\u2019re\nalso seeing other popular electronics brands such as Jabra and Anker jump on\nthe wireless earbuds\u2019 bandwagon, releasing superior products that hold their\nown against the top dogs.\n\n  * The [best noise cancelling headphones of 2020](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-noise-cancelling-headphones)\n  * [Best wireless headphones](https://www.laptopmag.com/best-picks/best-wireless-headphones) for every budget and occasion\n\nIn compiling a list of the best wireless earbuds, we take many variables into\naccount, from battery life to connectivity to design to sound. Other notable\nhallmarks such as mobile app support, setup, and special features are factored\ninto the equation as well.\n\nAfter testing the market\u2019s top offerings, we\u2019ve ranked the best wireless\nearbuds based on budget, performance, and style. Scroll down to see which ones\nbest suit your listening needs.\n\n## What are the best wireless earbuds?\n\nThe [Apple AirPods Pro](https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/apple-airpods-pro)\ncurrently stand as the best wireless earbuds due to their enhanced fit,\nseamless iOS/MacOS functionality, and surprisingly good active noise\ncancellation. We\u2019ve found these cordless danglers to be _the_ ideal companion\nfor all Apple devices. They also work with Android and\n[Windows](https://www.laptopmag.com/windows) devices via Bluetooth, though the\nsetup process can be a bit arduous.\n\nComing in a close second is the recently launched Jabra Elite Active 75t,\nwhich earned a perfect score on our sister site, [Tom\u2019s\nGuide](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/jabra-elite-active-75t-wireless-\nearbuds), for its remarkable all-around performance. While designed for\nfitness use, it is still an excellent everyday pair of wireless earbuds with\ndynamic sound, solid battery life, and lots of personalized features that\nenhance functionality.\n\nThose on the hunt for Android-friendly wireless earbuds may want to look at\nall-new Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus. They have better battery life and sound than\nthe AirPods Pro and plenty of neat features. Not to mention they work well\nacross all OS platforms.\n\nSony\u2019s game-changing WF-1000xM3 is the best noise cancelling model in the\ncategory, offering first-class sound and ANC in a deluxe package. These\nearbuds also have cool features like adjustable ambient listening to hear your\nsurroundings more clearly and NFC support for instant pairing to compatible\ndevices.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the best wireless earbuds don\u2019t always come at a\npremium. There are a handful of models \u2013 the Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 and\ngamer-centric Razer Hammerhead to name a few \u2013 listed under $100 that make for\ngreat AirPods\u2019 alternatives as well.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a business traveler who requires complete silence in flight or\njust an avid music lover who wants amazing sound in a tinier form, there\u2019s a\nmodel on our list of best wireless earbuds tailored to your ears.\n\n## The best wireless earbuds you can buy today\n\n![best wireless earbuds: Apple AirPods\nPro](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/laptopmag/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Regan Coule/Tom's Guide)\n\n### 1\\. Apple AirPods Pro\n\nThe best wireless earbuds overall\n\n **Size:** 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches | **Weight:** 0.19 ounces (per bud) |\n**Battery life (Rated):** 4.5 hours, 24 hours (with charging case) |\n**Bluetooth range:** 800 feet | **Digital assistant support:** Yes\n\nEffective active noise cancelation\n\nAdaptive EQ\n\nClean, balanced sound\n\nLower battery life than the AirPods 2\n\nNo companion app\n\nApple made almost every change necessary to make the AirPods Pro the best\nwireless earbuds that money can buy. Fans wanted active noise cancellation and\ngot just that, which is superbly effective, thanks to Apple\u2019s multi-mic system\nthat uses two mics on each bud to analyze ambient sound and cancels it out\nbefore reaching the soundstage. The technology is intuitive and blocks out\nabout 85% of street noise.\n\nThe included ear tips also make a world of difference in fit and sound. They\ncreate a comfy, tight seal around the canal that ensures the Pods don\u2019t slip\nout when rushing to catch the bus. It\u2019s this personalized fit, along with\nApple\u2019s all-new Adaptive EQ, that also makes music sound fuller. Gym rats and\ngamers who sweat profusely no longer have to worry about damaging their buds\neither, as Apple made the AirPods Pro water and sweat resistant.\n\n _Read our full_[ _Apple AirPods Pro\nreview_](https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/apple-airpods-pro) _._\n\n![best wireless earbuds: Jabra Elite Active\n75t](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/laptopmag/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Regan Coule/Tom's Guide)\n\n### 2\\. Jabra Elite Active 75t\n\nPractically perfect wireless earbuds\n\n **Size:** 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.6 inches | **Weight:** 0.19 ounces (per bud) |\n**Battery life (Rated):** 7.5 hours, 28 hours (with charging case) |\n**Bluetooth range:** 30 feet (10 meters) | **Digital assistant support:** Yes\n\nEnergetic soundstage\n\nWaterproof design\n\nSolid overall battery life\n\nNewly announced features currently unavailable\n\nCan get too loud at max volume\n\nWe didn\u2019t think Jabra was capable of improving on near-perfection, but they\ndefinitely showed out with their latest release. The Elite Active 75t takes\neverything that made its predecessor, the Elite Active 65t, one of the best\nwireless earbuds for casual listening and fitness and turned the performance\nknob up to 11. Jabra shrunk the design by 22%, while nearly doubling the\nbattery life on both the buds and charging case. The waterproof coating is\nalso great for exercising and does a phenomenal job of absorbing wetness to\nprevent slippage.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more remarkable is how powerful the audio is on these sporty buds;\nsound is lively and lends itself well to all music genres. Access to the Jabra\nSound+ app broadens the buds\u2019 sonic capabilities by allowing you to play with\nthe EQ or select from one of five band presets.\n\n![best wireless earbuds: Samsung Galaxy Buds\nPlus](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/laptopmag/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n### 3\\. Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus\n\nThe best wireless earbuds for Android users\n\n **Size:** 0.7 x 0.75 x 0.8 inches | **Weight:** 0.22 ounces | **Battery life\n(Rated):** 11 hours, 22 hours (with charging case) | **Bluetooth range:** 120\nfeet (36 meters) | **Digital assistant support:** Yes\n\nIndustry-leading battery life\n\nCrisp, balanced sound powered by AKG-tuned drivers\n\nHandy companion app\n\nTouch controls can be unresponsive at times\n\nSame design as the original Galaxy Buds\n\nWant a great pair of wireless earbuds that operates smoothly across multiple\nplatforms? Here it is. The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus doesn\u2019t just play nicely\nwith iOS and Android devices, but also offers more battery life, better sound,\nand cooler wireless features (e.g. reverse charging with any compatible\nSamsung Galaxy phone) than the AirPods Pro. Having 11 hours of playtime on a\nsingle charge is such a huge deal, giving users lengthier playtimes in between\ncharges. The pill-shaped charging case doubles that number and supports faster\nquick charging to get you 1 hour of use on a 3-minute charge.\n\nAKG\u2019s dual-tuned speakers pump out clean and lively audio. The buds also have\ntheir own iOS and Android apps, which lets you personalize the sound and touch\ncontrols, though the latter blesses you with more perks such as Spotify\nintegration and a Gaming mode with dedicated EQ.\n\n _Read our full_[ _Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus\nreview_](https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus) _._\n\n![best wireless earbuds: Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless\n2](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/laptopmag/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Laptop Mag)\n\n### 4\\. Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2\n\nANC and Sennheiser sound for a premium\n\n **Size:** 3.02 x 1.72 x 1.3 inches | **Weight:** 0.2 ounces (per bud) |\n**Battery life (Rated):** 7 hours, 28 hours (with charging case) | **Bluetooth\nrange:** 800 feet (243 meters) | **Digital Assistant Support:** Yes\n\nSuperb audio performance\n\nClean, minimalist design\n\nLonger battery life than its predecessor\n\nStrong active noise cancellation\n\nMore expensive than the AirPods Pro\n\nUncomfortable for smaller ears\n\nBasically, Sennheiser repackaged its popular wireless earbuds with a bigger\nbattery and active noise cancellation, and the end product is undeniable. The\nMomentum True Wireless 2\u2019s ANC performance is up there with the AirPods Pro,\nusing a single mic on each bud to minimize ambient sound at high levels; loud\nTVs and noisy neighbors will go unnoticed. Playtime has been increased from 4\nto 7 hours, with the gorgeous slate gray fabric charging case housing an extra\n3 charges. These buds also retain the beautiful sound of the original,\ndelivering sumptuous audio with precise detail, which can also be personalized\nvia Sennheiser Smart Control app, though the default profile is great as is.\n\nThose with small ears and pockets will find the Momentum True Wireless 2 less\nenticing, as the buds don\u2019t provide the best comfort or fit for tiny ear\nholes, while the upscale price tag ($300) makes them one of the more expensive\noptions in the category.\n\n _See our full_[ _Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2\nreview_](https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/sennheiser-momentum-true-\nwireless-2-earbuds) _._\n\n![best wireless earbuds: Google Pixel Buds\n2](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/laptopmag/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Regan Coule/Laptop Magazine)\n\n### 5\\. Google Pixel Buds 2\n\nThe wireless buds finally live up to the hype\n\n**Size:** 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.7 inches | **Weight:** 0.18 ounces | **Battery Life\n(Rated):** 5 hours | **Bluetooth range:** 120 feet (36 meters) | **Digital\nassistant support:** Yes\n\nRich, precise audio\n\nStylish, durable and comfortable design\n\nSeamless translation technology\n\nLacks active noise cancelation\n\nVolume is a bit quiet\n\nNo equalizer\n\nGoogle\u2019s back and the Pixel Buds 2 are better than ever. First off, they\u2019re\nactually wireless this time around. Next, they\u2019re comfortable and sound good,\nnot exactly on a par with the leading brands, but not far off either. Best of\nall, at $179, it\u2019s cheaper than most of the competition. But the Pixel Buds 2\nclaim to fame is its seamless translation services by way of Google Translate,\nwhich allows you to have a conversation with real-time translation.\n\nThe earbuds also offer near-instant pairing, a solid Bluetooth connection and\nnearly 5 hours of battery life. You also get Adaptive Sound, which\nautomatically adjusts volume depending on your surroundings. The Buds are\nimmensely comfortable and offer a smidgen of durability with its sweat and\nwater resistance. If you\u2019re searching for a pair of attractive, affordable\ntruly wireless earbuds, you can\u2019t go wrong with the Google Pixel Buds.\n\n _Read our full_[ _Google Pixel Buds 2\nreview_](https://www.laptopmag.com/google-pixel-buds-review) _._\n\n![best wireless earbuds: Anker Soundcore Liberty Air\n2](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/laptopmag/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Regan Coule/Laptop Magazine)\n\n### 6\\. Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2\n\nAn awesome AirPods alternative for cheap\n\n **Size:** 2 x 2.2 x 1 inches | **Weight:** TBD | **Battery life (Rated):** 7\nhours, 28 hours (with charging case) | **Bluetooth range:** 35 feet |\n**Digital assistant support:** Yes\n\nSound better than all AirPods models\n\nAdaptive listening features\n\nImpressive call quality\n\nTouch controls are wonky\n\nSame unattractive long-stem design as the AirPods\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being labelled an AirPods clone, especially when\nthe product grants better audio, battery life, and more color options (White\nAND Black) for under $100. Anker went all out stuffing the Soundcore Liberty\nAir 2 with as many powerful specs as possible: including 4 mics with noise\nreduction technology, diamond-coated drivers, personalized sound features, and\na 7-hour battery.\n\nYou\u2019ll experience some nice clarity and depth when listening to music, which\nalso carries over to phone calls. It\u2019s also cool that you can use the buds in\nstereo or mono mode. The Soundcore app extends functionality to customize the\ncontrols and sound; you can choose from multiple presets or select the HearID\nfeature to have the buds create a sound profile based on your hearing\nsensibility. How many models do you know in the same price range that can pull\nthat off?\n\n![best wireless earbuds: Sony\nWF-1000xM3](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/laptopmag/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Regan Coule/Tom's Guide)\n\n### 7\\. Sony WF-1000xM3 Wireless Earbuds\n\nThe best noise cancelling wireless earbuds\n\n **Size:** 5.6 x 4.7 x 2.5 inches | **Weight:** 0.3 ounces | **Battery life\n(Rated):** 6 hours (NC on), 8 hours (NC off) | **Bluetooth range:** 30 feet\n(10 meters) | **Digital assistant support:** Yes\n\nBest-in-class ANC\n\nFull, vibrant sound\n\nStrong battery life across the board\n\nFinicky touch controls\n\nCall quality isn't great\n\nIf you\u2019re the type who looks to enjoy their Apple Music library with fewer\noutside distractions, then it\u2019s the Sony WF-1000xM3 you want. These aren\u2019t\njust the best wireless earbuds for noise cancelation \u2013 they happen to be one\nof the best-sounding models as well. The combination of a dual-mic system and\nSony\u2019s HD Noise Canceling Processor QN1e neutralizes noise from all angles.\nThose who want to be more mindful of their surroundings can enable the Ambient\nSound Control option, which can be adjusted in the companion app to let in as\nmuch background noise as you want.\n\nBass remains at the heart of Sony\u2019s sound signature, and while it\u2019s boomy, it\ncreates enough room for detailed mids and highs to serenade your ears.\nMultiple presets are programmed into the app that you can select; each one is\nfine-tuned and complements their respective music genres. With ANC known for\nsucking up lots of power, the WF-1000xM3 holds an impressive 6-hour charge (8\nhours with ANC off), which is perfect for round-trip flights.\n\n![best wireless earbuds: Anker Soundcore Spirit Dot\n2](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/laptopmag/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Regan Coule/Laptop Magazine)\n\n### 8\\. Anker Soundcore Spirit Dot 2\n\nEntry-level buds with amazing sound\n\n **Size:** 1.00 x 0.74 x 0.96 inches | **Weight:** 0.23 ounces (per bud) |\n**Battery life (Rated):** 5.5 hours, 21 hours (with charging case) |\n**Bluetooth range:** 35 feet (10.5 meters) | **Digital assistant support:**\nYes\n\nPunchy bass\n\nTight, secure fit\n\nSweat- and waterproof\n\nLoaded with accessories\n\nNo companion app or extra features\n\nHighs sound faint\n\nThe Spirit Dot 2 stands out as one of the best wireless earbuds under $100,\nthanks to its sporty aesthetics and high-tech functionality. Anker designed\nthese buds to be sweatproof and waterproof, draping the exterior with IPX7\ncoating, which is one of the highest ratings in the category. Comfort and fit\nare guaranteed with Anker bundling a host of ear tips and wings to accommodate\ndifferent ear shapes. Where you really get your money\u2019s worth is in bass\nresponse, as the buds pump out powerful lows that don\u2019t compromise the sound\nwith unwanted distortion.\n\nWith a lower price comes compromises. In the case of the Spirit Dot 2, it\u2019s\nzero access to the [Soundcore\napp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oceanwing.soundcore&hl=en_US),\nwhich means you\u2019re missing out on popular features (e.g. customizable EQ,\nHearID) that could enhance audio quality. Criticism aside, you\u2019re afforded\nmuch more performance than the cost-friendly MSRP would suggest; $80 for these\nbuds is steal.\n\n _Read our full_[ _Anker Soundcore Spirit Dot 2\nreview_](https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/anker-soundcore-spirit-dot-2) _._\n\n![best wireless earbuds: Microsoft Surface\nEarbuds](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/laptopmag/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Laptop Mag)\n\n### 9\\. Microsoft Surface Earbuds\n\nProductivity buds for Windows lovers\n\n **Size:** 0.7 x 0.98 x 0.98 inches | **Weight:** 0.23 ounces (per bud) |\n**Battery life (Rated):** 8 hours, 24 hours (with charging case) | **Bluetooth\nrange:** 800 feet (243 meters) | **Digital assistant support:** Yes\n\nIncredibly comfortable fit\n\nPersonalized audio\n\nMicrosoft 365 integration\n\nLong battery life\n\nSurface Audio app needs more features\n\nPolarizing design\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s first attempt at truly wireless earbuds is a respectable one that\ncan benefit from a less-awkward design and more features. Still, the Surface\nEarbuds are a promising creation that rewards Windows users with some cool\nproductivity tools, along with solid audio and battery life. Unique features\nlike voice dictation for Microsoft 365 works surprisingly well, producing\nlightning-fast and accurate transcriptions in Word documents; using Live\nCaptions in PowerPoint is fun too, and lets you do so in real-time translation\nin over 60 languages. But let\u2019s not mistake these buds for just a great\nWindows companion, as they perform excellently across all platforms, including\nAndroid and iOS.\n\nThe two 13.6-millimeter drivers dish out loud and clean sound, though we felt\naudio was fuller on the AirPods Pro. Luckily, you can toy around with the EQ\nin the Surface Audio app to improve sonic output. The one edge Microsoft\u2019s\nbuds have over Apple\u2019s is lengthier playtime, generating 8 hours of use on a\nsingle charge.\n\n _See our full_[ _Microsoft Surface Earbuds\nreview_](https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-earbuds) _._\n\n![best wireless earbuds: JBL Live\n300TWS](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/laptopmag/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Regan Coule/Laptop Magazine)\n\n### 10\\. JBL Live 300TWS\n\nSuper durable with amazing midrange\n\n **Size:** 1.7 x 1.3 x 1.2 inches | **Weight:** 0.2 ounces (per bud) |\n**Battery Life (Rated):** 5 hours (NC on), 11 hours (NC off), 33 hours (with\ncharging case) | **Bluetooth range:** 10 feet (33 meters) | **Digital\nassistant support:** Yes\n\nClear, lively mids\n\nSturdy construction\n\nIntelligible controls\n\nCompanion app with sound customization\n\nWeak bass response\n\nBulky and uncomfortable\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who prioritizes build quality and sound personalization,\nthen the JBL Live 300TWS is worth a look, especially on discount (Dell\ncurrently sells it for $120). The outer shell is composed of hard-shell\nplastic with IPX5 coating for sweat- and water-resistant protection. Style\nisn\u2019t compromised either, as shiny accents, along with a variety of sleek\ncolorways give these buds a ruggedly handsome appearance. Touch controls tend\nto be hit or miss on wireless earbuds, but JBL gets the feature right,\nprogramming multiple functions that respond quickly to taps and swipes.\n\nJBL\u2019s signature bass-forward profile is MIA, which makes hip-hop records and\nrock songs sound less emphatic. However, the mid-range is some of the best\nwe\u2019ve heard in the category, resulting in stellar vocal reproduction. Access\nto the companion app also lets you tweak sound to your hearing.\n\n _Read our full_[ _JBL Live 300TWS\nreview_](https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/jbl-live-300tws) _._\n\n## How to choose the best wireless earbuds for you\n\nBattery life is most crucial when searching for the best wireless earbuds.\nMost models offer 4 to 8 hours on a single charge. Make sure the buds come\nbundled with a charging case too, so to keep them charged and stowed away\nduring commutes. Charging cases can provide multiple charges and hold anywhere\nbetween 12 to 40+ hours of additional playtime.\n\nDesign is just as important. Ideally, you want a pair of buds that offer\npersonalized fit and comfort, along with multiple ear tips to accommodate\ndifferent ear shapes. Durability and water-resistant protection shouldn\u2019t be\noverlooked either.\n\nNext up is audio, which applies to all media formats (e.g. music, videos,\ngames) and phone calls. Explore models with powerful drivers and customization\nsettings that allow you to tweak sound profiles to your liking.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget wireless functionality. Many wireless earbuds come programmed\nwith [Bluetooth 5.0](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/bluetooth-5-faq),\nwhich gives users faster connectivity, increased range (est. 120 meters max),\nlonger battery life, and multipoint pairing to connect to two audio sources\nsimultaneously. Digital assistant support (Siri, Google, and Alexa) falls\nunder this section as well.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing more wireless earbuds boast advanced features like an adaptive EQ\nand active noise cancellation. These are features well worth spending on extra\non, if engineered properly, and will be more common as the category evolves.\n\n## How we test the best wireless earbuds\n\nWhen testing for the best wireless earbuds, Laptop Magazine evaluates several\nfactors: design, comfort, sound, and value just to name a few.
