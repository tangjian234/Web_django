It's a\nversatile speaker, one that stands solidly alongside the built-for-home Sonos\nspeakers that the company made its name on.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect \u2013 it\u2019s heavy as a byproduct of its incredible sound, it\u2019s\nexpensive due to its rich feature set, and it sadly can\u2019t be used as rear\nchannels for a home cinema set-up. But if you\u2019ve got the money, it\u2019s hard to\nfault the Sonos Move when it comes to hunting down the very best Bluetooth\nspeaker in the world.\n\n **Read the full review:** [Sonos Move\nreview](https://web.archive.org/web/20200402230102/https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/sonos-\nmove-review)\n\n  * [Is Apple about to buy smart speaker giant Sonos?](https://www.techradar.com/news/is-apple-about-to-buy-smart-speaker-giant-sonos)\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n![ue boom 3](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Ultimate Ears)\n\n### 2\\.

Check out the [best\nstereo speakers](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-stereo-speakers). Bored\nof your TV's lackluster audio? Try one of our [best\nsoundbars](https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/home-cinema-audio/tr-\ntop-10-best-soundbars-1288008) or [Dolby Atmos\nspeakers](https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/dolby-atmos-a-step-by-step-\nguide-to-the-premature-speaker-tech-1305066) on for size.\n\nIf you need a speaker you can take everywhere, make sure you look at the [best\nwaterproof speakers](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-waterproof-speaker).\n\nFor total control of your smart home, invest in one of the [best smart\nspeakers](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-smart-speakers), which come with\n[Google Assistant](https://www.techradar.com/how-to/google-assistant-how-to-\nmake-your-google-home-speaker-work-for-you), Amazon Alexa, or Siri built-in.\n\nThere are so many new Bluetooth speakers on the market these days with great\ndesigns and the latest tech built-in that it can be tricky to figure out which\none you need. Although it may seem like the choice is endless, there are\nplenty with unique selling points that'll suit you.\n\nFirst up, some portable speakers are built with ultimate durability in mind,\nothers are weather and waterproof for camping and tunes by the pool; however,\nsome aren't fit for the outdoors and would look pretty inside your home\ninstead.\n\nIf you're having trouble figuring out which is the best Bluetooth speaker for\nyou, start by picturing where you're going to use it and find a speaker that\nmatches that setting. That means if you're a beach person, water and dust-\nproofing in your outdoor speaker are key.\n\nOr, if you're a party person, you might want the ability to connect two\nspeakers together or a speaker with multi-point pairing that allows multiple\ndevices to connect at a time. Battery life, sound quality, and design are\nparamount for all speakers, and we've done our best to take these in the\nutmost consideration when creating our list.\n\n  * Read our latest Bluetooth speaker review: [Bang & Olufsen Beosound A1 (2nd gen)](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/bang-and-olufsen-beosound-a1-2nd-gen)\n\n### Bluetooth speaker deals\n\nRound up of today's best deals\n\nSonos Move -
