No wonder JBL is one of the best-selling wireless\nspeaker brands on the market.\n\nNow JBL is turning its attention to the Bluetooth headphone market with a new\nrange of new \u2018Live\u2019 models that it hopes will do as well as the company\u2019s\nrange of Bluetooth speakers. A couple of weeks ago I got to spend some quality\ntime reviewing JBL\u2019s new flagship wireless headphone before they were\nannounced to the public today so this may be one of the first reviews to be\npublished.\n\nThe JBL Live 650BTNC are an attractive pair of headphones that are available\nwhite, black or blue finishes. Their styling has a bit of Beats about it and\nlooks pretty cool. However, what really stands out with this top-end pair of\nwireless headphones is that they are Alexa and Google Assist compatible. You\nget to choose which voice-assisted platform works for you and then you select\nthat in the JBL My Headphones app. Once set up, it\u2019s a case of simply touching\neither of the ear cups and issuing an order such as asking the time or\nrequesting your favorite radio station. It\u2019s a neat solution and the first\npair of headphones I\u2019ve seen that offers the choice of both Amazon's and\nGoogle's platforms in a single model.\n\nMost Popular In: [Consumer Tech](https://www.forbes.com/consumer-tech)\n\n  * [\n\n### Apple\u2019s Surprise iPhone 12 Pro Upgrade Suddenly Confirmed\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2020/07/15/apples-iphone-12-pro-\nmax-ram-storage-upgrade-iphone-11-pro-max/)\n\n  * [\n\n### China\u2019s Closed.

[+] headphones.\n\nJBL\n\nAs well as looking cool, the JBL Live 650BTNC feel reasonably comfy when worn.\nThe fit is firm without making it feel like your head is being held in a\nclamp. You could probably even jog wearing these headphones without fearing\nthey\u2019d fall off. The headband is adjustable and padded, while the ear cushions\nare made of a soft vinyl material that feels nice and didn\u2019t make my ears feel\nsweaty or uncomfortable. The earpads aren\u2019t huge, so if you do have ears\napproaching elephantine proportions, you might want to try them for size first\nbefore committing to buy. The left-hand ear cup sports a Micro USB charging\nport for topping up the Lithium-Ion battery, while the right-hand ear cup has\na power switch, volume controls, and a multi-function button for pausing\nmusic, taking phone calls, or for skipping and repeating music tracks.\nFinally, there\u2019s a button for turning Bluetooth on or off, and another button\nfor switching between active noise-canceling and passive noise-canceling. It\u2019s\nall pretty easy to use and once you\u2019ve committed the controls to muscle\nmemory, it\u2019s easy to operate by touch alone.\n\nThe JBL Live 650BTNC are set up like most other Bluetooth headphones; you\nsimply pair them with your smartphone and begin streaming audio from up to 10\nmeters from your phone, tablet or computer. The headphones only need to be\npaired once, then every time they\u2019re turned on they will connect to your\nstreaming device. That\u2019s all there is to it. With a fully charged battery,\nwhich takes just a couple of hours to top up, these headphones can deliver up\nto 20 hours of playing time, which is more than enough for a long return\nflight across the Pacific. If the headphones are used without noise canceling\nturned on, its' possible to get up to 30 hours of Bluetooth playtime.\n\nAs already mentioned, this flagship model from JBL incorporates an active\nnoise-canceling feature, which means it has built-in microphones that sample\nany extraneous noises in the environment and then filters them out. The\nheadphones can be worn without playing music and used simply as a pair of\nhigh-tech ear defenders, or they can be used to play music, making tunes much\neasier to hear and appreciate as most of the surrounding noises are cut\ndramatically. If you\u2019ve never tried active noise-canceling headphones during a\nflight or a railway journey, you\u2019re missing a treat. It\u2019s so much easier to\nhear music without the horrendous background roar of jet engines spoiling the\nmusic.\n\nAs a matter of course, the JBL Live 650BTNC headphones invoke the active\nnoise-canceling circuitry as soon as they\u2019re powered up, but I\u2019d quite like to\nbe able to change that default behavior as you don\u2019t always want or need to\nuse active noise-canceling, especially if you\u2019re at home in a quiet room. The\nwireless Bluetooth function works well delivering a good quality of sound,\nalthough there isn\u2019t any support for the higher quality audio codecs such as\naptX and AAC. This is a bit of missed opportunity, in my opinion, and\nsomething JBL ought to have included in order to better compete with other\nmodels on the market that do support those codecs.\n\nAlthough the higher quality codecs can be overkill when used in conjunction\nwith the active noise-canceling circuitry, if you\u2019re just using the headphones\nin Bluetooth mode, it would be nice to know you\u2019re getting the best audio\nquality possible rather than the bog-standard SBC protocol. Don\u2019t get me\nwrong, the SBC quality isn\u2019t bad, it\u2019s just that it could be even better. One\nhandy Bluetooth feature of the JBL Live 650BTNC is the multipoint facility\nthat enables two Bluetooth devices to connect to the headphones. And why on\nearth would you want to connect two sources to the headphones? Simple\u2026 you\nmight have a work phone that you use to take business calls, while your music\nmay be on your personal smartphone or MP3 player. With multipoint, you can\nhave both connected to your headphones and take business calls on the\ntreadmill as well as listening to your exercise playlist.\n\nThe folding design of the JBL Live 650BTNC means the headphones take up less\nspace in your luggage... [+] or work bag.\n\nJBL\n\nThe sound of these flagship wireless headphones from JBL is well balanced.\nThere\u2019s enough bass for most people\u2019s tastes and the treble is detailed enough\nwithout being harsh or grating. The mid-range holds back just a little, but as\nan all-round pair of headphones, the JBL Live 650BTNC strike the right balance\nand will tick most people\u2019s boxes. Incidentally, if the battery charge does\nrun out, it\u2019s possible to plug the headphones into a standard 3.5mm stereo\njack output using the supplied audio cable. It\u2019s then possible to carry on\nlistening to music, albeit without any noise canceling.\n\nWhen it comes to the performance of the active noise-canceling circuitry, the\nJBL Live 650BTNC headphones do a pretty good job. However, I\u2019m not entirely\nsure that they\u2019re up there with the very best-in-class headphones from the\nlikes of [Bose](http://www.forbes.com/sites/marksparrow/2016/12/19/bose-has-\ncut-the-cord-of-its-new-baby-the-qc35-bluetooth-noise-cancelling-headphones/),\n[Sennheiser](http://www.forbes.com/sites/marksparrow/2017/07/16/can-\nsennheisers-noise-cancelling-headphones-beat-the-mighty-bose-qc35/), and\n[Sony](http://www.forbes.com/sites/marksparrow/2018/10/13/sonys-brand-new-\nnoise-canceling-headphones-reviewed-and-rated/) in terms of noise-blocking\nefficacy and comfort. However, for most people\u2019s needs, these headphones do\nthe job, and they do it well, at a price that\u2019s affordable. The entire package\nis really pleasing with a nice and small form factor, plus foldable ear cups\nthat make the headphones small enough to stow away in the supplied carrying\nbag.\n\nThe new design of the JBL Live 650BTNC Bluetooth headphones will appeal to all\nages.\n\nJBL\n\n**Verdict:** These new and attractive JBL Live 650BTNC headphones offer good\nwireless performance and effective active noise-cancelation at a price point\nsome 30% lower than the market-leading models from Bose and Sony. The styling\nis good and the sound is more than adequate. Comfort may be an issue for some\npeople so it\u2019s worth comparing them with the [Bose\nQC35](http://www.forbes.com/sites/marksparrow/2016/12/19/bose-has-cut-the-\ncord-of-its-new-baby-the-qc35-bluetooth-noise-cancelling-headphones/) and\n[Sony\u2019s WH1000XM3](http://www.forbes.com/sites/marksparrow/2018/10/13/sonys-\nbrand-new-noise-canceling-headphones-reviewed-and-rated/) models, which I\nreviewed last year. Comfort is very important with headphones if you intend\nwearing them for eight hours at a stretch. Not many models can pass that\ncomfort test for me. If you love that beefy JBL sound then you\u2019ll love the new\nJBL Live 650BTNC headphones.
