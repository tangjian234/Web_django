But we think you should be able to\nhave it all. So with the help of audio professionals from BuzzFeed\u2019s podcast\nteam, we tested some of the top-selling industry-standard headphones on the\nmarket, paying mind to clarity, comfort, and \u2014 not least of all \u2014 Bluetooth\nreliability, to determine the best wireless headphones across three price\npoints.\n\n###### ADVERTISEMENT\n\n![](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/wp-content/themes/worthit/assets/red-tag-\none.png)\n\n## Mpow 059 Headphones\n\nStarting from $38.99\n\n### The Details\n\n#### 20+ Hours Battery Life\n\n#### Available in seven Colors\n\n#### 33-Foot Bluetooth range\n\n#### Passive Noise isolation\n\n#### Plastic Shell\n\n#### Stainless-Steel Sliders\n\n#### Memory-Protein Ear Pads\n\n#### Bluetooth; cable for wired listening\n\n### What / Who It's Best For\n\n  * ![](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/wp-content/themes/worthit/assets/red-check.svg) People on a budget \n  * ![](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/wp-content/themes/worthit/assets/red-check.svg) People whose No. 1 priority is comfort \n  * ![](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/wp-content/themes/worthit/assets/red-check.svg) Casual music listeners \n\n###  Why We Love It\n\nWe at BuzzFeed pay attention when we hear about an impressive Amazon rating \u2014\nin fact, it\u2019s the basis of one of our most popular\n[series](https://www.buzzfeed.com/adriannalicitra/products-with-\nover-1000-reviews-on-amazon-june-19-licitra) \u2014 so when the Mpow 059 came onto\nour radar, we couldn\u2019t just tune it out. Not only does this pair of headphones\nhave almost 15,000 reviews, but it has an average 4.5-star rating and has been\nvetted by [Fakespot](https://www.fakespot.com/), a site that detects deception\nacross all Amazon reviews. (No foul play here, folks.)\n\n![Best Wireless Headphones Mpow standing up](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-\nit/staging/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/29164549/best-headphones-mpow-\nstanding.jpg)\n\nThe Mpow 059s aren\u2019t exactly critical darlings of the gadget world, but\nthey\u2019re well-loved by customers \u2014 and for a pretty good reason! We\u2019re happy to\nreport that these headphones match (and, in some cases, outperform) many of\ntheir more expensive rivals in the budget category, like the [Sony MDR-\nZX220s](http://linksynergy.walmart.com/fs-\nbin/click?id=yPKHhJU2qBg&subid=0&offerid=574499.1&type=10&tmpid=1082&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FBeats-\nSolo3-Wireless-On-Ear-Headphones%252F54594384&u1=BFReviewsWireHeadphones7-26)\n($78) and the [Jabra\nMove](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MR9CLWC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=bfreviewsite-20&linkId=e665f53662dee901357075da7f939a0b)\n($69.33). While both of those pairs provide eight hours of battery life (well\nbelow industry standard), the Mpows charge ahead with 20-plus hours (up from\n13-15 with a recent upgrade in 2017). Their more comparable budget headphone,\nthe well-reviewed [Creative Sound Blaster Jam Ultra-\nLight](https://amzn.to/2wkyoM5) ($37.99), by comparison, only has 12 hours\ncharge.\n\nWe were also pleasantly surprised by how comfortable these cups were. We were\neven more surprised that they remained comfortable after extended use \u2014\nespecially after reading a \u201cgentle reminder\u201d from Mpow on the Amazon listing,\nexplaining that buyers should plan to remove their headphones every one to two\nhours to allow their ears to \u201crelax.\u201d\n\n![Mpow 059 Bluetooth Wireless Headphones On Ears\n](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-it/staging/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/04/23195230/Mpow-059-In-Use-Best-Wireless-Headphones-\nOver-Ear1.jpg)\n\nNeedless to say, that was not our experience. \u201cGood luck prying these from\nanything but my cold dead body,\u201d said one tester when the process was done.\n(Editor\u2019s note: She was not actually dead.) We believe the Mpow 059\u2019s\ncomfortable fit is owed in no small part to their soft, memory-protein ear\ncups with an easy, just-snug-enough design. But this fit presents its own set\nof challenges: Runners and gym-goers, for example, will find that the slippage\nand lack of breathability on these ear cups make them a far-from-ideal-\nperformance headphone.\n\nThe sound quality on these headphones is by no means perfect either, and\nthat\u2019s to be expected when shopping for a pair at this price point. But if\nyou\u2019re looking for an upgrade from your wired buds, perhaps to use on your\nwork commute or next cross-country flight, these will certainly feel like one.\nWe should also underscore that these are passive (rather than active) noise\ncancellers, which means it is the physical design of the ear cups that\u2019s\nblocking out ambient noises \u2014 not a built-in technology like you might find\non, say, the industry-leading [Bose QuietComforts](https://amzn.to/2o5VSRK)\n(our $$$ pick). All things considered, the Mpow 059s deliver a pretty\nbalanced, if not slightly bass-heavy, sound for the price.\n\n![Best Wireless Headphones Mpow folded](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-\nit/staging/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/29164655/best-headphones-mpow-\nfolded.jpg)\n\nIf you can get past their somewhat hefty appearance (think: [Beats\nSolo3](https://amzn.to/2MNbNSI) but more in-your-face), there is a consolation\nprize in that the Mpow 059s fold up into a travel-friendly size that can be\neasily tucked inside their accompanying bag. And, if you\u2019d rather not bring\nunnecessary attention to your headphones with a flashy red or green, there are\nseven colorways to choose from (including three black/gray variations).\n\nThe bottom line: It\u2019s hard to find a jack-of-all-trades in the budget\nheadphone category. You will probably end up sacrificing comfort, sound, or\nappearance. The Mpow 059s pass most of \u2014 or all of \u2014 these categories,\ndepending on your personal affinity for larger-than-average, glossy earwear.\nAnd we don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find anything better for less.\n\n### User Reviews\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n> \u201cThese Mpow Bluetooth headphones deliver in what they said this device\n> would.

As in the brand beloved by middle-school emo kids? Yep!\nLet\u2019s just say Skullcandy took a couple years to find itself (probably not\nunlike you!), and the Venues represent the closest thing to the brand growing\nup.\n\nFirst, allow us to put the price into perspective. Even at nearly half the\nasking price of the Beats Solo 3s (our $$$ pick), the Venues outperform Dre in\nthe noise-cancellation arena. The Solo 3s offer passive noise isolation while\nthe Venues offer full-blown active noise-cancelling technology. Whereas Beats\nblock out sound only by the materials they\u2019re made from, the Venues, like all\nactive noise-cancelling headphones, monitor unwanted noise and add inverse\nfrequencies to \u201ccancel\u201d them. Our testers agreed the Venues\u2019 ANC was solid for\nblocking out ambient sound, with the minor gripe that you can hear a low hiss\nwhen switching to ANC mode. Easy fix: Just play something and you\u2019ll hardly\nnotice it.\n\n![Best Wireless Headphones Skullcandy liltle\nlogo](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-it/staging/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/07/29164815/best-headphones-skull-candy-little-logo.jpg)\n\nAfraid you\u2019ll be seen in public with that aggressive skull logo? No worries,\npassersby will have to squint pretty hard. Luckily, Skullcandy went subtle \u2014\n__ dare we say tasteful? \u2014 with a small decal along the Venues\u2019 matte black\nheadband. Hold us, our baby has finally flown the coop.\n\nLike the Plantronics BackBeat Pro 2s, which slightly edged out Skullcandy for\n[our favorite $$ noise-cancelling\nheadphones](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones/), the Venues allow for easy toggling. By hitting the \u201cANC\u201d button\nwhile listening to music, you\u2019ll allow noises from the outside world back in\nwithout having to entirely remove your headphones each time you want to engage\nin conversation with someone.\n\n![Best Wireless Headphones Skullcandy with\nhand](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-it/staging/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/07/29164834/best-headphones-skullcandy-with-hand.jpg)\n\nThe strength of the sound may come as a surprise to anyone whose primary\nassociation with the brand are those tinny-sounding buds from yesteryear. With\na range of genres, the Venues deliver crisp and balanced sound. Coupled with\nits ease of Bluetooth-pairing (we had very little issue connecting or\nmaintaining a connection), the Venues are a perfect match for folks of all\nages looking to dip their toes into wireless listening.\n\nComfort always feels like the most contentious topic when evaluating wireless\nheadphones, and the Venues were no exception. While there are a range of\nfactors that influence comfort \u2014 like whether you wear earrings or glasses, or\nwhether your ears are small, average, or large \u2014 the general consensus here is\nthat the Venues fit pretty snuggly. This fit won\u2019t be for everyone, but others\nwill swear by them for long-distance flights, which the Venues were made for,\nthanks to their 24-hour battery life and rapid charge (just 10 minutes of\ncharging will give you five hours of battery life). Now if only they collapsed\ndown for easier transport.\n\n![Best Wireless Headphones Skullcandy\ncontrols](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-it/staging/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/07/29164850/best-headphones-skullcandy-controls.jpg)\n\nThe winner of the best feature you didn\u2019t know you needed?

Using the accompanying mobile app, Venue\nowners can locate the exact whereabouts of their misplaced headphones \u2014 a\ngame-changer for scatterbrains who have been down this (Tile-less) road one\ntwo many times before.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true the Venues will not offer Bose-level (that is to say, best-in-\nclass) ANC, their Bose-influenced build, clear and balanced sound, and Tile\nintegration might be just enough for where you are in your music-listening\njourney. And it sure doesn\u2019t hurt any that they\u2019re a fraction of the price.\n\n### User Reviews\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n> \u201cI played several different styles of music through these, from heavy metal\n> to classical, and in each case the sound quality was fantastic.

(If that is your main\npriority, might we redirect you to [our review on the best noise-cancelling\nheadphones?](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones/)) But do we believe they are all-around the best fit for the most\namount of casual everyday listeners? Without a doubt.\n\nThat said, the Beats Solo3s have been known to fluctuate wildly in price; if\nyou have reservations about throwing down an amount of money that is roughly\nin line with more sound-forward, audiophile favorites like the [Bowers &\nWilkins P5](https://www.amazon.com/P5-Wireless-Bowers-Wilkins-\nBlack/dp/B00Y0Q9LFU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=bfreviewsite-20&linkId=bd5f0abd72f7582c5671f479a629a18f),\ndo note that prices dropped as low as $197 through retailers like Amazon and\nWalmart in 2018. At under $200, we had no hesitation in calling these the best\nmiddle-tier headphones available, no questions asked.\n\n![Beats Solo3 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones on\nhead](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-it/staging/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/04/23195348/Beats-Solo3-In-Use-Best-Wireless-Headphones-\nOver-Ear-Bluetooth.jpg)\n\nEven when marked at its notably higher retail price, we\u2019re still putting our\nfull weight behind them. Here\u2019s why: The Solo3s are intuitive! Their unfussy\ndesign caters squarely to casual listeners, not those with a wealth of\nBluetooth experience. There is only one button to press on the entire\nheadphone, which powers on (or off) your Bluetooth when pressed for three\nseconds, so the likelihood of messing this up is slim. That same button\nprompts a series of LED lights to illuminate, indicating exactly how much\nbattery life is left.\n\nAnd, hooboy, about that battery life. The Solo3s have made vast improvements\nin this space \u2014 tacking 28 additional hours onto the 12-hour bandwidth of the\n[Solo2s](https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Solo2-Wireless-Ear-\nHeadphone/dp/B00OVBXJ5M) for a total of 40 hours. This means that it\u2019s\nentirely possible for a casual listener \u2014 who uses their headphones for no\nmore than five to six hours a day \u2014 to go a full week without a single\nrecharge. If you _do_ happen to burn through those 40 hours in less than a\nweek and, inconveniently, don\u2019t catch that low battery until you\u2019re zipping\nout the door for work, there\u2019s Apple\u2019s patented \u201cFast Fuel\u201d to save your butt.\nFor the uninitiated, Fast Fuel works by giving you (the pressed-for-time\nindividual in this scenario) three hours of playback from just a quick five-\nminute charge. This is the cherry on top of the sundae, a cherry that you\nmight never even need to touch, because, to reiterate, 40 hours is _a lot_ of\nhours.\n\n![Best Wireless Headphones Beats with case](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-\nit/staging/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/29165331/best-headphones-beats-case.jpg)\n\nLet it also be known that, for a pair of on-ear headphones, the Solo3s are\nexceptionally comfortable \u2014 granted, a few of our testers found them to be a\nlittle _too_ snug and reported that their initial comfort gave way to mild\ndiscomfort after extended use (this was especially true of testers who wore\nthem with glasses). That said, we believe that their snugness is somewhat of a\nblessing in disguise: For runners and gym-goers, the Solo3s are that rare\nunicorn of an over-ear headphone that can double as a performance pair. They\nwon\u2019t slip during a workout because of this fit, and they can withstand a\npretty heavy sweat, despite not technically being \u201cwaterproof.\u201d That\u2019s money\nsaved on an additional pair of athletic headphones.\n\n![Best Wireless Headphones Beats folded](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-\nit/staging/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/29165408/best-headphones-beats-\nfolded.jpg)\n\nBottom line **:** The Solo3s are built with the largest number of people in\nmind, and they seamlessly transition from commuter to athletic to workplace\nheadphone. Their compact and sleek design \u2014 paired with a more-than-reasonable\nreduced price tag \u2014 makes these the middle-tier headphone to _beat_.\n\n### User Reviews\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n> \u201cI love these things. First, I was looking for something with the W1 chip to\n> easily sync/switch between my iPhone, Apple Watch, iPod, iPad, etc. It's\n> flawless. I also have them synced to my Windows 10 laptop. If that's on, it\n> takes priority over the other connections, so I just flip the Bluetooth on\n> the laptop on or off (it's a toggle function button on mine) and it works\n> great for that as well. This alone is awesome for my use. The battery life\n> is just ridiculous. Forty hours? I've played about 20 hours of music since\n> last charge and am just above 50-percent battery. That is crazy. And,\n> finally, the wireless range IS INSANE. I can leave my phone in the bedroom,\n> be across the house (75ft+) through three interior walls and an exterior\n> wall, and these don't skip a beat.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Big Dutch [From Amazon](https://amzn.to/2PsgL61)\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n> \u201cAfter several weeks of researching, comparing, and reading reviews, we\n> bought the Beats Solo3s. I originally wanted the Bose QuietComfort 35s or\n> the Beats Studios. I tried them on, tested them out in-store, and was having\n> a hard time deciding. I saw a pair of th Solo3s and tried them on (not sure\n> how I\u2019d feel about the on-ear versus the over-ear style). I was amazed that\n> the Solo3 sounded just as great as the Bose (in my opinion). While not\n> offering noise-canceling, I could still hear most things around me with the\n> Bose and Beats Studios. I felt the sound quality was just as good and I\n> could hear just as much noise with the Solo3\u2019s as the other two with noise-\n> canceling. So we bought two and have had them for two weeks now and traveled\n> with them. We are extremely happy with them and would buy them again!\u201d\n\n\u2014 T R [From Amazon](https://amzn.to/2NdBU2c)\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n> \u201cAmazing headphones. I use them to do transcription and I am able to hear\n> every single word without the strain or difficulties I had with previous\n> headphones. The color is gorgeous and I love that it came with a case,\n> cords, and even a clip to put on the bag for when I'm traveling. The soft\n> inner cushions for the ears are superb and very comfortable. I was worried\n> that the white would be difficult to keep clean or would not look good but\n> once I received them I saw that this would not be an issue. Controls on the\n> headset are very easy to use, quick to connect to computer, laptop, or\n> cellphone, and the sound quality is superb. I am very pleased with these\n> amazing headphones and they truly are worth the splurge.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Vicereine [From Amazon](https://amzn.to/2o3M22A)\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n> \u201cBeats Solo3 is not the best audio out there, but the crazy thing is that I\n> find myself wearing them more often than another $500 pair of headphones\n> that I have just because they are so convenient and easy. They fold up small\n> and are easy to carry in a backpack, holding up well to pretty tough\n> treatment. The battery lasts forever, and if it does die, you can get a\n> whole study session of juice for like five minutes of charging. Connecting\n> to my MacBook, iPhone, or iPad is so easy using the M1 chip, and the syncing\n> of settings through iCloud that it makes connecting other Bluetooth devices\n> seem super cumbersome: Just turn the Solo3 and choose it from your list of\n> devices (no need to disconnect from one device before connecting to the\n> next). And finally, they look good and are very comfortable.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jacob and Kiki Hantla [From Amazon](https://amzn.to/2MNE0Jd)\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n> \u201cI\u2019m very active and cannot wear those tiny earbuds (my ears are small and\n> they just don\u2019t fit right).
