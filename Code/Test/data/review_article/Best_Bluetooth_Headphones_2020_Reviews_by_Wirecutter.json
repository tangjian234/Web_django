These over-ear\nheadphones are delightfully uncomplicated, with easy pairing and clear, simple\ncontrols. And they\u2019re versatile performers, offering great sound, clear calls,\nactive noise cancelling, long battery life, and water resistance.\n\n#### Our pick\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33081/155068/4/96430?merchant=Amazon)\n\n### [Jabra Elite\n85h](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33081/155068/4/96430?merchant=Amazon\n\"Jabra Elite 85h\")\n\n## [Great sound, great\ndesign](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33081/155068/4/96430?merchant=Amazon\n\"Great sound, great design\")\n\nThe Elite 85h over-ear Bluetooth headphones do nearly everything better than\nsimilarly priced competitors.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$250 from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33081/155068/4/96430?merchant=Amazon)\n\n[$230 from\nStaples](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33081/161049/4/96430?merchant=Staples)\n\nThe [Jabra Elite\n85h](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33081/155068/4/95990/?merchant=Amazon)\ndelivers everything you could want in a pair of Bluetooth headphones. These\nheadphones sound fantastic out of the box, and they\u2019re more intuitive to set\nup and use than most competitors thanks to the automatic Bluetooth pairing\nprocess and the large, easy-to-access controls. The battery life, rated at 36\nhours (with active noise cancellation engaged), is also longer than that of\nmany competitors, and the battery charges quickly, providing five hours of use\nafter only 15 minutes of plug-in time. The Elite 85h works with the Amazon,\nApple, and Google digital assistants, and the microphone quality is super\nclear for phone calls. The Elite 85h is water resistant, too, and protected by\na two-year warranty against damage from rain. The active noise cancellation\nisn\u2019t as effective as that of the [Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones\n700](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/32740/155577/4/102002/?merchant=Amazon)\n(check out our guide to the [best active noise-cancelling\nheadphones](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones/) for more info), but it does reduce enough noise to be useful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Budget pick\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/31105/151545/4/96433?merchant=Amazon)\n\n### [Jabra Move Style\nEdition](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/31105/151545/4/96433?merchant=Amazon\n\"Jabra Move Style Edition\")\n\n## [A great option under\n$100](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/31105/151545/4/96433?merchant=Amazon\n\"A great option under $100\")\n\nWhile most budget Bluetooth headphones fall short in some key way, the Jabra\nMove Style Edition succeeds in the important areas: sound quality, fit, and\nbattery life.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$100 from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/31105/151545/4/96433?merchant=Amazon)\n\nThe [Jabra Move Style\nEdition](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/31105/151545/4/87881/?merchant=Amazon)\non-ear headphones sound about 75 percent as good as many Bluetooth headphones\nthat cost four times as much, and they\u2019re great with phone calls, too. The\ncontrols are easy to understand and use, and the soft earpads, padded\nheadband, and swivel earcups offer a comfortable fit for most people. A recent\nupgrade has improved the battery life, which is now listed at 14 hours of\ntalk/listen time (compared with eight hours in the previous version) and 12\ndays of standby time, and the Move Style Edition will still function while\nit\u2019s charging. These headphones don\u2019t have active noise cancelling, but people\nwho don\u2019t need that feature can save a bunch of money with this model. This\npair isn\u2019t flashy, but it gets the job done surprisingly well for the price.\n\n#### Upgrade pick\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29663/149696/4/96431?merchant=Amazon)\n\n### [NAD Viso\nHP70](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29663/149696/4/96431?merchant=Amazon\n\"NAD Viso HP70\")\n\n## [The best sound\nquality](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29663/149696/4/96431?merchant=Amazon\n\"The best sound quality\")\n\nIf you want wireless headphones but refuse to compromise on sound quality,\nbuild, or comfort\u2014and you\u2019re willing to pay more\u2014these are your headphones.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$450 from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29663/149696/4/96431?merchant=Amazon)\n\n[$450 from\nNAD](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29663/151370/4/96431?merchant=NAD)\n\nThe [NAD Viso\nHP70](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29663/149696/4/85561/?merchant=Amazon)\nis the best-sounding set of Bluetooth headphones we\u2019ve heard. It\u2019s also one of\nthe most comfortable pairs, with a lightweight chassis and super-soft memory-\nfoam earpads that make it a joy to wear even for long periods of time. It\nincludes decent active noise cancelling, as well. The set has a sleek,\nminimalist look and easy-to-use controls. The 15-hour battery life is less\nthan we\u2019d like, but you can still get through a couple of workdays before\nneeding to recharge\u2014plus, you can use the headphones in wired mode. Although\nthe active noise cancelling isn\u2019t as good as that of [our active-noise-\ncancelling picks](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-\ncancelling-headphones/), it is still effective and better than that of the\nJabra Elite 85h, especially with airplane noise.

My articles have been featured in\nFast Company, Forbes, the Los Angeles Times, and Time, and on _Good Morning\nAmerica_ , the BBC World Service, and _NBC Nightly News_.\n\nThen there\u2019s our panel of experts, including: [Brent\nButterworth](http://brentbutterworth.com/), a Wirecutter AV writer with\ndecades of experience; John Higgins, a session musician, sound editor, and\noccasional Wirecutter writer with a music master\u2019s degree from the University\nof Southern California; and Geoff Morrison, AV editor at large for Wirecutter\nand writer for CNET, Forbes, and Sound & Vision, who has over a decade and a\nhalf of AV reviewing experience.\n\n## Who should get this\n\nBluetooth wireless headphones are for people who don\u2019t like to be tethered to\ntheir music devices and are willing to pay a little more for that freedom.\nThey\u2019re also for people who own smartphones that lack headphone jacks and who\nwould rather not deal with special adapters to attach a wired pair of\nheadphones. Bluetooth audio quality has come a long way, so although you\u2019ll\npay more money to get the same fidelity as with corded headphones, you should\nstill expect headphones in this category to sound comparable to [wired\nheadphones](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-150-over-ear-\nheadphones/) that cost less than $300.\n\nThis guide focuses on over-ear and on-ear headphones, which are obviously\nlarger and heavier than earbuds but also the preferred type for anyone who\ndoesn\u2019t like the feel of wearing in-ear headphones. If you\u2019re looking for our\ntake on Bluetooth earbuds, check out our [wireless\nearbuds](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-wireless-earbuds/)\nguide. Bear in mind that, with wireless earbuds, the battery won\u2019t last as\nlong and you\u2019ll likely pay more money to get similar or slightly inferior\nperformance compared with the picks in this review.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for a pair of headphones to use while working and\nyour tasks include a lot of video chatting, phone calls, or work with\ndictation software, you may want to consider an office headset with a boom\nmic. You can find wireless options, even a few that sound pretty good while\nplaying music. Check out [our office headset\nguide](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-usb-office-headset/) to\nlearn more.\n\nAlthough some of the headphones in this category offer active noise\ncancelling, their sound quality, comfort, and ease of use were our top\npriorities in evaluating them for this guide. As of now, no single headphone\nmodel offers both the best sound and the best active noise cancelling,\nalthough some come close. Unfortunately, that means you need to compromise a\nlittle in one area or the other. If noise cancellation is your top priority,\ncheck out our noise-cancelling headphones guide instead.\n\n  * [![The Best Noise-Cancelling Headphones](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/noise-cancelling-headphones-update-09-19-lowres-4283-120x80.jpg)](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-headphones/)\n\n### [The Best Noise-Cancelling\nHeadphones](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones/)\n\nWhether you prefer over-ear or in-ear noise-cancelling headphones, we have\nrecommendations to help bring peace to your next trip.\n\nOne last thing: Wireless Bluetooth headphones are great for watching movies on\nyour computer or mobile device, but not on televisions. Not every television\nis Bluetooth compatible, so unless you have a receiver that can pair with\nBluetooth headphones, you need a transmitter to get the sound from your TV to\nyour headphones, and only one person can listen at a time. Also, Bluetooth\ntransmission takes a few milliseconds, meaning there\u2019s a delay (\u201clatency\u201d)\nbetween the video and the sound. Generally the delay is pretty small, but you\nmight find the effect irritating. If you want to avoid this (or if you\u2019re\nbuying for a family that wants more than one person to be able to use\nheadphones), you\u2019ll need a purpose-built RF headphone setup, so check out our\n[guide to wireless TV\nheadphones](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-wireless-home-\ntheater-headphones/).\n\n## How we picked\n\n![An individual working on a laptop, surrounded by headphones, while testing\nthe best wireless bluetooth headphones.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/bluetooth-wireless-headphones-2019-lowres-\ntest1-120x80.jpg) Photo: Lauren Dragan\n\nOur quest for the best Bluetooth headphones always starts with research.\nFirst, we research more than 100 companies to see what they\u2019ve released since\nour last update. To date, we\u2019ve seriously considered more than 200 headphone\nmodels just for this guide. To help us narrow down the field a bit (even we\ncan\u2019t test everything), we read reviews, both by professionals on sites like\nCNET and InnerFidelity and by customers on retailer sites such as Amazon and\nCrutchfield. We take note of what people like and don\u2019t like as we look for\nmodels that meet what we think are the most important criteria for good\nwireless headphones.\n\n  *  **Fantastic sound quality and a comfortable fit:** These are, of course, our top two priorities. If something hurts to wear, you won\u2019t use it, and poor fit often affects sound quality. And nobody should have to pay for subpar sound quality. During our research, we eliminate any headphones with several poor professional reviews or consistently low owner reviews.\n  *  **Easy-to-use-and-understand controls:** Batting desperately at your headphones trying to pause a track or answer a call is frustrating. We dismiss any headphones that are confusing to use or too easy to trigger accidentally.\n  *  **Solid Bluetooth connection strength:** Repeated complaints of music cutting out or calls being dropped prompt a dismissal.\n  *  **Good voice-call quality:** Very important if you expect to use the headphones all day.\n  *  **A minimum eight to 10 hours of battery life, plus the ability to work while charging and/or passively via a cord:** A good pair of Bluetooth headphones should last a full workday at minimum, and you should still be able to use it while it\u2019s charging or with a cord. Otherwise, if your battery dies in the middle of something important, you could be out of luck.\n  *  **Legitimate customer support:** This is the kind of thing that doesn\u2019t seem to matter until you need it. We dismiss any headphones not backed by a company that we can actually contact and receive a reply from, as well as those from a company that has a large backlog of complaints. A lifetime warranty means nothing if you don\u2019t have anyone you can call or email for help.\n\nFor this round, we called in every model that met these criteria (and either\nhad positive reviews or was too new to have any feedback) for our expert panel\nto evaluate.\n\n## How we tested\n\nOur expert panelists considered the **sound quality, fit, ease of use, and\ncomfort** of each pair and ranked their top three picks. I then took those\nfavorites and tested the microphones over phone calls. I also checked the\nBluetooth signal strength by wandering a good distance away from my phone,\nputting it in a pocket or bag, walking outside, and going several rooms away.\n\nFinally, to make sure that the actual use time lined up with each\nmanufacturer\u2019s claims, we tested battery life by playing some music loud\nenough to drown out an air conditioner and timing how long each set of\nheadphones took to finally die. Once we wrapped up testing, we made our picks\nbased on overall performance and value.\n\n## Our pick: Jabra Elite 85h\n\n![The Jabra Elite 85h, our pick for best wireless bluetooth\nheadphones.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/bluetooth-wireless-\nheadphones-2019-lowres-6304-120x80.jpg) Photo: Rozette Rago\n\n#### Our pick\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33081/155068/4/96430?merchant=Amazon)\n\n### [Jabra Elite\n85h](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33081/155068/4/96430?merchant=Amazon\n\"Jabra Elite 85h\")\n\n## [Great sound, great\ndesign](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33081/155068/4/96430?merchant=Amazon\n\"Great sound, great design\")\n\nThe Elite 85h over-ear Bluetooth headphones do nearly everything better than\nsimilarly priced competitors.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$250 from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33081/155068/4/96430?merchant=Amazon)\n\n[$230 from\nStaples](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33081/161049/4/96430?merchant=Staples)\n\nThere is an elegant simplicity to the design of the [Jabra Elite\n85h](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33081/155068/4/95990/?merchant=Amazon)\nover-ear headphones, which may not sound like a big deal\u2014unless you\u2019re\nfamiliar with the myriad small annoyances present in most of the competition.\nWhereas other Bluetooth headphones can have confusing and fiddly buttons that\noften cause you to trigger the wrong task, the Elite 85h has straightforward\ncontrols and a painless pairing process across all device platforms. This pair\nworks with the Amazon, Apple, and Google digital assistants, too. The sound\nquality is great for both music and phone calls, the headphones fit\ncomfortably, and the set features a 36-hour battery life. Plus, you get\npassable noise cancellation and a two-year warranty against rain damage.\nOverall, the Jabra Elite 85h headphones embody ease of use, and they\u2019re just\nplain enjoyable to pick up and wear. And their reasonable price means you\nwon\u2019t be afraid to use them every day.\n\nAfter testing more than 200 Bluetooth headphones over the past four years,\nwe\u2019ve paired a lot of headphones with a lot of devices\u2014so for us to say we\nwere impressed by how quickly and easily the Elite 85h paired and connected\nwith all of our devices is a big deal. As soon as you unfold the headphones,\nthey power on. If they aren\u2019t yet tethered to a device via Bluetooth, they\nautomatically go into pairing mode, no need for you to press any buttons. If\npreviously paired devices are nearby, the 85h connects simultaneously to the\ntwo most recently used. This dual connection is especially helpful if, for\nexample, you are switching between listening to music on a computer and taking\ncalls on a phone; you don\u2019t need to go into your Bluetooth settings to swap\nthe connection manually. To power the headphones down, just fold them up\nagain. The simplicity of all this is wonderful.\n\nThe Elite 85h headphones feel well built, with fabric accents and soft memory-\nfoam padding. They just feel less plasticky than many similarly priced\ncompetitors. And if you get caught in the rain, no biggie, as they\u2019re backed\nby an uncommon two-year warranty against water and dust damage. So feel free\nto savor that emo moment of walking in a drizzle listening to The Cure without\nworrying about ruining your headphones.

Photo:\nRozette Rago\n\n1 of 2\n\nThe physical controls are uncomplicated and easy to use without looking at\nthem\u2014you don\u2019t have too many buttons to learn, plus they\u2019re large and\ndistinct-feeling. Unlike touch controls, which can suffer from interference\ndue to rain or sweat or accidentally trigger when you\u2019re adjusting the fit,\nthe Elite 85h\u2019s physical controls are water resistant, and you can brush them\nwith your hand without inadvertently messing with your music.\n\nThe headphones are lightweight and comfortable to wear for long periods of\ntime. If you wear glasses, you may find that the foam in the earpads doesn\u2019t\ncompletely seal around the arms of your specs, so isolation and noise\ncancellation may be mildly compromised. However, we thought that the foam was\nsoft enough that wearing glasses in conjunction with the Elite 85h for several\nhours wasn\u2019t especially uncomfortable.\n\nThe battery life is long, lasting 36 hours on a full charge with ANC activated\n(41 without). If you run out of juice, the Elite 85h features a quick-charge\nfunction, which means that you get five hours of listening time from a\n15-minute charge. The headphones also detect when you take them off and put\nthem back on, automatically pausing and resuming your music, which helps\nconserve battery life. Plus, they function while charging, although the\nincluded cable is a little short for this to be practical. You can also use\nthe pair in wired mode.\n\nAlthough the Elite 85h sounds great right out of the box, you can use the free\nJabra Sound+ app to alter the EQ to your personal preference. Overall the 85h\nsounded terrific, with nice clarity on consonants that didn\u2019t hiss or pierce\nin a fatiguing way, a lower frequency range that wasn\u2019t blurry or muffling on\nmale vocals or bass guitar, and a more three-dimensional depth of field. The\nsound quality remained consistent whether we were listening over Bluetooth or\ncorded, with ANC on or off.\n\n![The Jabra Elite 85h headphones shown folded into their carrying\ncase.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bluetooth-\nwireless-headphones-2019-lowres-6311-120x80.jpg) The headphones fold flat and\nfit nicely in the supplied carrying case. Photo: Rozette Rago\n\nOn phone calls, the Elite 85h sounds very clear, and its multiple microphones\nhelp to reduce background noise for your callers. They also feed you some of\nthe sound of your own voice when you\u2019re on a call, similar to how phone\nhandsets do, so you don\u2019t feel the instinctual need to speak louder for your\nconversation partner to hear you. When watching video, we found the latency to\nbe so small as to be imperceptible.\n\nIf you want to have an in-person conversation or need situational awareness so\nyou\u2019re not completely shut off from the world, the Elite 85h\u2019s hear-through\nfeature uses the internal microphones to feed the sound of your surroundings\ninto the headphones, similar to the function on the [Jabra Elite\n65t](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-wireless-earbuds/) or on\nour [active-noise-cancellation\npick](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones/), the [Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones\n700](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/32740/155577/4/102002/?merchant=Amazon).\nJabra does a nice job of balancing the sound of the world with your music in a\nway that\u2019s helpful and not overly harsh or artificial. You can toggle this on\nand off (as well as the ANC) with a dedicated button on the left earcup, or\nthrough the Jabra app.\n\nThe active noise cancellation is mild, dimming low-frequency noises but not\ncompletely eliminating them. However, if you find intense ANC to be\nuncomfortable (we call this phenomenon \u201c[eardrum\nsuck](https://www.soundstagesolo.com/index.php/features/178-eardrum-suck-the-\nmystery-solved)\u201d), you could see this relatively mild noise cancellation as a\ngood thing. Our sensitive panelists didn\u2019t experience the telltale pressure\nand eventual headache that they got from more aggressive over-ear headphones\nsuch as the [Bose QuietComfort 35 Series\nII](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/bose-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones/).\n\n## Flaws but not dealbreakers\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the active noise cancellation on the Jabra Elite 85h\ndoes reduce some lower frequencies a tad but isn\u2019t nearly as effective as what\nyou get from the [Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones\n700](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/32740/155577/4/102002/?merchant=Amazon).\nThis fact kept the Elite 85h from being our [noise-cancelling\npick](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones/). But not everyone prioritizes active noise cancellation (or even\nenjoys it), and we liked every other aspect of the Jabra so much that we were\nable to let this flaw slide.\n\nThe Jabra Sound+ app includes a few bonus features that seem nice but don\u2019t\nreally deliver. The Smart Active ANC turns ANC or situational awareness on\nbased on your surroundings. We gave it a trial run but found it less than\nuseful and ended up turning the feature off. Find My Jabra is designed to help\nyou find misplaced headphones, but the tracking applies only to where the\nheadphones were last powered on in proximity to the device with the app. If\nyou turn the headphones off and move them, for example, the map doesn\u2019t\nupdate. Plus, the mapping isn\u2019t room-by-room specific, so you\u2019ll know your\nmissing cans were last turned on somewhere in the building, but not\nspecifically where, or even if they\u2019re still around.\n\nAs with most wireless headphones we tested in this category, the included cord\ndoesn\u2019t have a remote or mic. However, Jabra\u2019s active noise cancelling will\nwork while you\u2019re listening via a cord, as will the headphones\u2019 volume\ncontrols, albeit independently of the device\u2014as a result, you\u2019ll probably\nprefer to turn your device\u2019s volume up all the way and then make volume\nchanges through the headphones.\n\n## Budget pick: Jabra Move Style Edition\n\n![The Jabra Move Style Edition wireless bluetooth headphones, our budget pick\nfor best wireless bluetooth headphones.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/bluetooth-wireless-\nheadphones-2019-lowres-8548-120x80.jpg) Photo: Rozette Rago\n\n#### Budget pick\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/31105/151545/4/96433?merchant=Amazon)\n\n### [Jabra Move Style\nEdition](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/31105/151545/4/96433?merchant=Amazon\n\"Jabra Move Style Edition\")\n\n## [A great option under\n$100](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/31105/151545/4/96433?merchant=Amazon\n\"A great option under $100\")\n\nWhile most budget Bluetooth headphones fall short in some key way, the Jabra\nMove Style Edition succeeds in the important areas: sound quality, fit, and\nbattery life.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$100 from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/31105/151545/4/96433?merchant=Amazon)\n\nThe [Jabra Move Style\nEdition](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/31105/151545/4/87881/?merchant=Amazon)\nis the best set of budget wireless Bluetooth headphones because it\u2019s great\nsounding, comfortable, equipped with easy-to-use controls, and affordably\npriced\u2014and it has solid battery life, too. Overall, we had to look to wireless\nheadphones that cost much more to find anything better. Whereas every other\nBluetooth headphone model under $200 falls short on at least one of our\ncriteria, the Move Style Edition covers the basics you need\u2014and it does so\nrather well. The on-ear design may not appeal to everyone, but for people who\nwear glasses, it can be more comfortable than over-ear headphones.\n\nThe Move Style Edition is the new and improved version of our original budget\npick, the [Jabra Move\nWireless](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/1695/4214/4/87882/?merchant=Amazon),\nwhich is now discontinued. Although the two sound the same, the Move Style\nEdition has slightly better battery life and upgraded padding in both the\nearcups and headband. The Move Style Edition has a claimed 14-hour battery\nlife, whereas the Move Wireless had a claimed battery life of eight hours,\nthough we got 15 in our test. These headphones started giving an alert that\nthe battery was low around the 14-hour mark, but they lasted 16 hours in our\ntests.\n\nWe found that the sound quality of the Move Style Edition was balanced in our\ntests, so all genres sounded great. The lower end of the frequencies was\ndefined, so electronic basslines didn\u2019t muddy up the sound and kick drums\navoided blurring or thudding. The refined bass meant mids were clear and\ndidn\u2019t get lost. Male voices sounded smooth and rich, and the lower range on\npiano had depth.\n\nAs for the highs, you\u2019ll find a touch of boost in the sibilant range, so you\nwill get a bit of extra \u201csss\u201d in consonants, but the effect is relatively\nminor compared with what we\u2019ve heard from a good number of the other Bluetooth\nheadphones in this price range. Overall, violin, flute, and female voices\nsounded clear and even. You won\u2019t quite get the sense of three-dimensional\nspace that the Jabra Elite 85h delivers, nor the detail of the NAD Viso HP70,\nbut those models cost significantly more. While testing, Geoff said,\n\u201cConsidering that the Jabra headphones sound as good as they do, some of these\ncompanies making $250-plus headphones should be ashamed of themselves.\u201d\n\n  * ![A close up of the padding on the headband featured in the Jabra Move Style Edition wireless bluetooth headphones.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bluetooth-wireless-headphones-2019-lowres-8555-200x134.jpg)\n\nThe new Move Style Edition features upgraded padding in the headband and\nearcups.

Photo: Rozette Rago\n\n1 of 2\n\nAll of our panelists found the Move Style Edition comfortable. Extra-soft\nearpads, a cloth-coated and padded headband, and a slight swivel to the\nearcups made this pair feel not only light and comfy but also sturdy and well\nmade, especially for under $100. Whereas the foam in the original Move\nWireless felt like the kind in an egg-crate mattress topper, the new foam is\nmore like a memory-foam mattress. Although the Move Style Edition headphones\ndon\u2019t block out as much noise as the over-ear earcups of the Elite 85h, the\non-ear design of this Move pair may be more comfortable for glasses wearers.\nThe clamping force of the headband and the pliable padding don\u2019t put too much\npressure on the ears, and the earcups stay clear of the arms of glasses.\n\nWhen you\u2019re wearing the Move Style Edition headphones, their rubberized\ncontrols are easy to find by touch. During our testing, trying to find the\ncontrols on many of the other designs was a frustratingly huge problem. The\nvolume-up and volume-down buttons on the Move Style Edition double as track\nforward and track back, and you can use the button between them to play,\npause, access voice commands, and take calls. The pair has a built-in\nmicrophone, and in our experience it sounded about as good on the other end of\nthe line as that of any other wireless headphones we\u2019ve tested.\n\nAnother basic, but somehow lacking, feature in many other wireless headphones\nwe\u2019ve tested is an on/off button. We know this sounds simplistic, but in many\ncases we\u2019ve found it frustrating to figure out whether the power is truly\noff\u2014when you want to be sure to save your battery life, knowing you\u2019ve powered\ndown is a big deal. The Jabra Move Style Edition has an easy-to-understand\ntoggle button that slides to the right to power off, to the center to power\non, and to the left to pair. Easy peasy.\n\n## Upgrade pick: NAD Viso HP70\n\n![The NAD HP70 bluetooth wireless\nheadphones.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/noise-\ncancelling-headphones-lowres-3430-120x80.jpg) Photo: Kyle Fitzgerald\n\n#### Upgrade pick\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29663/149696/4/96431?merchant=Amazon)\n\n### [NAD Viso\nHP70](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29663/149696/4/96431?merchant=Amazon\n\"NAD Viso HP70\")\n\n## [The best sound\nquality](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29663/149696/4/96431?merchant=Amazon\n\"The best sound quality\")\n\nIf you want wireless headphones but refuse to compromise on sound quality,\nbuild, or comfort\u2014and you\u2019re willing to pay more\u2014these are your headphones.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$450 from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29663/149696/4/96431?merchant=Amazon)\n\n[$450 from\nNAD](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29663/151370/4/96431?merchant=NAD)\n\nIf you\u2019re in pursuit of the absolute best-sounding pair of wireless\nheadphones\u2014and you\u2019re willing to pay more to get it\u2014check out the [NAD Viso\nHP70](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29663/149696/4/85561/?merchant=Amazon).\nOf all the Bluetooth headphones we\u2019ve tested, this pair is the most enjoyable\nto listen to thanks to its natural and more spacious sound. The luxurious-\nlooking stitched-leatherette headband and super-soft memory-foam earcups are\ncomfortable to wear, even for long periods of time. The controls are easy to\naccess and use, and the HP70 folds flat enough to be reasonably portable. The\nnoise cancelling is competitive but not as good as that of our [active-noise-\ncancelling picks](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-\ncancelling-headphones/), and the HP70 also has shorter battery life than the\nJabra Elite 85h, around 15 hours.\n\nThe main reason to buy this pair is the excellent and natural sound quality.\nAny kind of music is well served. In our tests, the HP70 delivered more\nclarity in the highs and sounded almost completely neutral\u2014but it produced\njust a tad extra bass, which one could argue is what adds a sense of three-\ndimensional space to music, especially live performances. A mild bump in the\nvocal range was just enough not to lose details, and it avoided a sibilant,\nicy, inauthentic tone. The HP70 features the aptX HD audio codec, which\naccording to [Bluetooth blind\ntests](http://www.brentbutterworth.com/bluetooth-blind-test.html) can subtly\nenhance sound quality if you use it with an aptX HD\u2013compatible media device.\n\n  * ![A close-up of the controls on the NAD HP70 bluetooth wireless headphones.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/noise-cancelling-headphones-lowres-3435-200x134.jpg)\n\nThe NAD headphones offer dedicated buttons for volume, ANC, and track control.\nPhoto: Kyle Fitzgerald\n\n  * ![A close-up of the ear padding on the NAD HP70 bluetooth wireless headphones.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/noise-cancelling-headphones-lowres-3436-200x134.jpg)\n\nThe NAD HP70 features super-soft memory-foam earcups that are comfortable to\nwear for long listening sessions.

Photo: Kyle Fitzgerald\n\n1 of 2\n\nLightweight and offering excellent padding, the HP70 is very comfortable to\nwear, which is especially important if you\u2019re on a long flight or you like to\nlisten to music through an entire workday. Everyone on our panel was happy\nwith the fit, despite our variety of head and ear sizes. The headphones feel\nwell made, and NAD covers the HP70 with a two-year warranty.\n\nWhen you fold the set flat into its leatherette soft-sided case, the profile\nis slender enough to fit into most laptop cases, which is helpful if you plan\nto take your headphones on the go. Unfortunately, as with every other model we\nrecommend here, the HP70\u2019s included cable has neither a remote nor a\nmicrophone\u2014so you can\u2019t take calls or toggle songs via remote if you run out\nof battery power. NAD does include dual-input flight adapters for jet-setters.\n\nThe claimed battery life is up to 15 hours with Bluetooth and noise cancelling\non. We got 15\u00bd hours in our tests, but your results may vary. Although the\nBluetooth range was a solid 30 feet line-of-sight with a Samsung Galaxy S9 in\nour testing, the call quality wasn\u2019t so hot\u2014voices sounded muddy to me, with\nsimilar results on the caller\u2019s end. It wasn\u2019t so bad that we couldn\u2019t\nunderstand each other, but it lacked the crispness of the phone calls we\u2019ve\ntaken on our top pick, the Jabra Elite 85h.\n\n![The NAD HP70 bluetooth wireless headphones shown in their soft leather\ncarrying case, from our review of the best bluetooth wireless\nheadphones.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/noise-\ncancelling-headphones-lowres-3444-120x80.jpg) The NAD HP70 package includes a\nsoft-sided leatherette case. Photo: Kyle Fitzgerald\n\nThe noise cancelling of the HP70 is effective but not the absolute best. You\ncan see how it compares with other ANC headphones in our [noise-cancelling\nheadphones guide](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-\ncancelling-headphones/). Although the noise cancelling isn\u2019t as good as on our\npicks, it does the trick for airplane noise. And unlike with the vast majority\nof ANC headphones we\u2019ve tested, on this pair the sound quality does not change\nwhether you listen with noise cancelling on or off, or if you listen passively\nvia a cable. That\u2019s a rare feat, which makes it clear that NAD spent some time\ncarefully tuning this pair.\n\n## A word on aptX\n\nReaders often ask if the Bluetooth headphones we pick support aptX. If you\u2019re\nunfamiliar with aptX, it\u2019s a method of encoding and compressing audio that,\nenthusiasts claim, offers better sound via Bluetooth. For aptX to work, both\nthe device sending the audio and the headphones receiving the audio have to\nsupport it, and that\u2019s often hit or miss: For example, a MacBook Pro supports\naptX, but no iPhones do. So before you consider whether aptX in headphones is\na factor worth exploring, find out if your [playback device even supports\nit](http://aptx.com/products/browse/categories).\n\nThere is some skepticism as to whether aptX encoding is even worth the effort.\nTesting panelist and Wirecutter writer Brent Butterworth wrote an [entire\narticle on the subject](https://www.lifewire.com/what-to-know-about-\nbluetooth-3134591). The verdict? It depends on the person. Brent made a [blind\ntest](http://www.brentbutterworth.com/bluetooth-blind-test.html) that you can\ntake yourself, comparing the sound quality of MP3, WAV, MP3 through SBC, and\nWAV through aptX and aptX HD. Generally speaking, most of us who took the test\nfound that the biggest difference depended on the quality of the original\nfile, not on the software that compressed it, but aptX HD does provide a\nmoderate benefit. We recommend that you give the test a try to see if you can\nhear the difference before you make a decision as to whether aptX is worth\nspending the extra money.\n\n## What to look forward to\n\nJabra announced the [Elite 45h](https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-\nheadsets/jabra-elite-45h), new on-ear Bluetooth headphones that will challenge\nour current budget Bluetooth headphone pick, the [Jabra\nMove](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/31105/151545/4/87881/?merchant=Amazon).\nThe Elite 45h will offer an impressive 40 hours of battery life, better\nmicrophones for phone calls, USB-C charging with quick charging, and\ncompatibility with Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, all for $100.\n\nPuro, maker of our favorite [volume-limiting headphones for\nkids](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-kids-headphones/), has\nannounced active noise-cancelling headphones with volume limiting for teens\nand adults. The Puro Pro set will have 28 hours of battery life with noise\ncancellation enabled and will have a maximum output of 85 dB (the OSHA-\nrecommended safer level). The Pro will be available this spring for $200.\n\nThe [JBL Club\n700BT](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/36603/159020/4/108958/?merchant=JBL)\nis a set of noise-isolating on-ear headphones with ambient awareness mode, a\nmassive 50 hours of battery life, and a dedicated bass boost button for $150.\nIt\u2019s also due this spring.\n\n## Other Bluetooth headphones we like\n\n[Anker\u2019s Soundcore Life\nQ20](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34362/156211/4/113458/?merchant=Amazon)\nheadphones, our budget pick in [Best Noise-Cancelling\nHeadphones](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones/#best-budget-over-ear-noise-cancelling-headphones-anker-soundcore-\nlife-q20), may lack the bells and whistles of some more expensive headphones,\nbut they deliver in the important areas. The noise cancellation is effective,\nthe sound quality is pretty decent (though a bit bass-heavy), and the\nlightweight chassis and soft foam ear cups are very comfortable. The 30-hour\nbattery life is impressive for a model in any price range. You can use them in\nwired mode, and the controls are easy to operate. Although the Life Q20\nheadphones don\u2019t come with EQ manipulation, adjustable ANC, touch controls, or\nalways-listening voice activation, this pair does deliver on the ANC-headphone\nessentials, and it offers a shocking amount of quality for well under $100.\nHowever, if you don\u2019t need noise cancellation, the Jabra Move feels more\nsubstantially built and has a much clearer and more balanced sound.\n\nThe [Beats Solo\nPro](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34872/156900/4/101553/?merchant=Apple)\nheadphones are worth considering if you wear glasses and need active noise\ncancellation. Because of its on-ear design, the Solo Pro pair doesn\u2019t rest on\nthe arms of your spectacles and pinch your noggin. The fit is very\ncomfortable, and thanks to the inclusion of Apple\u2019s H1 chip, the user\nexperience is very intuitive, especially for Apple users already familiar with\nthe AirPods\u2019s pairing process. Unfold the headphones to power them on, and a\nSolo Pro pop-up appears on your iPhone. The Solo Pro\u2019s transparency mode is\nhelpful for situational awareness when you need to have a conversation, and it\nisn\u2019t brash or tinny-sounding, like many other pass-through audio interfaces\nwe\u2019ve tested. Although these headphones aren\u2019t as good at noise cancelling as\nthe Bose 700, the Solo Pro\u2019s adaptive ANC does a respectable job of reducing\nthe important airplane hum sounds, so you can enjoy your music at lower\nvolumes. The sound quality is pretty great, though there is extra bass\nintensity that\u2019s a little less refined than we prefer.\n\n[Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones\n700](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/32740/155577/4/98201/?merchant=Amazon):\nBose is the undeniable master of active noise cancellation, and the new 700\nheadphones are [the best we\u2019ve tested at reducing\nnoise](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones/). If noise cancellation is your top priority, these are the\nheadphones to get. Plus, they\u2019re lightweight, equipped with a long battery\nlife and easy-to-use controls, and compatible with the Google, Apple, and\nAmazon Alexa voice assistants. However, if you are prone to what we call\n\u201c[eardrum suck](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/how-do-noise-\ncancelling-headphones-work/),\u201d the highest ANC setting will absolutely affect\nyou. Thankfully, the 700 pair has a dial that allows you to select a lower\nlevel of noise cancellation; our panelists, who are prone to the eardrum suck\nsensation, found that the 5 setting was where they were able to listen at\nlength comfortably. But at that point, the ANC had about the same efficacy as\nthat of other, less-expensive headphones.\n\n[JBL Live\n650BTNC](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/31766/152587/4/95992/?merchant=JBL):\nThis pair falls through the cracks of our picks lineup for several reasons\u2014its\nactive noise cancellation isn\u2019t as effective as that of the Sony WH-H900N, it\ndoesn\u2019t sound as good as the Jabra Elite 85h, and it isn\u2019t as inexpensive as\nthe Jabra Move Style Edition. But if you want something that fits in between\nthe Move Style Edition and the WH-H900N or Elite 85h in performance and price,\nthis set fits the bill. In our tests, the sound was pleasant (balanced but\nlacking the clarity and low-end definition of pricier models), the ANC was\npassable, and the fit was comfortable. Plus, the included cable has a remote\nand mic, which is rare. These headphones are highly recommendable, especially\nfor the price.\n\n[Urbanears\nPampas](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33231/154710/4/95993/?merchant=Urbanears):\nOur panel loved the simplicity of the single toggle-button control, the\ncomfortable and lightweight design, and the 30-hour battery life. These\nheadphones are more of a bass lover\u2019s choice, however, as the bass in our\ntests was notably boosted. Although we could still clearly hear male vocals,\nand the low notes didn\u2019t blur or smear, deep bass notes were very loud in the\nmix, especially with hip-hop and EDM. If you like that kind of sound profile,\nyou\u2019ll love these headphones.\n\n## The competition\n\nWe\u2019ve tested more than 200 headphones for this guide, which is a lot to\ndigest, so we\u2019re sharing our thoughts on only the most notable competitors\nhere. However, if there is a specific model you\u2019re curious about, reach out to\nour team via Twitter (@wirecutter) or email (notes@wirecutter.com), and we\u2019ll\nbe happy to help. If you\u2019re looking specifically for over-ear headphones with\nactive noise cancelling, check out our Best Noise-Cancelling Headphones guide\nfor more options.\n\n[AKG\nK371-BT](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/36605/159022/4/113380/?merchant=AKG):\nThe wired version of this pair has gained favor among the audiophile set, as\nit measures very closely to the [Harman\ncurve](https://www.innerfidelity.com/content/harman-tweaks-its-headphone-\ntarget-response), which many regard as the standard for headphones that are\nperceptually neutral. In other words, they are great for monitoring\nrecordings. So we were very excited at the prospect of a wireless version.\nUnfortunately, the K371-BT does not sound the same as the original K371. Both\ncorded and wireless, this pair has noticeably less bass response, which leaves\nthe K371-BT feeling like it\u2019s lacking a foundation. Additionally, the touch\ncontrols are finicky (we often adjusted volume when trying to play/pause), and\nthe microphone is very quiet, so you\u2019ll need to speak a little louder on phone\ncalls than you might with headphones that have a more sensitive mic. The\noblong-shaped earcups may make it difficult to get a seal for folks with\nsmaller head sizes. And the input on the BT version utilizes a 4-pin mini XLR\nconnection rather than the more standard 3-pin mini XLR plug on the\noriginal\u2013which may make finding replacement cables more difficult.\n\n[Audio-Technica\nATH-M50xBT](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/30352/150562/4/85577/?merchant=Amazon):\nThis is the Bluetooth version of Audio-Technica\u2019s popular studio headphones,\nand the two models sound very similar. If you like the wired version, you\u2019ll\nlike this set. Our panel found that the bass had a tendency to blur the mids,\nso male vocals got muddled. The highs were slightly edgy but not so sibilant\nthat it was fatiguing\u2014they were just a bit more forward on \u201cs\u201d sounds or\ncymbal hits than was natural.\n\n[Bang & Olufsen Beoplay\nH8i](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/25545/135387/4/72833/?merchant=Amazon):\nThe biggest flaw of the H8i was the very intense and fatiguing peak in the\nhigh-frequency range, as \u201cs\u201d sounds and cymbals were piercing and could become\nuncomfortable at moderate volumes. Unfortunately, the EQ settings on the\nincluded app didn\u2019t address the problem without negatively impacting the\noverall sound quality. Although the active noise cancelling was a little\nbetter than average and the H8i is beautifully built, we\u2019d like a more\nbalanced and accurate sound profile.\n\n[Bang & Olufsen Beoplay\nH9i](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/25546/135395/4/72832/?merchant=Amazon):\nOn the H9i, the touch controls are finicky, which can be annoying especially\nwhen you\u2019re trying to turn down the volume on a too-loud track and the\nheadphones won\u2019t respond. The active noise cancelling was decent but not the\nmost effective we\u2019ve encountered. As for sound quality, a dip in the lower-mid\nfrequencies made for an unnatural sound quality, and bass guitars got lost.\nThis pair wasn\u2019t as clear and accurate as we\u2019d like to see at this price.\n\n[Beats\nSolo3](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/19603/105136/4/45856/?merchant=Amazon):\nThe W1 chip makes pairing with Apple devices a breeze, and the 40-hour battery\nlife is impressive. The sound was very similar to that of the Solo2, which we\nalso liked, offering nice highs and mids with a slight bass boost. But the\nSolo3 currently costs too darn much for what you get. At $150, it could be a\npick.\n\n[Beyerdynamic Aventho\nWireless](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/25547/135403/4/72831/?merchant=Amazon):\nThis pair sounded really good right out of the box; the bass was a smidgen\nbloated, so low notes or kick drums could lack definition on attack and decay.\nThe chassis is made of high-quality materials that are a little heavy but\nbalanced, with not too much clamping force. Like many on-ear headphones, this\nset can make your outer ears ache somewhat after a long period of listening.\nThe controls are swipe-touch style and work intuitively. What sets the Aventho\napart is the built-in hearing test, designed by Mimi. However, these kinds of\nheadphones aren\u2019t regulated by the FDA; if you think you have hearing damage,\nwe recommend checking with an audiologist before using any hearing-\naugmentation headphones.\n\n[Beyerdynamic Lagoon ANC\nTraveller](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33230/154709/4/98202/?merchant=Beyerdynamic):\nThese headphones have a lot of positive attributes. They look attractive, the\nnoise cancellation is decent, and the sound is of the quality that you might\nexpect from Beyerdynamic. However, at this pair\u2019s $400 price, some of its\nminor flaws become bigger issues. The headband is too big for smaller head\nsizes, the set had a lack of vocal feedback during our test calls, and the\nsound, while admirable, came across as a bit bloated in the low end and\nlacking in high-end detail. Beyerdynamic offers a hearing-test-based EQ system\nthat adjusts the sound for you, but we\u2019re reluctant to recommend hearing\ncompensation outside of a doctor\u2019s advice. (Brent Butterworth, in a [review\nfor SoundStage\nSolo](https://www.soundstagesolo.com/index.php/equipment/headphones/204-beyerdynamic-\nlagoon-anc-bluetooth-headphones), agrees.) Overall, they\u2019re good headphones in\na very competitive category.\n\n[Bose QuietComfort 35 Series\nII](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/23486/126483/4/85563?merchant=Amazon):\nThe QC35 headphones offer some of the best noise cancellation you can get. But\nyou pay a premium for that, and some people may find the aggressive ANC\nuncomfortable. For details, you can [read more about these\nheadphones](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/bose-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones/).\n\n[Bowers & Wilkins\nPX](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/23472/126375/4/68143/?merchant=Amazon):\nThese headphones are beautiful to look at but have too many problems. With the\nANC activated in our tests, the sound was bizarrely tuned. Acoustic guitar\nsounded boxy and hollow, as though someone had tried to add ambient room EQ to\na mix. Bass notes had a reverby quality that muffled male vocals. With the ANC\noff, the sound was even worse. Plus, the PX set\u2019s auto-pause function is too\nsensitive: While I was typing my notes and looking down at my laptop, the PX\nkept pausing my music.\n\n[Cleer\nEnduro](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34873/156901/4/104506/?merchant=Cleer):\nThe claimed 100 hours of battery life per charge is incredibly impressive. But\nthe controls are tricky to operate by feel, and the sound quality is sadly\nmarred by a blurry bass that makes male vocals sound far away.\n\n[Cleer Flow\nII](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34367/157721/4/113459/?merchant=Amazon):\nWe have nothing overly negative to say about the Flow II. The noise\ncancellation is middle of the road, but it\u2019s effective enough to reduce air-\nconditioner hum or airplane noise. We thought there wasn\u2019t enough bass, and\nthe ear cups could be a bit large for those with smaller heads. If you like a\nbrighter sound profile and prefer less intense ANC, they\u2019re recommendable.\n\n[Earfun\nWave](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/35822/158056/4/104507/?merchant=Amazon):\nEarfun is a newer company that has had some impressive results with its first\nofferings. The Wave headphones are only $50, which is why we were surprised\nthat they were so comfortable and that the sound quality, though bass-heavy\nwith treble that could be piercing, rivaled that of some headphones that cost\ntwice as much. However, they aren\u2019t a pick because we\u2019ve encountered some\ninconsistencies in their manufacturing quality, and since Earfun is so very\nnew, we want to be sure the customer service is good and that the company will\nbe around for the long haul.\n\n[Heyday Wireless On-Ear\nHeadphones](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/30357/150567/4/85581/?merchant=Target):\nThis set sold under Target\u2019s house-brand name is built really well and easy to\npair, but the fit can be too big and loose on smaller heads. In our tests, the\nsound was boomy, with blurry bass and lackluster detail on strings and snare\nhits. We\u2019ve heard worse but we\u2019ve also heard way better.\n\n[House of Marley\nExodus](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33232/154711/4/95994/?merchant=House%20of%20Marley):\nWe love the sustainable design and the company ethics, but the sound quality?\nNot as much. Although the Exodus is comfortable to wear and has easy-to-use\ncontrols and a cool look, in our tests the bass was super blurry and made male\nvocals sound as if they were coming from under a comforter.\n\n[House of Marley Positive Vibration\nXL](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/35823/158057/4/104508/?merchant=House%20of%20Marley):\nThese are the best-sounding headphones that House of Marley has released in a\nlong time. They have a solid and sustainable build quality, and though the\nsound is bass-heavy, it\u2019s not overpowering. The highs are a tad coarse when\ncompared with the Jabra Move, but at under $100, that could be forgivable if\nyou like the looks. One caveat: People with smaller noggins may want to look\nelsewhere, since the headband is on the longer side. I had to hold these\nheadphones up about an inch to have them fit properly.\n\n[Marshall Mid\nANC](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/25757/140077/4/85583/?merchant=Amazon):\nThis pair isn\u2019t half bad, with a comfortable, light design, easy-to-operate\ncontrols, and a fun, bass-forward sound. What\u2019s crazy is that this pair folds\nup to be rather small, yet the clunky carrying case makes it far more unwieldy\nto pack than it needs to be. The ANC is only okay but capable of reducing\nlower-frequency airplane noises. If you like the looks and the on-ear fit,\nit\u2019s a fine alternative to our picks.\n\n[Master & Dynamic MH40\nWireless](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/35826/158060/4/104509/?merchant=Master%20%26%20Dynamic):\nThe MH40 weighs less than the other members of the M&D family, which is a nice\nsurprise. The looks are still pretty, but we wish the controls were easier to\nuse by feel. The sound is good, but the bass is a bit loud in the mix, with a\nboost that extends into the mids and causes male vocals to sound somewhat\nveiled and bass guitar to feel unnaturally loud in the mix. Because of this\npair\u2019s price tag, these flaws are hard to overlook.\n\n[Master & Dynamic\nMW60](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/19628/105242/4/45893/?merchant=Master%20%26%20Dynamic):\nBeautiful but heavy, the MW60 is a luxury headphone model in looks and price.\nThe sound was great but ever-so-slightly flawed: The boost on the lows\nextended slightly into the lower mids, so the sound had a subtly veiled\nquality that took some of the vitality out of live music. That\u2019s an\nexceptionally minor quibble, but when you\u2019re paying $400 and you don\u2019t get any\nbonus features like active noise cancelling, we insist upon the best sound\nquality. If you love the aesthetic and have the cash to throw around, the MW60\nis somewhat more form than function, but it\u2019s still a lovely pair of\nheadphones.\n\n[Master & Dynamic\nMW65](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34371/156222/4/113460/?merchant=Master%20%26%20Dynamic):\nIf you don\u2019t mind paying a higher price, the MW65 is a decent choice. The\nproblem is that the design is the only way in which these headphones are\nsuperlative. The ANC was middling, we found them a little heavy to wear, they\ndidn\u2019t seal out external sounds too well, and the sound, though quite nice,\nwas a bit unnaturally boosted in the lows and highs. If these headphones\nweren\u2019t $500, we could overlook all of those concerns, but at that price, we\nwant something closer to perfection.\n\n[Microsoft Surface\nHeadphones](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/30347/150557/4/85566/?merchant=Amazon):\nThis set is great if you frequently use Cortana, but as CNET notes, the [sound\nand battery life are meh](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-\nheadphones-review/) for the price.\n\n[Plantronics BackBeat Fit\n500](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/25031/133304/4/87884/?merchant=Amazon):\nThis is the first Bluetooth pair of on-ear workout headphones we\u2019ve liked, and\nit\u2019s our [workout pick for\nweightlifters](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-workout-\nheadphones/) because it fits comfortably but stays put, remains sweat\nresistant, and is easy to keep clean. The simple-to-use controls allow you to\nchange tracks, adjust volume, take calls, and access your phone\u2019s digital\nassistant without taking the BackBeat Fit 500 off your noggin. These\nheadphones also have a fun, bass-forward sound and an 18-hour battery life.\nHowever, their sound quality isn\u2019t as good, nor is their padding as plush as\nthe Jabra Move pair\u2019s.\n\n[Plantronics BackBeat Go\n810](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/28408/147547/4/85595/?merchant=Amazon):\nOur panelists split on this affordably priced model versus our [noise-\ncancelling budget pick](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-\ncancelling-headphones/), the Anker Soundcore Space NC. We adored the\nlightweight, comfy design, but we found the bass notes to be a little blobby,\nand we all wished the active noise cancelling were a little more effective. In\nthe end, competitors with lower prices or better noise cancelling and sound\nedged out this pair.\n\n[Samsung AKG\nY500](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/30348/150558/4/85570/?merchant=Samsung):\nThe controls were not the most intuitive, and the fit could pinch even smaller\nheads. The sound was only okay, as female vocals sounded recessed and the bass\nwas too forward in the mix. The auto pause and play when you take these\nheadphones off (and put them back on) is neat, though.\n\n[Samsung Level On\nWireless](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/16807/51107/4/48896/?merchant=Amazon):\nAlthough the active noise cancelling was better than average, especially for\nthe price, the sound quality was middle-of-the-road. Mildly bloated and blurry\nlows caused the Level On Wireless to lose some clarity and definition; the\nresult wasn\u2019t bad, but our picks sounded better.\n\n[Sennheiser Momentum\nWireless](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34277/156073/4/99319/?merchant=Sennheiser):\nAlso known casually as the Momentum 3, this pair is the next iteration of the\nSennheiser Momentum/HD1 line. This latest version is an improvement but\nunfortunately not enough of a shift to maintain competitiveness with the\nincreasing number of new options. The overall design remains the same, but\nwith improved padding on the headband. The sound quality also hasn\u2019t changed:\nIn our tests, it produced rolled-off high frequencies and bloated, heightened\nbass, and everything sounded two-dimensional and somewhat dull in comparison\nwith the sound from other headphones in the $400 price range. The app has an\nEQ function, but the interface is so amorphous it\u2019s nearly useless. Although\nthe ANC is decently effective, it\u2019s not as powerful or adjustable as on the\nBose 700. The auto play/pause and on/off features are nice, and the\nmicrophones were very clear in our phone calls, but overall these headphones\ndon\u2019t live up to their $400 price tag.\n\n[Sennheiser HD\n350BT](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/38163/161415/4/113381/?merchant=Sennheiser):\nWhile this pair isn\u2019t exceptional enough to compete with our favorite wireless\nheadphones, it\u2019s still a decent affordable set for someone who wants aptX low-\nlatency. The bass is a little too forward for our taste, and the highs have a\nicy tinge to them that can make consonants pierce in an unnatural way. The\ncontrols are on the smaller side, and might take a bit of practice to use by\nfeel. However, the soft earpads, lightweight build, and moderate clamping\nforce should fit most folks comfortably\u2014with the exception of those with ears\nthat stick out. For you, the shallow earcups can leave your cartilage feeling\nsmashed after about 30 minutes of listening.\n\n[Sennheiser HD 4.50BTNC\nWireless](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/23481/126438/4/68153/?merchant=Amazon):\nVery comfortable. These headphones had the Sennheiser sound, producing an\nextra peak in the high-highs that was unnatural but not terrible or piercing,\npaired with clear, very deep bass. We liked these headphones a lot, but other\noptions sounded a little better or had better noise cancellation for the same\nprice. That said, if you want lightweight, comfortable headphones that sound\nquite good if a bit artificial, this set is a fine alternative to our picks.\n\n[Sony H.ear On 2 Mini\nWH-H800](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/23482/126447/4/68154/?merchant=Amazon):\nWe adored Sony\u2019s MDR-100ABN, which had been an upgrade pick in the past, so we\nwere excited for the Mini, a smaller, more portable version. Sadly, although\nthe looks and fit were similar, the Mini pair had way too much blurry bass and\nsmeared everything else. We wanted to love these headphones, but the sound let\nus down.\n\nThe [Sony H.ear On 2\nWH-H900N](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/23648/155815/4/75213/?merchant=Costco)\nwas our former top pick but has been going in and out of stock at most\nretailers. In our tests, this pair cancelled noise effectively without\nproducing the eardrum suck we\u2019ve experienced with more aggressive noise-\ncancelling headphones. These headphones sounded balanced and natural, and they\nwere comfortable to wear for hours, which is important if you\u2019re stuck on a\nlong flight or working in a noisy office. The 25-hour battery life means you\nget lots of use between charges. However, when folded up, they\u2019re a little\nbulkier than the Bose 700. If you can find this pair in stock, we still think\nit\u2019s an excellent choice.\n\n[Sony\nWH-1000XM3](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/28886/148639/4/85565/?merchant=Amazon):\nA lot of people love this pair for its excellent ANC and how very well made it\nfeels. But we just didn\u2019t love the sound as much as we did that of the\n[WH-H900N](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/23648/155815/4/75213/?merchant=Costco),\nespecially when we considered the higher price. A lot of the bonus features\nare less than helpful. Additionally, there have been complaints that this pair\n[malfunctions in colder\nweather](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/14/18181200/sony-\nwh-1000xm3-headphones-cold-weather-bugs) from 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.\nSony is addressing the problem, and the company informed us that there\u2019s no\nindication that the issue affects the WH-H900N. You can read more about how\nthe WH-1000XM3 fared against other ANC headphones in our [noise-cancelling\nheadphones guide](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-\ncancelling-headphones/).\n\n[Soul Electronics Ultra\nWireless](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/35827/158061/4/104510/?merchant=Soul%20Electronics%20):\nThese are super-comfortable to wear, but the bass is so bloated that with hip-\nhop music it sounds as though the male vocals have a blanket tossed over them.\n\n[Status Audio BT\nOne](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/35828/158062/4/104511/?merchant=Status):\nWe felt these headphones, with their lightweight but plasticky build, would\nbreak easily. The controls are a little on the small side. Sound-wise, the\nbass is too loud and the highs are unevenly boosted with a sizzly edge that\nturns the word \u201ctry\u201d into \u201ctchry.\u201d\n\n[TaoTronics TT-\nBH060](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/33233/154712/4/95995/?merchant=Amazon):\nThe tight headband pinched our skulls, the active noise cancellation wasn\u2019t\nextremely effective, and the sound was muffled. TaoTronics has been successful\nwith price-defying performance in the past, but these headphones didn\u2019t meet\nexpectations.\n\n[V-Moda Crossfade 2\nWireless](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/19642/105309/4/45920/?merchant=V-MODA):\nProviding balanced, vivid, and exciting sound, the Crossfade 2 Wireless boosts\nthe lowest bass notes and specific high frequencies to amp up music in a fun,\nenergizing way. The chassis is sturdy, edgy looking, and customizable, and it\nfolds up into a surprisingly small case. However, we struggled with making\nthis model a pick due to its price, weight, and lack of isolation. For the\ncurrent base price of $280 (features such as aptX, a removable boom mic, and\nextra shields add to the cost), we would have liked active noise cancelling or\nsome of those aforementioned add-ons included. We also questioned whether the\nweight of the Crossfade 2 would become uncomfortable to wear over a long day.\nKnowing all of these quibbles, if you still want the Crossfade 2, get it; you\nwon\u2019t be disappointed. But in a saturated category, even minimal downsides are\nenough to pull a headphone model out of contention as one of our picks.\n\n## Sources\n\n  1.
