It also makes pairing to your portable devices (e.g. smartphone,\nlaptop, tablet) more convenient, while offering listeners rich sound and\nspecial features that aren\u2019t available on wired headphones.\n\nWireless headphones are more in-demand than ever, especially as modern\nsmartphones ditch the headphone jack in favor of Bluetooth. Hence why we are\ntesting the top models from every major headphone brand such as Bose, Sony,\nand even Apple, along with rising stars like Jabra and JLab Audio. Our job is\nto find the right fit for your budget and style.\n\n  * The [best noise-cancelling headphones](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-noise-cancelling-headphones,review-5566.html) right now\n  * Our picks for the [best wireless earbuds](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-wireless-earbuds,review-6160.html)\n  * The [best computer speakers](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-computer-speakers,review-6355.html)\n\nIn compiling a list of the best wireless headphones, Tom\u2019s Guide evaluates\nseveral factors: including design, battery life, comfortability, and newly\nintroduced features that increase their value. We also test audio performance\nacross a range of music genres, as well as take controls and ease of use into\nconsideration.\n\nThat being said, if you're searching for over-ear headphones or wireless\nearbuds, the ideal place to start is right here. Let\u2019s take a look at the best\nwireless headphones you can buy now.\n\n## What are the best wireless headphones?\n\nAt the top of our list is the Bose 700, which also happens to be the No.1 pick\non our best noise cancelling headphones roundup. Bose updated its adaptive mic\nsystem to deliver champion active noise cancellation that can be adjusted\nacross 11 different levels via mobile app. The improvements in ANC circuitry\nalso boost sound and call quality, giving these noise-cancellers phenomenal\nall-around performance.\n\nNext up is the Apple AirPods Pro \u2013 a surprise launch that has dominated the\nwireless earbuds category with surprisingly good noise cancelation. Newer\nfeatures like the pinch-gesture controls and hands-free \u201cHey Siri\u201d support\nmake operating these pearly danglers a breeze, while series hallmarks such as\nthe 24-hour charging case and instant iOS connectivity remain intact.\n\nFor the best overall wireless earbuds, there is no better option than the all-\nnew Jabra Elite Active 75t. These sporty buds are the perfect balance of form\nand function, packing several listening features into a tiny waterproof\ndesign. Sound is dynamic, thanks to the inclusion of a built-in EQ and several\nmusic presets, and battery life surpasses all AirPods models: single charge\nand charging case capacities.\n\nThere are several other models available that are designed for practicality\nand individual needs, ranging from Apple-centric sports headphones (Beats\nPowerbeats Pro) to super-affordable earbuds (JLab JBuds Air). Additionally, we\njust found out about a new pair that challenges the AirPods Pro with most of\nthe same features and much better audio quality, the [Sennheiser Momentum True\nWireless 2](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/sennheiser-momentum-true-\nwireless-2), which seems poised to make its way onto this list, once tested by\nus.\n\nMake sure to bookmark this page, as Tom's Guide will continue to update it\nwith the latest and most popular releases. For wireless earbuds, we have our\neyes set on the industry\u2019s two worst-kept secrets: the [AirPods\n3](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-airpods-3) and [Samsung Galaxy Buds\nX](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/samsung-galaxy-buds-x-galaxy-buds-2) (aka\nGalaxy Buds 2). On-ear headphones like the [Apple AirPods\nStudio](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-airpods-studio) and [Sony\nWH-1000xM4](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/sony-wh-1000xm4) , two models that\nhave been rumored for months and are sure to generate serious buzz once\nofficially announced, remain on our radar as well.\n\n## The best wireless headphones right now\n\n![Best wireless headphones: Bose\n700](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n### 1\\.

The Bose 700 headphones have raised the bar\nfor active noise cancelling headphones, effectively silencing outside noise\nwhile simultaneously allowing you to clearly be heard when talking to someone\non the phone or cueing up a digital assistant. The 700s don't skimp on audio\nquality either, offering clean, balanced sound with some impressive, intuitive\ntech flourishes.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s the only model engineered with 11 levels of noise cancellation\nto keep things quiet without adding distortion to your music, and the Full\nTransparency mode is similarly impressive. The headphones also come available\nin four striking colors: Black, Luxe Silver, Soapstone, and Eclipse. The\nEclipse version is sold exclusively on Apple.com and Bose.com, and is bundled\nwith a travel charging case that holds 40 extra hours of playtime. Add it all\nup, and it's easy to see why the Bose 700 is our best wireless headphones\noverall.\n\n _See our full_[ _Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700\nreview_](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/bose-700-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones) _._\n\n![Best wireless headphones: Apple AirPods\nPro](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\n### 2\\.

Headlining its feature set is active noise cancellation, which is\nsurprisingly effective for hushing rowdy commuters and minimizing background\nnoises during phone calls. The addition of ear tips makes a world of\ndifference for both on-ear stability and sound quality; the tips produce a\nsafe, tight seal that allows music to sound fuller. Apple also developed an\nadaptive EQ that automatically tunes the low and mid frequencies to your ear\nshape. Adding to its audio capabilities, Apple recently confirmed an upcoming\n[iOS update](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/airpods-pro-just-got-a-huge-\nupgrade-in-ios-14-meet-spatial-audio) that will give the AirPods Pro two new\nfeatures: auto-switching between Apple devices and spacial audio to create a\n3D-dimension soundscape.\n\nHands? That's so pass\u00e9. Thanks to Apple's H1 chip, the AirPods Pro are packing\neven more hands-free Siri integration. Plus, you get the near-instant pairing\nand stable connections we've come to expect from an Apple audio product. And\nwith the new Force Sensors embedded in the redesigned stems, you may never\nneed to touch your smartphone ever again.\n\n_See our full_[ _Apple AirPods Pro\nreview_](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/apple-airpods-pro) _._\n\n![Best wireless headphones: Jabra Elite Active\n75t](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\nJabra Elite Active 75t (Image credit: Regan Coule/Tom's Guide)\n\n### 3\\.

These buds earned a perfect\nscore (5 stars) and our coveted Editor\u2019s Choice badge for their amazing\noverall performance. Design-wise, they are 22% smaller than their predecessor,\nthe critically acclaimed Elite Active 65t, and more rugged. Jabra also added\nIP57 certification to make them fully waterproof in up to 1 meter of water.\n\nAudio is another hallmark of the Elite Active 75t, delivering detailed and\nvibrant sound that gives music a lively presence. With the buds operating on\nBluetooth 5.0 technology, they consume less power, so that you get more use\nout of them when fully charged. Users can also pair to two devices\nsimultaneously and hear music wirelessly from a lengthy distance (est. 35\nfeet).\n\n **Note:** The latest firmware update welcomes two long-awaited features,\nMySound and MyControls, though the company confirmed it has scaled down\nfunctionality on the latter, stating Jabra was \u201cnot pleased with the user\nexperience.\u201d\n\n _See our full_[ _Jabra Elite Active 75t\nreview_](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/jabra-elite-active-75t-wireless-\nearbuds) _._\n\n![Best wireless headphones: Sony WH-1000XM3\nHeadphones](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\nSony WH-1000XM3 Headphones\n\n### 4\\.

The\nimprovements in audio fidelity alone place these wireless headphones nearly on\npar with the Bose 700. They deliver a powerful low-end punch suited for their\ntarget demographic, bass lovers, and grant listeners a suite of sound-\noptimizing options accessible through the Connect app. Most music genres are\nwell-represented, with live recordings shining in Ambient mode. The WH-1000XM3\neven supports five codecs for music playback \u2014 aptX, aptX HD, AAC, LDAC, and\nSBC \u2014 each engineered to maximize sound quality over Bluetooth.\n\nBut the WH-1000xM3 is not just about hitting your ear drums with a sonic boom.\nSony packs killer noise cancellation into a slender design, immersing\nlisteners into their Spotify playlists, while keeping distractions to a\nminimum; being trapped in the middle of a construction site is the only way\nyou\u2019re going to be pulled away from your music. Battery life is superior as\nwell, at 30 hours with ANC enabled.\n\n _See our full_[ _Sony WH-1000XM3 review_](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/sony-\nwh-1000xm3,review-5862.html) _.  \n_\n\n![Best wireless headphones: Samsung Galaxy Buds\nPlus](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\n### 5\\.

Should you want to purchase wireless headphones,\nlook at the bundled accessories listed on the packaging. On your radar should\nbe an aux cable, carry case, charging cable, and a user guide.\n\nIf you're interested in a pair of truly wireless buds, make sure you receive a\nhandful of extra ear tips, charging cable, user guide, and most importantly, a\ncharging case. Since earbuds have shorter battery life than over-the-ear\nheadphones, there's a great likelihood you'll have to charge them on the go.\n\nCustomization, while not a necessity, is something else to consider. Those who\nare interested in personalizing their own headphones or earbuds can check\nonline to see what brands have customization programs; Bose currently lets you\ndesign the QC35 II with 37 different colors and two finishes (high-gloss or\nanodized aluminum) for an extra $50.\n\n## How we test the best wireless headphones and earbuds\n\nTo help you separate the wheat from the chaff when shopping for headphones,\nTom's Guide evaluates the following criteria: design, comfort, features,\nperformance and value. We employ a rigorous review process, comparing products\nwith similar fit, features and pricing.\n\nEach pair is worn over the course of a week for 2 hours at a time. During this\ntesting period, the staff is evaluating comfort, ease of use and, of course,\naudio quality. We listen to several predetermined sample tracks that span a\nnumber of genres, including hip-hop, rock, jazz, classical and R&B, and we\nevaluate the volume, clarity and fullness.\n\nIn terms of features, we test the effectiveness of active noise cancelling,\nBluetooth range and battery life. For the fitness-focused models, we test to\nsee how they stand up to vigorous workouts, evaluating both how securely they\nfit while we exercise and how well they handle ambient noise from things like\nfalling weights and gym machines. We test every feature for app-enabled\nheadphones along with ease of setup.\n\nOnce we complete our testing, we rate headphones based on our five-point\nsystem (1 = worst, 5 = best). If a product is truly exemplary, it's awarded an\nEditors' Choice.\n\nAnd now that more streaming music services are offering high-resolution\nresolution audio, be sure to read our [audio codec\nFAQ](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/what-are-audio-codecs,review-4469.html) for\neverything you need to know about FLAC files, MP3s and everything in between.\n\n\u00b7 [Best Alexa headphones and earbuds](https://www.tomsguide.com/best-\npicks/best-alexa-headphones)\n\n\u00b7 [The best sport headphones for running and\nworkouts](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-sport-headphones,review-5567.html)\n\n\u00b7 [Best cheap wireless earbuds](https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-\ncheap-wireless-earbuds)\n\nTopics\n\n[Audio](https://www.tomsguide.com/topics/audio)\n\n[Headphones](https://www.tomsguide.com/topics/headphones)\n\n[Wearables](https://www.tomsguide.com/topics/wearables)\n\n__Be In the Know\n\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and\nhelpful tips.\n\nThank you for signing up to Tom's Guide.
