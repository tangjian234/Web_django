There are a couple of disadvantages compared to wired\nheadphones, like needing to keep an eye on battery levels and possible lip-\nsync issues when watching videos, but not having to worry about tangled cords\nwhen you're running out the door on a busy morning makes wireless headphones\nworth it for many.\n\nSo far, we've reviewed over 450 pairs of headphones, and below are our\nrecommendations for the best wireless headphones to buy. See also our\nrecommendations for the [best wireless\nearbuds](/headphones/reviews/best/wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-in-ear-\nheadphones), the [best on-ear wireless\nheadphones](/headphones/reviews/best/wireless-bluetooth-on-ear), and the [best\ntrue wireless earbuds](/headphones/reviews/best/by-type/truly-wireless-\nearbuds).\n\n  \n\n  1. ## Best Wireless Bluetooth Headphones: Bose QuietComfort 35 II/QC35 II Wireless 2018\n\n[![Bose QuietComfort 35 II/QC35 II Wireless 2018\nDesign](https://i.rtings.com/images/reviews/headphones/bose/quietcomfort-35-ii/quietcomfort-35-ii-\ndesign-tiny.jpg)](/headphones/reviews/bose/quietcomfort-35-ii-qc35-ii-\nwireless-2018)\n\n[Bose QuietComfort 35 II/QC35 II Wireless\n2018](/headphones/reviews/bose/quietcomfort-35-ii-qc35-ii-wireless-2018)\n![](https://i.rtings.com/images/menu/best-spacer.png) [ SEE PRICE Amazon.com\n](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NXDPLJ9?tag=rtings-hp-r-20&ie=UTF8)\n\n7.6\n\nMixed Usage\n\n7.7\n\nNeutral Sound\n\n8.0\n\nCommute/Travel\n\n7.3\n\nSports/Fitness\n\n7.8\n\nOffice\n\n6.1\n\nWireless Gaming\n\n7.7\n\nWired Gaming\n\n6.9\n\nPhone Calls\n\nType  Over-ear\n\nEnclosure  Closed-Back\n\nWireless  Yes\n\nNoise Cancelling  Yes\n\nMic  Yes\n\nTransducer  Dynamic\n\nThe best wireless headphones we've tested so far are the Bose QuietComfort 35\nII. These Bluetooth over-ear headphones are very lightweight and are among the\nmost comfortable headphones we've ever tested. They look and feel quite\npremium and well-built, and have easy-to-use physical controls that give you\naccess to a lot of commands. Their 20-hour battery life is great, and they\nsupport multi-device and NFC pairing to make pairing them to all your devices\neasier.\n\nTheir sound profile is very well-balanced, making them a great choice for a\nvery wide range of content and genres, though fans of a lot of kick and thump\nmay find their bass a little lacking. Their ANC feature is one of the best\nwe've reviewed to date, and they block out a good amount of engine rumble,\nmaking them a great choice for your daily commute or long plane rides. They\nalso do a superb job of blocking out background chatter and the high-pitched\nsound of AC units to help keep you concentrated in the office.\n\nUnfortunately, their dedicated companion app is very limited and it doesn't\ngive you access to any EQ settings, meaning you can't crank up the bass to\ngive your favorite EDM tracks more kick, which is a shame. Overall, however,\nthese are a good pair of wireless over-ears that are very comfortable and have\na superb ANC feature, making them among the [best\nheadphones](/headphones/reviews/best/headphones) we've tested to date.\n\n[See our review](/headphones/reviews/bose/quietcomfort-35-ii-qc35-ii-\nwireless-2018)\n\n  2. ## Customizable Alternative With Better ANC: Sony WH-1000XM3 Wireless\n\n[![Sony WH-1000XM3 Wireless\nDesign](https://i.rtings.com/images/reviews/headphones/sony/wh-1000xm3/wh-1000xm3-design-\ntiny.jpg)](/headphones/reviews/sony/wh-1000xm3-wireless)\n\n[Sony WH-1000XM3 Wireless](/headphones/reviews/sony/wh-1000xm3-wireless)\n![](https://i.rtings.com/images/menu/best-spacer.png) [ SEE PRICE Amazon.com\n](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G4MNFS1?tag=rtings-hp-r-20&ie=UTF8)\n\nType  Over-ear\n\nEnclosure  Closed-Back\n\nWireless  Yes\n\nNoise Cancelling  Yes\n\nMic  Yes\n\nTransducer  Dynamic\n\nIf you're looking for something with even more powerful noise cancelling and\nlike being able to fine-tune the way your headphones sound, then get the Sony\nWH-1000XM3. They're not quite as comfortable as the [Bose QuietComfort 35\nII/QC35 II Wireless 2018](/headphones/reviews/bose/quietcomfort-35-ii-qc35-ii-\nwireless-2018), and their touch-sensitive controls can be a bit finicky, but\ntheir ANC performs even better, and their companion app gives you access to a\ngraphic EQ to tweak the way they sound. Their ANC is the best we've tested to\ndate, blocking out noise even better than the Bose does, and their 27-hour\nbattery life is impressive. While they'll turn off automatically if they're\ndisconnected from their Bluetooth source, they don't have a true auto-off\ntimer; if you fall asleep in the train with these headphones on, their battery\nwill keep draining. Their touch-sensitive controls also don't work in the\ncold, which can be a deal-breaker if you live in colder climates.\n\nGet the Bose if you prefer physical controls or if you tend to find most over-\nears heavy and uncomfortable; however, if you have an extra noisy commute, or\njust want something you can customize to your heart's content, then you'll\nwant to go for the Sony.\n\n[See our review](/headphones/reviews/sony/wh-1000xm3-wireless)\n\n  3. ## Best Wireless Bluetooth Headphones Under $200: Razer Opus Wireless\n\n[![Razer Opus Wireless\nDesign](https://i.rtings.com/images/reviews/headphones/razer/opus/opus-design-\ntiny.jpg)](/headphones/reviews/razer/opus-wireless)\n\n[Razer Opus Wireless](/headphones/reviews/razer/opus-wireless)\n![](https://i.rtings.com/images/menu/best-spacer.png) [ SEE PRICE Amazon.com\n](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087D88N39?tag=rtings-hp-r-20&ie=UTF8)\n\n7.6\n\nMixed Usage\n\n7.6\n\nNeutral Sound\n\n8.2\n\nCommute/Travel\n\n7.5\n\nSports/Fitness\n\n7.8\n\nOffice\n\n5.8\n\nWireless Gaming\n\n7.5\n\nWired Gaming\n\n6.0\n\nPhone Calls\n\nType  Over-ear\n\nEnclosure  Closed-Back\n\nWireless  Yes\n\nNoise Cancelling  Yes\n\nMic  Yes\n\nTransducer  Dynamic\n\nThe best wireless headphones under $200 that we've tested so far are the Razer\nOpus. These ANC over-ears mark Razer's departure from gaming accessories and\nthey look very similar to the much-more-expensive [Sony WH-1000XM3\nWireless](/headphones/reviews/sony/wh-1000xm3-wireless). They feel well-built\nand comfortable and have easy-to-use physical controls on the ear cups. They\neven come with a good hard carrying case to help protect them when you toss\nthem in your luggage or bag.\n\nTheir default sound profile is very well-balanced and accurate, lending itself\nwell to a wide variety of genres and content. If you find they lack a bit of\nbass, that can easily be remedied thanks to the graphic EQ and presets in\ntheir dedicated companion app. Their most impressive feature is their ANC,\nwhich is surprisingly outstanding, especially considering their price point.\nThey're among the[ best noise cancelling\nheadphones](/headphones/reviews/best/by-feature/active-noise-cancelling) we've\ntested, making them an excellent choice to cut out engine noise on a bus or\nplane or cut out chatty coworkers in the office.\n\nUnfortunately, they lack multi-device pairing like some other options on this\nlist, so it's a bit more difficult to quickly switch between your phone and\nlaptop. Their microphone performance is also fairly disappointing overall, as\nthey don't do the best job at separating your voice from background noise.\nThat being said, the faults are few and far between with these headphones, and\nthey're surprisingly good for the price.\n\n[See our review](/headphones/reviews/razer/opus-wireless)\n\n  4. ## Best Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds: Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Truly Wireless\n\n[![Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Truly Wireless\nDesign](https://i.rtings.com/images/reviews/headphones/samsung/galaxy-buds-\nplus/galaxy-buds-plus-design-tiny.jpg)](/headphones/reviews/samsung/galaxy-\nbuds-plus-truly-wireless)\n\n[Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Truly Wireless](/headphones/reviews/samsung/galaxy-buds-\nplus-truly-wireless) ![](https://i.rtings.com/images/menu/best-spacer.png) [\nSEE PRICE Amazon.com ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083KZDHTS?tag=rtings-\nhp-r-20&ie=UTF8)\n\n7.4\n\nMixed Usage\n\n7.7\n\nNeutral Sound\n\n7.7\n\nCommute/Travel\n\n8.3\n\nSports/Fitness\n\n7.0\n\nOffice\n\n5.9\n\nWireless Gaming\n\n5.8\n\nWired Gaming\n\n6.6\n\nPhone Calls\n\nType  In-ear\n\nEnclosure  Closed-Back\n\nWireless  Truly Wireless\n\nNoise Cancelling  No\n\nMic  Yes\n\nTransducer  Dynamic\n\nThe best wireless headphones with an earbud design that we\u2019ve tested so far\nare the Samsung Galaxy Buds+. The original [Samsung Galaxy Buds Truly\nWireless](/headphones/reviews/samsung/galaxy-buds-truly-wireless) were already\na hit, but the new version knock them out of the park. They have the same\nsleek, ultra-compact truly design, but their battery performance is better\nthan ever. Their super portable charging case makes them easy to throw in your\npocket when you're on-the-go and even supports Qi wireless charging for added\nconvenience at your desk.\n\nThese truly wireless in-ears have an exceptionally well-balanced, neutral\nsound profile which makes them a versatile option for music of virtually all\ngenres. If you\u2019d like to tweak their sound profile a bit, you can use the EQ\npresets in their companion app to add a bit more bass or clarity. Their\n13-hour battery life is also among the best we\u2019ve seen, not just for truly\nwireless headphones, but for Bluetooth earbuds in general.\n\nOn the downside, their touch-sensitive controls won't be for everyone as it's\neasy to accidentally trigger a command when you're adjusting the earbuds. The\n[Jabra Elite Active 75t Truly Wireless](/headphones/reviews/jabra/elite-\nactive-75t-truly-wireless) have physical buttons that are easier-to-use, but\ntheir battery doesn't last as long on a single charge and their default sound\nprofile isn't as well-balanced. All things considered, the Samsung provide\nexcellent value for the price and are our [top recommendation for in-ear\nheadphones](/headphones/reviews/best/by-type/in-ear-earbuds).\n\n[See our review](/headphones/reviews/samsung/galaxy-buds-plus-truly-wireless)\n\n  5. ## Noise Cancelling Alternative: Apple AirPods Pro Truly Wireless\n\n[![Apple AirPods Pro Truly Wireless\nDesign](https://i.rtings.com/images/reviews/headphones/apple/airpods-\npro/airpods-pro-design-tiny.jpg)](/headphones/reviews/apple/airpods-pro-truly-\nwireless)\n\n[Apple AirPods Pro Truly Wireless](/headphones/reviews/apple/airpods-pro-\ntruly-wireless) ![](https://i.rtings.com/images/menu/best-spacer.png) [ SEE\nPRICE Amazon.com ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=rtings-\nhp-r-20&ie=UTF8)\n\nType  In-ear\n\nEnclosure  Closed-Back\n\nWireless  Truly Wireless\n\nNoise Cancelling  Yes\n\nMic  Yes\n\nTransducer  Dynamic\n\nIf you really like a truly wireless design but still need a pair of earbuds\nthat can help block some of the outside world around you, go for the Apple\nAirPods Pro. While they're more expensive than the [Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Truly\nWireless](/headphones/reviews/samsung/galaxy-buds-plus-truly-wireless) and\nthey lack audio customization features, their impressive active noise\ncancelling feature can help reduce background noise so that you can\nconcentrate on your day. Thanks to their Apple H1 chip, you can seamlessly\npair these earbuds with all Apple devices, which is great if you're always\nmoving between your laptop to your smartphone. They also have a well-balanced\nsound out-of-the-box, although some may find their thump and rumble a little\nlight. On the downside, they only have five hours of continuous battery life\nwhich, on its own, may not be enough to get you through your work day.\nHowever, they have an excellent charging case that provides five additional\ncharges, so you don't have to worry so much about running out of battery life.\n\nIf you're looking for headphones with a customizable sound profile, get the\nSamsung. However, if you're not into tweaking your sound and prefer to have\nactive noise cancelling to help block out noise around you, go with the Apple.\n\n[See our review](/headphones/reviews/apple/airpods-pro-truly-wireless)\n\n  6. ## Best Wireless Bluetooth Headphones for Working Out: Jaybird Tarah Pro Wireless\n\n[![Jaybird Tarah Pro Wireless\nDesign](https://i.rtings.com/images/reviews/headphones/jaybird/tarah-\npro/tarah-pro-design-tiny.jpg)](/headphones/reviews/jaybird/tarah-pro-\nwireless)\n\n[Jaybird Tarah Pro Wireless](/headphones/reviews/jaybird/tarah-pro-wireless)\n![](https://i.rtings.com/images/menu/best-spacer.png) [ Unavailable Amazon.com\n](http://www.amazon.com/?tag=rtings-out-20)\n\n7.2\n\nMixed Usage\n\n7.0\n\nNeutral Sound\n\n7.7\n\nCommute/Travel\n\n8.2\n\nSports/Fitness\n\n7.0\n\nOffice\n\n5.7\n\nWireless Gaming\n\n5.5\n\nWired Gaming\n\n6.5\n\nPhone Calls\n\nType  In-ear\n\nEnclosure  Closed-Back\n\nWireless  Yes\n\nNoise Cancelling  No\n\nMic  Yes\n\nTransducer  Dynamic\n\nThe Jaybird Tarah Pro are the best Bluetooth headphones for working out that\nwe've tested so far. Whether you're a casual jogger or a pro athlete, these\nwireless earbuds are durable and stable enough to survive tough workouts.\nThey're also rated IPX7 for water resistance, although we don't currently test\nfor it.\n\nRight out-of-the-box, they have a decently balanced sound profile that should\nbe suitable for most users. If you like to customize your sound experience,\ntheir companion app offers a parametric EQ as well as presets so you can\nreally tweak them to your liking. Their in-line remote is a nice touch, as you\ncan quickly adjust the volume or skip tracks even while you're on the move.\nTheir 13-hour battery life should also last long enough for most workouts or\nphysical activities and they even have an auto-off timer that's automatically\ntriggered when the earbuds snap together, which is great for saving power when\nnot in use.\n\nOn the downside, they use a proprietary charging cradle with a short cable, so\nyou won't be able to borrow a friend's USB cable if you forget the cradle and\nneed to charge your headphones. They also don't have multi-device or NFC\npairing. Still, all in all, these earbuds are a great choice for active users\nwho want wireless headphones that work as hard as they do.\n\n[See our review](/headphones/reviews/jaybird/tarah-pro-wireless)\n\n  7. ## Best Budget Wireless Bluetooth Headphones: Anker Soundcore Life Q20 Wireless\n\n[![Anker Soundcore Life Q20 Wireless\nDesign](https://i.rtings.com/images/reviews/headphones/anker/soundcore-\nlife-q20/soundcore-life-q20-design-\ntiny.jpg)](/headphones/reviews/anker/soundcore-life-q20-wireless)\n\n[Anker Soundcore Life Q20 Wireless](/headphones/reviews/anker/soundcore-\nlife-q20-wireless) ![](https://i.rtings.com/images/menu/best-spacer.png) [ SEE\nPRICE Amazon.com ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NM3RSRQ?tag=rtings-\nhp-r-20&ie=UTF8)\n\n6.9\n\nMixed Usage\n\n6.5\n\nNeutral Sound\n\n7.4\n\nCommute/Travel\n\n7.1\n\nSports/Fitness\n\n7.0\n\nOffice\n\n5.2\n\nWireless Gaming\n\n6.9\n\nWired Gaming\n\n6.9\n\nPhone Calls\n\nType  Over-ear\n\nEnclosure  Closed-Back\n\nWireless  Yes\n\nNoise Cancelling  Yes\n\nMic  Yes\n\nTransducer  Dynamic\n\nThe best wireless headphones in the budget range we\u2019ve tested so far are the\nAnker Soundcore Life Q20. They\u2019re the updated version of the [Anker SoundCore\nLife 2 Wireless](/headphones/reviews/anker/soundcore-life-2-wireless) and pack\na few solid upgrades, like better noise cancelling and battery performance.\nThey're very comfortable, feel fairly well-built, and look pretty sleek.\n\nThese wireless over-ears have an excited sound signature that packs lots of\nthump and punch while still sounding pretty well-balanced overall. There's\neven a bass-boost button if you desire even more bass. Their noise cancelling\nis quite good and will help quiet many disruptive noises during your day.\nTheir 32-hour battery life also ensures you'll be able to keep listening to\nyour heart's desire; just remember to turn them off when you're done since\nthey don't have an auto-off timer.\n\nWhile fans of EDM and hip-hop are sure to appreciate their added bass, if you\nprefer classical, jazz, or even rock music, you might find these headphones\ntoo bass-heavy, especially if you hit the bass-boost button by accident. That\nsaid, they don't sound too muddy or cluttered, and have a bit of extra\nbrightness to counteract all the bass. They provide good value for the price\noverall and are quite easy to recommend.\n\n[See our review](/headphones/reviews/anker/soundcore-life-q20-wireless)\n\n  8. ## Cheaper Earbud Alternative: Anker SoundBuds Curve Upgraded 2019\n\n[![Anker SoundBuds Curve Upgraded 2019\nDesign](https://i.rtings.com/images/reviews/headphones/anker/soundbuds-curve-\nupgraded-2019/soundbuds-curve-upgraded-2019-design-\ntiny.jpg)](/headphones/reviews/anker/soundbuds-curve-upgraded-2019)\n\n[Anker SoundBuds Curve Upgraded 2019](/headphones/reviews/anker/soundbuds-\ncurve-upgraded-2019) ![](https://i.rtings.com/images/menu/best-spacer.png) [\nSEE PRICE Amazon.com ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0721MP41Q?tag=rtings-\nhp-r-20&ie=UTF8)\n\nType  In-ear\n\nEnclosure  Closed-Back\n\nWireless  Yes\n\nNoise Cancelling  No\n\nMic  Yes\n\nTransducer  Dynamic\n\nIf you prefer the fit and portability of earbuds, get the Anker SoundBuds\nCurve Upgraded 2019. They don't have ANC like the [Anker Soundcore Life Q20\nWireless](/headphones/reviews/anker/soundcore-life-q20-wireless), and they\ndon't last as long off a single charge, but they're much easier to toss into a\npocket, and are even cheaper. Their 18.4-hour battery life is the longest\nwe've ever tested on a pair of wireless earbuds, and they're surprisingly\ncomfortable since they don't enter your ear canal too deeply. While their\nsound profile is fairly well-balanced, some people may find them a bit bass-\nheavy, making them better suited to genres like EDM or hip-hop. Also, the L/R\nearbuds each feel decently well-built and durable, but the thin connecting\nthem is quite thin, though this is expected considering their very low price\npoint.\n\nOverall, if you prefer over-ears, or want headphones with a very good ANC\nfeature, get the Q20, but if you prefer the portability of earbuds or want to\nspend even less, the Curve are among the [best Bluetooth\nearbuds](/headphones/reviews/best/wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-in-ear-\nheadphones) we've tested.\n\n[See our review](/headphones/reviews/anker/soundbuds-curve-upgraded-2019)\n\n## Notable Mentions\n\n  * **Jabra Elite 85h Wireless:** The Elite 85h are comfortable over-ear headphones with a great physical control scheme and well-balanced sound, but their ANC isn't on par with other noise cancelling headsets. [See our review](/headphones/reviews/jabra/elite-85h-wireless)\n  * **Plantronics BackBeat Pro 2 Wireless 2016:** The BackBeat Pro 2 are very well-rounded mid-range over-ear headphones. A slightly cheaper alternative to the Razer Opus Wireless, but with a much worse ANC feature. [See our review](/headphones/reviews/plantronics/backbeat-pro-2-wireless-2016)\n  * **Bowers & Wilkins PX7 Wireless:** The PX7 Wireless are premium wireless headphones with great noise cancelling and excellent build quality, but their sound profile is rather bass-heavy. [See our review](/headphones/reviews/bowers-wilkins/px7-wireless)\n  * **Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H9i Wireless:** The H9i are very well-built, comfortable over-ears with outstanding battery performance, but their noise cancelling is only decent and their exaggerated V-shaped frequency response won't be for everyone. [See our review](/headphones/reviews/bang-olufsen/beoplay-h9i-wireless)\n  * **Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless:** The Momentum 3 Wireless perform quite well overall but aren't quite on par with the Bose QuietComfort 35 II and Sony WH-1000XM3 for around the same price. [See our review](/headphones/reviews/sennheiser/momentum-3-wireless)\n  * **Bose SoundLink On-Ear Wireless:** The SoundLink On-Ear are comfortable on-ear headphones with a well-balanced sound but don't isolate noise very well, which is limiting. [See our review](/headphones/reviews/bose/soundlink-on-ear-wireless)\n  * **Mpow H10 Wireless:** The H10 are budget headphones range that sound fairly well-balanced and have great noise cancelling, but feel pretty cheaply made. [See our review](/headphones/reviews/mpow/h10-wireless)\n  * **Anker SoundCore Liberty Air 2 Truly Wireless:** The Liberty Air 2 are truly wireless in-ears that offer a great price-to-performance ratio. Cheaper alternative to the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ that feature wireless charging and a graphic EQ, but much shorter battery life. [See our review](/headphones/reviews/anker/soundcore-liberty-air-2-truly-wireless)\n  * **AUKEY Latitude Wireless:** The Latitude are cheap wireless earbuds that isolate a remarkable amount of noise and have some neat Bluetooth features, but they aren't the most comfortable. [See our review](/headphones/reviews/aukey/latitude-wireless)\n\n## Recent Updates\n\n**07/10/2020:** Added Razer Opus Wireless as \"Best Wireless Bluetooth\nHeadphones Under $200\". Updated text for accuracy and clarity.\n\n**06/05/2020:** Moved Jaybird Tarah Pro Wireless to a new category: Best\nWireless Bluetooth Headphones for Working Out.\n\n**02/07/2020:** Replaced the Anker SoundBuds Curve Wireless with the Anker\nSoundBuds Curve Upgraded 2019.\n\n**01/10/2020:** Replaced Anker SoundCore Liberty Air with Anker SoundCore\nLiberty Air 2.\n\n## All Reviews\n\nOur recommendations above are what we think are currently the best Bluetooth\nheadphones to buy for most people in each price range. We factor in the price\n(cheaper headphones win over pricier ones if the difference isn't worth it),\nfeedback from our visitors, and availability (no headphones that are difficult\nto find or almost out of stock everywhere).\n\nIf you would like to choose for yourself, here is the list of all our reviews\nfor wireless headphones.
