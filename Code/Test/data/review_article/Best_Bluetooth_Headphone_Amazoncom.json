I started with testing fitment /\nadjustment to my head using the sliders (stainless steel sliders, nicely\ndone!) while also testing the ability for folding the headphones (worked\ngreat, very solid feeling). The memory foam ear cushions and along the inside\nof the headphone band where the top of your head will touch feel very\ncomfortable with good spring in the foam. It is an attractive set of\nheadphones, good use of contrast red, silver, and black. The device is touted\nto NOT be active noise canceling so we'll test passive noise reduction with\nthe over-the-ears cushions.  \n  \nThe device has user controls on one side (power, volume up, volume down, track\nforward, track reverse, play / pause) on the right-ear ...[ full\nreview](/review/R35WX3YYIFLODD)\n\n__[ (34,954) ](/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2?ref_=fsclp_pl_nr_1)\n\n[ See All Buying Options ](/gp/offer-listing/B01NAJGGA2?ref_=fsclp_pl_abo_1)\n\nAdd to My List\n\n* * *\n\n[ ![COWIN E7 Active Noise Cancelling Headphones Bluetooth Headphones with\nMicrophone Deep Bass Wireless Headphones Over Ear, Comfortable Protein\nEarpads, 30 Hours Playtime for Travel/Work, Black](https://images-na.ssl-\nimages-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif)![COWIN E7 Active\nNoise Cancelling Headphones Bluetooth Headphones with Microphone Deep Bass\nWireless Headphones Over Ear, Comfortable Protein Earpads, 30 Hours Playtime\nfor Travel/Work, Black](https://m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/61oEU8lUE9L._SR500,500_.jpg) ](/Cancelling-Headphones-\nBluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/dp/B019U00D7K?ref_=fsclp_pl_dp_2)\n\n[ COWIN E7 Active Noise Cancelling Headphones Bluetooth Headphones with\nMicrophone Deep Bass Wireless Headphones Over Ear, Comfortable Protein\nEarpads, 30 Hours Playtime for Travel/Work, Black ](/Cancelling-Headphones-\nBluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/dp/B019U00D7K?ref_=fsclp_pl_dp_2)\n\nby [ cowin\n](/stores/cowin/page/491CF957-AE7A-4394-AA5D-D0CA188D4415?ref_=ast_bln&ref_=fsclp_pl_s_2)\n\n\"\"ESCAPE THE NOISE\"\"  \\- by  Paul  (ARIZONA DESERT)\n\n\"TUNE OUT THE WORLD, FOR $70\" Noise cancelling that works at a very reasonable\nprice!

These phones sound great, are very comfortable to wear, 30 hour play\ntime and if you do manage to run down the batt. just plug them in to the wired\ninput to connect the phones to the player and keep listening.  \nAs I tried to quickly discuss in the video the fit and comfort of these phones\nwill vary with different size and shape heads so you'll just have to try them\non. (think shoes) As far as sound, I am a retired professional studio\nmusician, trumpet player, and I've used headphones that would sell for around\n$5,000 at today's prices, so let's not go crazy comparing apples & oranges!
