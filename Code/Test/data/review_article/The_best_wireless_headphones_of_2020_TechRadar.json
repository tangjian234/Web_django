They sound great thanks to a\ncombination of superb wireless codecs \u2013 aptX and Sony's proprietary LDAC tech\n\u2013 and keep outside noise at bay thanks to Sony's ever-improving noise-\ncancellation algorithms.\n\nWhile the Sony WH-1000XM3 might not be a massive improvement over last year's\nWH-1000XM2, they're still a cut above their rivals, the Bose Noise Cancelling\nHeadphones 700, in nearly every way: they sound better, they block out noise\nbetter and have better features like Quick Attention mode that lets in all\noutside noise without taking off the headphones. (The latter is perfect when\ngiving a drink order on a plane or speaking to a coworker for a brief moment\nbefore diving back into your work.)\n\nGreat-sounding and feature-packed, these impressive [Sony\nheadphones](https://www.techradar.com/best/sony-headphones) are great travel\ncompanions and all-around excellent wireless headphones \u2013 and while we're\nhoping to see the [Sony WH-1000XM4](https://www.techradar.com/news/sony-\nwh-1000xm4-what-we-want-to-see-from-sonys-new-wireless-headphones) this year,\nthey're still the best wireless headphones of 2020.\n\n **Read more:** [Sony WH-1000XM3\nreview](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/hands-on-sony-wh-1000xm3-wireless-\nheadphones-review)\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n![Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones\n700](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Bose)\n\n### 2\\.

That said, purists will bemoan the lack of high-end codec support\nand there are punchier wireless headphones on the market at this price point.\n\nWhen you consider that Jabra\u2019s Elite 85h headphones are the company\u2019s first\nattempt at premium wireless ANC headphones, the result is quite commendable.\nWe can\u2019t wait to see what the company\u2019s next premium ANC headphones will\naccomplish.\n\nIf you want an alternative to Sony's WH-1000XM3, these wireless headphones are\na great choice.\n\n **Read more:** [Jabra Elite 85H\nreview](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/jabra-elite-85h)\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n![Bose QuietComfort 35\nII](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Bose)\n\n### 5\\.

This means you still get the class-leading\nnoise cancellation Bose is known for, good sound quality, and incredible\ncomfort. Said simply, these wireless headphones sound great and their battery\nlife is long enough for all but the longest of flights.\n\nDespite the popularity of the QC35s, Bose has shaken things up by releasing a\ntotally new wireless noise-cancelling headphones model, with a focus on sleek\ndesign and \u201cbreakthrough\u201d audio tech: the [Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones\n700](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/bose-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones-700-review).

Battery life also\ndoesn't compete with the Sony WH-1000XM3s, and they're more expensive to boot.\n\nSo, why buy the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless? Well, if built-in Tile\ntracking appeals to you, and you like the industrial design and premium\nmaterials of the Momentum Wireless, that could be reason enough \u2013 and if you\ndo opt for them over the Sony model, you won\u2019t be missing out on any audio\nquality.
