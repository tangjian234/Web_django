Whether you're using a portable speaker at\nthe beach, or listening to music at home, Bluetooth speakers are the most\nversatile way to enjoy your music. We've put together a list of the best\nBluetooth and wireless speakers of this year, as well as some useful buying\nadvice. For more background information on Bluetooth and wireless speakers,\nsee our comparison table and buying advice below the picks.  \n\n## **Best Overall Wireless Speaker**\n\n### **1.[Sonos One (Gen 2)\n($199)](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7383536-13355209?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fshop%2Fone-white.html&cjsku=ONEG2US1)**\n\n![Sonos-One \\(Gend\n2\\)](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/Sonos-\nOne%20-%20Wireless%20Speakers.jpg)**Portable:** No  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Wi-Fi  \n **Dimensions:** 6.34\u201d x 4.72\u201d x 4.72\u201d  \n **What We Like:** Super simple to set up and use, excellent sound quality,\ngreat design.  \n **What We Don't:** No Bluetooth, and switching between voice assistants can\nbe tricky.\n\nWe\u2019ve been fans of Sonos for years\u2014they make some of the best wireless\nspeakers available\u2014and the second generation of the One is no exception. It\u2019s\nan absolute breeze to set up, thanks to a fast and responsive app. And once\nyou\u2019ve got it working (which takes just a few minutes) you\u2019ll be rewarded with\npowerful, punchy sound quality that easily beats competing models from brands\nlike Bose and Ultimate Ears. In addition, the One allows streaming from just\nabout every music provider you can think of, it works seamlessly with Apple\nAirplay 2, and gives you access to smart voice assistants from Amazon and\nGoogle. We\u2019ve had this wireless speaker in our testing room almost since its\nrelease, and keep coming back for the impressive sound quality, versatility,\nand ease-of-use.\n\nOne thing to be aware of, though: the Sonos One doesn\u2019t have Bluetooth. It\noperates on Wi-Fi only and has no battery, meaning you\u2019ll need a signal and a\npower connection. If you\u2019re looking for a speaker to take outdoors, we\u2019d\nrecommend the lighter and more rugged JBL Flip 4 below, which also happens to\nbe significantly less expensive (albeit at the sacrifice of sound quality).\nSonos does make a portable Bluetooth speaker called the Move, but it\u2019s double\nthe price of the One and much larger. And for $20 less, the One SL is the same\nspeaker minus the microphone and voice assistants... _[Read our in-depth\nreview](https://www.themasterswitch.com/review-sonos-one)_  \n[See the Sonos One (Gen\n2)](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7383536-13355209?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fshop%2Fone-white.html&cjsku=ONEG2US1)  \n\n## **Best Outdoor/Portable Bluetooth Speaker**\n\n### **2.[JBL Flip 4\n($74)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSYQWNY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=themasswi0f-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01MSYQWNY&linkId=a2ee8d0d9529a8d854ef53a718b699c7)**\n\n![JBL Flip\n4](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/May%2020%20Update/JBL-\nFlip-4-White-Space.jpg)**Portable:** Yes - 10 Hours Battery, IPX7 Waterproof  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Bluetooth  \n **Dimensions:** 2.67\u201d x 6.88\u201d x 2.75\u201d  \n **What We Like:** Almost fully waterproof, housing can take a real beating,\npunchy sound quality.  \n **What We Don't:** App issues and slightly distorted bass at high volumes.\n\nPortability is a highly sought-after feature in a Bluetooth speaker\u2014you can\ntake yours out for a backyard BBQ, to the beach, stuff it in your pack, or\neven attach it to your bike. And if you\u2019re looking for a model to take outside\nrain or shine, then we highly recommend the JBL Flip 4. This slick little\nspeaker is almost fully waterproof with a rating of IPX7 (comparable to more\nexpensive models like the Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST below) and comes in a rugged\nyet lightweight housing designed to take a beating. Importantly, we think the\nFlip 4 sounds considerably better than other portable/outdoor speakers in its\nprice range. The audio quality is terrific, and the speaker is loud enough to\nbe heard over a crowded backyard or beach, although there is a slight\ndistortion in the bass at high volumes.\n\nIn testing, we encountered a few issues with the JBL Connect+ app used to\ncontrol the speaker, such as dropouts and lag. And it\u2019s worth noting that JBL\nhas released the newer Flip 5, which currently retails for around $100. Both\nspeakers offer a listed 12 hours of playtime, have the same waterproof rating,\nand the same speaker set-up and sound quality overall. Moreover, the Flip 5\ndoesn't even get you the latest Bluetooth 5.0 standard (it's still operating\non 4.2), so there's no notable technological jump. Charge time on the Flip 5\nis slightly less, which is nice, but it's not enough to merit the increased\nprice in our book\u2026 _[Read our in-depth\nreview](https://www.themasterswitch.com/review-jbl-flip-4)_  \n[See the JBL Flip\n4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSYQWNY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=themasswi0f-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01MSYQWNY&linkId=a2ee8d0d9529a8d854ef53a718b699c7)  \n\n## **Best Budget Bluetooth Speaker Under $50**\n\n### **3.[Anker Soundcore Flare Mini ($40)](https://amzn.to/3bQ0SAF) **\n\n![Anker Soundcore Flare Mini\n](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/May%2020%20Update/Anker%20Soundcore%20Flare%20Mini%20.jpg)**Portable:**\nYes - 11.5 Hours Battery, IPX7 Waterproof  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Bluetooth  \n **Dimensions:** 5.5\u201d x 3.4\u201d x 2.8\u201d  \n **What We Like:** Small size, sleek design, great waterproofing.  \n **What We Don't:** No app support and the lights on the bottom can be\nannoying.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to sell a kidney to buy a great Bluetooth speaker. In fact, we\nhave been pleasantly surprised with the options in the sub-$50 price range,\nand the Anker Flare Mini leads the pack. For just $40, you get good sound\nquality overall with crisp treble and punchy bass, even at higher volumes. In\naddition, the Flare Mini has an IPX7 waterproof rating\u2014the same as the JBL\nFlip 4 above\u2014although that model is significantly more rugged and durable.\nWe\u2019re also rather enamored with the slick and modern design. All in all, a\ngreat budget Bluetooth speaker should be fun and offer solid bang-for-buck,\nand the Flare Mini does both.\n\nSurprisingly, at the time of publishing the Anker Soundcore Flare Mini is not\nsupported by the company\u2019s excellent Soundcore app, which is a disappointment.\nThat means the speaker is a little tougher to control than other models,\nrelying purely on physical controls. And despite the fun design, the light-up\nbar along the bottom certainly isn\u2019t for everyone. If you like your Bluetooth\nspeakers to be heard and not seen, steer clear. In terms of competing models,\nthe JBL Clip 3 below is $10 more expensive and has a lot going for it too.  \n[See the Anker Soundcore Flare Mini](https://amzn.to/3bQ0SAF)  \n\n## **Best High-End Bluetooth Speaker**\n\n### **4.[Sonos Move\n($399)](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7383536-13355209?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fshop%2Fmove-black.html&cjsku=MOVE1US1BLK)**\n\n![Sonos\nMove](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/Oct%2019%20Update/Sonos%20Move.jpg)**Portable:**\nYes - 10 Hours Battery, IP56 Waterproof  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Both  \n **Dimensions:** 9.44\u201d x 6.29\u201d x 4.96\u201d  \n **What We Like:** Sounds terrific and is incredible easy to use.  \n **What We Don't:** The speaker requires a sizeable charging dock and\nstruggles in the wet.\n\nThe Sonos Move is a weird, wild, wonderful monster. It takes everything Sonos\nis good at\u2014easy set-up, simple app, solid sound\u2014and packages it in a speaker\nthat can be taken anywhere. The Move can connect to your home Wi-Fi network,\nand unlike the Sonos One above, change to Bluetooth when you take it outside.\nIt\u2019s stupendously simple to operate, and the rich, powerful sound quality is\nout of this world. However, it costs almost double the One, which makes it a\ntrue high-ender and puts it out of reach for some. But it\u2019s hugely rewarding\nand offers things the One and other speakers simply can\u2019t. We adore ours and\nuse it constantly.\n\nThat said, the Sonos Move is not perfect. It has no USB charging, as you will\nfind just about every other Bluetooth speaker. Instead, you have to slide it\ninto the large charging dock, which is connected to wall power. That\u2019s much\nless convenient than a simple USB connection\u2014you aren\u2019t, after all, going to\nbe taking the charging dock with you when you leave the house. We also found\nthat while the Move has a decent waterproof rating, the touch controls\nstruggled when wet. Those issues aside, the Sonos Move is an outstanding\nBluetooth speaker and delivers some of the best sound we\u2019ve ever heard, which\nis why we have it ranked here... _[Read our in-depth\nreview](https://www.themasterswitch.com/sonos-move-review)_  \n[See the Sonos\nMove](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7383536-13355209?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fshop%2Fmove-black.html&cjsku=MOVE1US1BLK)  \n\n## **Best Bluetooth/Wireless Speaker For Home Theater**\n\n### **5.[Samsung HW-R450 ($178)](https://amzn.to/2Vu0Nxk)**\n\n![Samsung 2.1 Soundbar HW-R450\n](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/May%2020%20Update/Samsung%202.1%20Soundbar%20HW-R450%20.jpg)**Portable:**\nNo  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Bluetooth  \n **Dimensions:** 35.73\u201d x 2.11\u201d x 2.78\u201d  \n **What We Like:** Easy to set-up and use, and it sounds terrific.  \n **What We Don't:** We think the bass could be a little better.\n\nWhen it comes to wireless home theater, you have two options. You can either\nspend thousands on a fully wireless multi-speaker system, or you can go for a\nsoundbar, like the excellent Samsung HW-R450. It has Bluetooth and is quite\nhappy receiving both the sound from your TV or phone (if you want to listen to\nmusic). The HW-R450 also is simple to setup and use\u2014not quite as easy as the\nSonos speakers above, but still very straightforward. If you\u2019re looking for\naudio detail and a wide soundstage for your movies and Netflix series, you\u2019ve\ncome to the right place.\n\nThe Samsung HW-R450 comes with a fully wireless subwoofer for bass, which is\nconvenient, but we do wish it was better quality. While it gets the job done,\nthe bass can be a little flabby and underpowered, especially with elements\nlike explosions. But for the most part, the Samsung HW-R450 delivers excellent\naudio quality overall. We should note that it\u2019s entirely possible to use\nBluetooth speakers with stereo pairing, like the JBL Flip 4, as TV speakers,\nbut it can be tricky to set up and often struggles with surround sound. In our\nopinion, the HW-R450 is a much better option.  \n[See the Samsung HW-R450](https://amzn.to/2Vu0Nxk)  \n\n## **Best Bluetooth Speaker for Bass**\n\n### **6.[Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST ($250)](https://amzn.to/2OoXTXZ)**\n\n![Ultimate Ears\nMEGABLAST](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/May%2020%20Update/Ultimate-\nEars-MEGABLAST-White-Space.jpg)**Portable:** Yes - 15 Hours Battery, IPX7\nWaterproof  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Both  \n **Dimensions:** 9.41\u201d x 3.5\u201d (Cylinder)  \n **What We Like:** If you want huge volume and great bass, the MEGABLAST leads\nthe pack.  \n **What We Don't:** We did encounter a few Wi-Fi dropouts.\n\nBass can be very tricky to get right. It has to sound controlled, punchy, and\nheavy at all volumes. Most speakers distort when you push them too hard\u2014their\ntiny drivers just can\u2019t handle it\u2014but the Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST is in a\nleague of its own. It delivers some of the most ridiculous bass we\u2019ve heard\nfrom a Bluetooth speaker. And not just big, but also clear and distinct. While\nit\u2019s true that the $250 MEGABLAST is significantly more expensive than most\nother speakers on this list, you also get excellent voice control features,\nIPX7 waterproofing, and rugged design.\n\nLike the Sonos Move above, the Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST can connect to both\nBluetooth and Wi-Fi. Unfortunately, we experienced regular Wi-Fi dropouts,\nwhich was frustrating. The Bluetooth worked fine, but we found ourselves\nsteering clear of connecting this speaker to a Wi-Fi network. And it\u2019s worth\nnoting that if you\u2019re not interested in voice assistants or Wi-Fi\nfunctionality, you can get the smaller Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM 3 for just under\n$150. That speaker doesn\u2019t have quite the same bass kick, but delivers good\nsound and longer battery life for less money.  \n[See the Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST](https://amzn.to/2OoXTXZ)  \n\n## **Best of the Rest**\n\n### **7.[Amazon Echo Dot With Clock (3rd Gen)\n($60)](https://amzn.to/34ryMsg)**\n\n****![Echo Dot \\(3rd\nGen\\)](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/Echo%20Dot%20\\(3rd%20Gen\\).jpg)**Portable:**\nNo  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Wi-Fi  \n **Dimensions:** 3.9\" x 1.69\" (Disk)  \n **What We Like:** A significant improvement on an already decent product.  \n **What We Don't:** Needs another speaker to get the best out of it.\n\nIf you want a wireless speaker for the bedroom, or anywhere else you might\nneed to look at the time, issue voice commands (like setting an alarm) or\ncontrol music, go for the Amazon Echo Dot With Clock. It\u2019s the third\ngeneration of Amazon\u2019s Echo Dot line, and it\u2019s almost perfect. Amazon\u2019s smart\nassistant, Alexa, still has a little way to go in terms of intelligence -\nGoogle Assistant is simply better - but if you want a speaker to help out with\ntimers, weather, and simple search queries, the Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) is\nthe wireless speaker to go for. We also love how well Alexa integrates with\nother apps through its Skills function, which means the Echo Dot can slip\nseamlessly into your life. Amazon may not have especially imaginative speaker\nnames, but no other speaker here comes with an included clock, and that gives\nthe Dot an advantage right from the get-go.\n\nOur biggest criticism is that the Echo Dot still sounds best when used as the\nsmart brain of a bigger wireless speaker. You could, for example, connect it\nto a JBL Flip 4, above, which would not only increase your sound quality but\nallow you to direct things with your voice. If you plan on using this as a\nstand-alone speaker, we'd strongly recommend you buy two. That way, you get\nthe benefit of a stereo spread. All the same, this is a superb little smart\nspeaker, and a really good wireless speaker overall...  \n[See the Amazon Echo Dot With Clock (3rd Gen)](https://amzn.to/34ryMsg)  \n\n### ** 8\\. [Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM 2 ($100)](https://amzn.to/2N8tKfW)**\n\n****![Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM\n2](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/June%2019%20Update/Ultimate%20Ears%20WONDERBOOM%202.jpg)**Portable:**\nYes - 13 Hours Battery, IP67 Waterproof  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Bluetooth  \n **Dimensions:** 4\" x 3.66\" (Cylinder)  \n **What We Like:** Good battery life, punchy and engaging sound.  \n **What We Don't:** Can\u2019t take calls, micro-USB charging only.\n\nThe second version of the best-selling Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM speaker makes\nsome significant changes. Foremost among these is the battery life, increased\nfrom 10 hours to 13. It also comes with an Outdoor Boost feature, designed to\npour more power into the bass, so that the speaker can be heard in crowded\nenvironments like barbecues and pool parties. And speaking of pool parties,\nthe WONDERBOOM 2 is now IP67 rated, making it perfect for taking a quick dunk\nin the pool. Its hefty battery life and fun, exciting sound quality means it\u2019s\nthe perfect companion for hanging out with friends.\n\nWhile we do wish that UE had included USB-C charging instead of the current\nmicro-USB (an older standard, and far less efficient) it\u2019s a minor black mark.\nWhat may be trickier is the speaker\u2019s inability to take phone calls, but that\ndepends on how much you value that feature. If you do want to take calls on\nyour speaker, we recommend the Bose SoundLink Color II. That offers slightly\nbetter sound quality, too.  \n[See the Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM 2](https://amzn.to/2N8tKfW)  \n\n### **9.[JBL Clip 3 ($70)](https://amzn.to/3e9jSuu) **\n\n![JBL Clip\n3](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/May%2020%20Update/JBL%20Clip%203.jpg)**Portable:**\nYes - 9 Hours Battery, IPX7 Waterproof  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Bluetooth  \n **Dimensions:** 5.4\u201d x 3.8\u201d x 1.8\"  \n **What We Like:** An amazingly convenient little speaker which sounds great\nfor podcasts.  \n **What We Don't:** Music can sound a little tinny.\n\nNo other Bluetooth or wireless speaker on this list is as light as the eight-\nounce JBL Clip 3, and none has a handy carabiner that lets you clip it to a\nbackpack or a belt. This means you never have to remember it\u2014all you need to\ndo is pick up your backpack and it\u2019s right there with you. The Clip 3 offers\ndecent performance too, with a comfortable nine hours of battery life and IPX7\nwaterproofing (identical to the JBL Flip 4 as well as many other more\nexpensive speakers like the Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST). While it doesn\u2019t have\nthe rugged design of something like the JBL Flip 4, which is only slightly\nmore expensive, it\u2019s way more convenient.\n\nHowever, the tiny size of the Clip 3 has some disadvantage\u2014sonic ones.\nPodcasts and vocals sound clear but music can come through tinny and\nindistinct. That\u2019s a real shame and means that listening to music on the Clip\n3 is far less satisfying than on a speaker like the JBL Flip 4. The Clip 3,\nhowever, still has plenty going for it. If all you want is a tiny Bluetooth\nspeaker to take with you when you head outdoors\u2014and one that you don\u2019t have to\nthink about\u2014the convenience is unparalleled.  \n[See the JBL Clip 3 ](https://amzn.to/3e9jSuu)  \n\n### **10.[Bose SoundLink Color II\n($129)](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7383536-13378794?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fspeakers%2Fportable_speakers%2Fsoundlink-\ncolor-bluetooth-speaker-\nii.html%3Fmc%3D25_AF_MU_AO_00_CJ_%23v%3Dsoundlink_color_ii_citron&cjsku=752195-0900)**\n\n****![Bose Sound Link Color Bluetooth Speaker\nII](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/Oct%2019%20Update/Bose%20Sound%20Link%20Color%20Bluetooth%20Speaker%20II.jpg)**Portable:**\nYes - 7 Hours Battery, Waterproof Rating Unknown  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Bluetooth  \n **Dimensions:** 5.2\" x 5\" x 2.2\"  \n **What We Like:** Good sound for the price, solid speakerphone to make and\nreceive calls.  \n **What We Don't:** The finish picks up dust like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\n\nBose would prefer you spend hundreds of dollars on their newest wireless\nspeakers, but we believe you don\u2019t have to. The Bose SoundLink Color II may be\na little old now, but it is easily among the best wireless speakers the\ncompany has ever produced. It\u2019s a compact, portable speaker that is small\nenough to slip into a bag, and which puts out decent sound quality. Unlike the\nSonos One, above, the SoundLink Color II has the ability to make and receive\ncalls, and it\u2019s a feature that works exceptionally well. Although that doesn\u2019t\nmake it a more essential purchase than the Sonos, it does earn it a spot in\nour top five. And if you find yourself taking calls on the go, the SoundLink\nColor II is a great option.\n\nThere are downsides to this speaker, however. Despite the speaker being\nwaterproof, there\u2019s no IP rating (check out our buying advice below for more\ndetails on what this is). This makes it difficult to compare to other speakers\nin terms of durability, and although it is quite capable of withstanding a\nlittle rain, we aren\u2019t sure we\u2019d dunk it in the pool. In addition, despite the\nwonderful colors available, the finish does tend to attract dust. There\u2019s also\nno smart assistant functionality, but given the speaker\u2019s age, this is\nunsurprising. If you want a rugged, portable speaker with added Amazon Alexa\nor Google Assistant, the JBL Flip 4 is the speaker to go for. Bose have newer\nspeakers, like the imaginatively-named Portable Home Speaker, which has both\nWi-Fi and Bluetooth, but that costs $350. The $129 SoundLink is more than\nadequate for most people.  \n[See the Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth Speaker\nII](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7383536-13378794?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fspeakers%2Fportable_speakers%2Fsoundlink-\ncolor-bluetooth-speaker-\nii.html%3Fmc%3D25_AF_MU_AO_00_CJ_%23v%3Dsoundlink_color_ii_citron&cjsku=752195-0900)  \n\n### **11.[Klipsch The Three II\n($399)](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-7383536-13359547?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldwidestereo.com%2Fproducts%2Fklipsch-\nheritage-wireless-the-three-ii-tabletop-stereo-\nsystem%3Fsku%3D173334&cjsku=173334)**\n\n![Klipsch Heritage Wireless The Three II\n](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/May%2020%20Update/Klipsch%20Heritage%20Wireless%20The%20Three%20II%20.jpg)**Portable:**\nNo  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Bluetooth  \n **Dimensions:** 13.7\u201d x 7\u201d x 8\"  \n **What We Like:** Outstanding audio quality, genuinely beautiful looks.  \n**What We Don't:** Low maximum volume compared to other speakers in its price\nrange.\n\nKlipsch is as old-school as they come, so it\u2019s surprising how good The Three\nII really is. This high-end Bluetooth speaker isn\u2019t portable and doesn\u2019t offer\nthe versatility of the Sonos Move above, but it sounds significantly better,\ndelivering clear and beautiful audio quality. It also looks fantastic,\nmanaging to combine traditional aesthetics with modern touches like the clean\nline of physical controls. It\u2019s lack of portability means that it\u2019s one of the\nfew Bluetooth-only speakers designed specifically for home use rather than\noutdoors, but you\u2019d be hard-pressed to beat the sound quality for the price.\n\nThe Klipsch Three II does have its shortcomings, however. During testing, we\nfound that its maximum volume wasn\u2019t huge. While it\u2019s more than sufficient for\nmost rooms, it can\u2019t compete in terms of sheer audio power with speakers like\nthe Sonos Move or Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST, both of which are less expensive.\nThis shouldn\u2019t be a problem if you don\u2019t plan to blast music super loud, but\nit\u2019s definitely something to bear in mind. And one other concern we have is\ncost\u2014the Three II is the second most expensive speaker on this list after the\nmonster Naim number below.  \n[See the Klipsch The Three\nII](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-7383536-13359547?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldwidestereo.com%2Fproducts%2Fklipsch-\nheritage-wireless-the-three-ii-tabletop-stereo-\nsystem%3Fsku%3D173334&cjsku=173334)  \n\n### **12.[VIZIO SB2920-C6 ($79)](https://amzn.to/31bUDlV)**\n\n![VIZIO\nSB2920-C6](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/May%2020%20Update/VIZIO%20SB2920-C6.jpg)**Portable:**\nNo  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Bluetooth  \n **Dimensions:** 29\" x 3\" x 3\u201d  \n **What We Like:** This compact soundbar offers ridiculous value.  \n **What We Don't:** We didn\u2019t like the finicky controls, and there\u2019s no\nsubwoofer.\n\nMaking your TV audio wireless can be tricky and expensive, and that\u2019s why we\nrecommend soundbars as your first option. That\u2019s especially true for the VIZIO\nSB2920-C6. For under $100, you get a simple, compact soundbar and Bluetooth\nspeaker that sounds great. While it doesn\u2019t compare to the pricier Samsung\nHW-R450 above, which is our top pick for wireless home theater, the VIZIO\u2019s\nfriendly price tag and solid sound quality make it worth considering for those\non a budget. For reference, the the SB2920-C6 costs only slightly more than\nthe JBL Flip 4, a simple Bluetooth speaker for outdoor use.\n\nBe aware that unlike the Samsung HW-R450, the VIZIO SB2920-C6 has no subwoofer\nand won\u2019t satisfy those who are looking for heavy bass. In addition, we aren\u2019t\nwild about the controls, which can be a little finicky to use. However, in\nterms of making it cheap and easy to get a wireless speaker connected to your\nTV, the Bluetooth-equipped SB2920-C6 is a nice choice.  \n[See the VIZIO SB2920-C6](https://amzn.to/31bUDlV)  \n\n### ** 13\\.

The functionality of the Google\nAssistant is far superior to Amazon Alexa and Apple\u2019s Siri. The main selling\npoint of the Home Mini is that it\u2019s the single easiest way to get the best\nvirtual assistant into your home. Google make newer and more fully featured\nspeakers, but we don\u2019t think they beat any of the others on this list, and\nthey don\u2019t offer the value that the Home Mini does. It\u2019s incredibly easy to\nset up, and given that most people use Google in some form anyway, it can be\nvery helpful to have around.\n\nThe only downside to the Google Home Mini is that this speaker isn't sound-\nfocused - meaning you aren't going to use this to appreciate your music.\nYou'll most likely be using it to handle smart assistant tasks, or to control\na larger, better speaker. If you want an affordable, small smart speaker that\ncan handle music, we recommend the Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen), above, which is\nonly about $20 more.  \n[See the Google Home\nMini](https://store.google.com/us/product/google_home_mini?hl=en-US)\n\n###  \n**14.[JBL Charge 4 ($180)](https://amzn.to/31Ur1wg)**\n\n![JBL Charge\n4](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/May%2020%20Update/JBL%20Charge%204.jpg)**Portable:**\nYes - 20 Hours Battery, IPX7 Waterproof  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Bluetooth  \n **Dimensions:** 8.66\u201d x 3.74\u201d x 3.66\u201d  \n **What We Like:** Fantastic battery life - and it can also charge your other\ndevices.  \n **What We Don't:** No USB charging cable included.\n\nThe JBL Charge 4 Has one killer selling point that we haven\u2019t seen on other\nBluetooth speakers: you can use it as a battery pack to charge other devices\nlike your phone. And given that it has a listed 20 hours of battery life, you\ncan juice your phone and still have plenty of power left for your music. We do\nthink that the rugged and portable JBL Flip 4 above is the superior speaker\noverall, plus it\u2019s less than half the price of the Charge 4. But the latter\nstill a solid speaker with powerful sound quality and a nice range of\nfeatures.\n\nAs good as it is, we do think there are better options than the Charge 4, such\nas the Bose SoundLink Color II. The sound quality is good, but the Bose is\nmuch better in that area, even if it doesn\u2019t have that cool charging feature.\nAnd although more expensive, the Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST delivers heavier,\nmore exciting bass. That said, consider the Charge 4 an interesting\nalternative to the other speakers on this list, and one that can do something\nthey can\u2019t... _[Read our in-depth\nreview](https://www.themasterswitch.com/review-jbl-charge-3)_  \n[See the JBL Charge 4](https://amzn.to/31Ur1wg)  \n\n### **15.[Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM 3 ($146)](https://amzn.to/2KavpgO)**\n\n![Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM\n3](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/May%2020%20Update/Ultimate-\nEars-MEGABOOM-3-White-Space.jpg)**Portable:** Yes - 19.5 Hours Battery, IP67\nWaterproof  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Bluetooth  \n **Dimensions:** 8.9\" x 3.4\u201d (Cylinder)  \n **What We Like:** Excellent battery life, good features, attractive price.  \n **What We Don't:** The audio quality isn\u2019t as good as it could be.\n\nWe believe that you shouldn\u2019t have to pay for features you don\u2019t need, and\nthat\u2019s what makes the Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM 3 so appealing. It\u2019s around $100\ncheaper than its bigger brother, the bass-heavy MEGABLAST above. The two\nspeakers are similar, but the MEGABOOM 3 has no Wi-Fi and no voice assistant.\nThat makes it a simpler option for those who don\u2019t plan on using those\nfeatures. It also has 19.5 hours of battery life, which is among the best on\nthis list, along with excellent waterproofing and rugged housing that makes it\na good match for dedicated outdoor speakers like the JBL Flip 4.\n\nWe do wish that the sound quality on the Ultimate Ears Megaboom was a little\nbit better. We weren\u2019t expecting the same volume and power that you get from\nthe pricier MEGABLAST or the more expensive Sonos Move, but we also weren\u2019t\nexpecting it to sound the way it did, which was ever so slightly thin and\nmuddled. It\u2019s a solid speaker overall, but we give the nod to models like the\nJBL Charge 4, which is only slightly more expensive but does a better job\noverall.  \n[See the Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM 3](https://amzn.to/2KavpgO)  \n\n### ** 16\\.

Chief among these is sound quality, which is\nterrific. Bose know how to ring stupendous sound out of a small speaker, and\nthey definitely manage that here. It's comparable in loudness to the\nMEGABLAST, and is splash-resistant. As long as you're happy just using\nBluetooth, it makes for an excellent alternative. We also adore the handle,\nwhich makes transporting the speaker a breeze.\n\nHowever, the UE MEGABLAST, above, is clearly superior to the Bose SoundLink\nRevolve+. It not only costs less, but offers full Wi-Fi capability and a smart\nassistant. Regardless, the SoundLink Revolve+ is still a great speaker, and\nwhile it can't compete with the MEGABLAST, there's plenty to recommend about\nit. We also recommend buying this model over the original SoundLink Revolve.\nThat speaker loses the handle, has lower battery life, and isn't nearly as\npowerful. Bose also recently released a new smart wireless speaker, the Home\nSpeaker 500. It's a perfectly capable speaker, but we think it's too pricey\nright now. For the time being, this one is better.  \n[See the Bose SoundLink\nRevolve+](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-7383536-13359547?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldwidestereo.com%2Fproducts%2Fbose-\nsoundlink-revolve-plus-bluetooth-speaker%3Fsku%3D168314&cjsku=168314)  \n\n### **17.[Bang & Olufsen Beoplay P6 ($400)](https://amzn.to/3evSY1l)**\n\n![Bang %26 Olufsen Beoplay\nP6](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/May%2020%20Update/Bang%20%26%20Olufsen%20Beoplay%20P6.jpg)**Portable:**\nYes - 15 Hours Battery, Waterproof Rating Unknown  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Bluetooth  \n **Dimensions:** 6.69\u201d x 5.12\u201d x 2.68\u201d  \n **What We Like:** One of the most gorgeous Bluetooth speakers we\u2019ve ever\nseen.  \n **What We Don't:** Awful app and high price tag.\n\nVery few Bluetooth speakers can be considered a work of art, but the Bang &\nOlufsen Beoplay P6 is just that. The gentle curves and hefty build match well\nwith the leather carrying strap, easily making the P6 one of the best-looking\nBluetooth speakers we\u2019ve ever seen. Moreover, the sound is superb and offers a\nlevel of precision that very few speakers can match. For example, it runs\ncircles around the similarly priced Sonos Move in terms of both sound and\nlooks. It\u2019s also lighter and a lot easier to carry at 2.2 pounds versus 6.6\npounds for the Sonos.\n\nWhy do we have the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay P6 ranked this low? For $400, we\nexpected a better range of features. 15 hours of battery life is good but not\ngreat, and there\u2019s no Wi-Fi connectivity or 3.5mm input. In addition, the Bang\n& Olufsen app just isn\u2019t very good\u2014we\u2019ve found it to be unintuitive and bare-\nboned. So while the Beoplay P6 is around the same price as the Sonos Move and\nslightly less expensive than the Klipsch The Three II, the inferior features\nwere a notable downside for us.  \n[See the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay P6](https://amzn.to/3evSY1l)  \n\n### ** 18\\.

They absolutely can, and the Tribit XSound Go proves\nit. The XSound Go is a compact, portable wireless speaker that offers\ngenuinely surprising sound. If you\u2019re interested in great audio quality, but\nyou don\u2019t want to pay the earth for it, then we strongly recommend this\nparticular speaker. It\u2019s got a great feature set, too, with high-level\nwaterproofing and 22 hours of battery \u2013 comparable to the excellent Anker\nSoundCore, at 24 hours.\n\nHowever, there is so much competition at this price range, like the Anker\nSoundCore Flare Mini, that the XSound Go\u2019s flaws really stand out. It\u2019s\nheavier than a lot of its competitors, and it takes around seven to eight\nhours to reach a full charge. That\u2019s outrageous, frankly. These issues mean\nthat the XSound Go shouldn\u2019t be your first option, but if you value sound\nquality above everything, then it\u2019s definitely worth looking at.  \n[See the Tribit XSound Go](https://amzn.to/2IDu69D)  \n\n### **19.[DOSS SoundBox Touch ($40)](https://amzn.to/2pSFHLs)**\n\n****![DOSS\nSoundBox](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/Oct%2019%20Update/DOSS%20SoundBox.jpg)**Portable:**\nYes - 10 Hours Battery, Waterproof Rating Unknown  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Bluetooth  \n **Dimensions:** 6.6\u201d x 2.9\u201d x 2.7\u201d  \n **What We Like:** Comes with a travel case, and an option for microSD card.  \n **What We Don't:** Struggles to compete with other models, lack of\nwaterproofing\n\nWe\u2019ll admit that the DOSS SoundBox Touch isn\u2019t going to be a first choice for\nanyone. In a world where the less expensive Anker SoundCore Flare Mini speaker\nexists, it\u2019s a good alternative, rather than a number one pick. It delivers\ndecent overall value, with 10 hours of battery life, but we are concerned\nabout the lack of waterproofing. The sound quality is middling, unlikely to\nbother the big boys, and it\u2019s quite heavy at 1.65lbs.\n\nHowever, the DOSS SoundBox Touch does do a couple of things that other\nspeakers don\u2019t \u2013 and those things earn it a place on this list. The one thing\nwe loved about this model is that it has a microSD card slot. This is great if\nyou have audio files on hand \u2013 it sounds old-fashioned, but it\u2019s not as rare\nas you might think. We also really like the fact that it comes with a travel\ncase, which may go some way to mitigating the lack of waterproofing. We\nconsider the SoundBox Touch a solid performer with a couple of key features,\nbut that doesn\u2019t quite do enough to make it into the big leagues.  \n[See the DOSS SoundBox Touch](https://amzn.to/2pSFHLs)  \n\n## **And For When You Win the Lottery**\n\n### **20.[Naim Mu-so Qb 2nd Generation ($990)](https://amzn.to/3aFjW4k)**\n\n![Naim Mu-so Qb 2nd Generation\n](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/May%2020%20Update/Naim%20Mu-\nso%20Qb%202nd%20Generation%20.jpg)**Portable:** Very much no.  \n **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi:** Both  \n **Dimensions:** 8.27\u201d x 8.58\u201d x 8.35\u201d  \n **What We Like:** This speaker matches luxurious design with insane sound\nquality.  \n **What We Don't:** It\u2019s way too expensive for most people.\n\nSimply put, the Naim Mu-so Qb 2nd Generation easily is the best-sounding\nwireless speaker we\u2019ve ever heard. It\u2019s hard to believe just how crisp, clean,\nand deep the audio quality is. It helps that the Mu-so Qb not only sounds\ngreat, but looks great, too. The subtle curves on the speaker grills and giant\nvolume knob on top (which doubles as a touchscreen) make it an eye-catching\nstatement piece. And the Mu-so Qb is as fully featured as you\u2019d expect, so no\nmatter what the music source, chances are the Mu-so Qb will be able to play\nit.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, Naim is a British brand who makes some incredibly\nhigh-end audio products, and the Mu-so Qb actually is on the more affordable\nend of their spectrum. Unfortunately, the price tag still is steep and will\nput it out of reach for most people. If you want a premium Bluetooth speaker\nbut don\u2019t want to break to bank, we recommend the $399 Sonos Move above. It\nstill sounds good, although not quite as precise as the Naim. If you have the\nmoney to spend, however, then you\u2019ll find yourself with one of the best\nspeakers ever made.

If you ask us, the Flip\n4 is a much more fun and versatile speaker sound-wise, plus it\u2019s way more\nrugged than the somewhat staid Bose.\n\nIn fact, we are going to say something controversial here. Sound quality is\nimportant, but when it comes to a Bluetooth speaker, it\u2019s far less impactful\nthan you might think. You also should take a close look at the various\nfeatures a speaker offers. Does it have a smart assistant? Can it make and\nreceive calls? If you\u2019re going to be taking your speaker out of the house, is\nit weather resistant? How heavy is it? What\u2019s the range of its Bluetooth\nconnection? How big is it or is it an awkward shape? We aren\u2019t saying that you\nshould disregard sound entirely, and in all our choices in the list above,\nwe\u2019ve been careful to explain whether or not we think the sound of a\nparticular speaker is good or not. But for many people, it shouldn\u2019t be the\nprimary consideration when there\u2019s so much else to explore.\n\n![Ultimate Ears has an excellent app for its BLAST and MEGABLAST speakers |\nThe Master Switch\n\u200b](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/UE-MEGABLAST---\nWireless-Speakers.jpg)\n\n### **Connectivity: Bluetooth vs. Wireless**\n\nWireless speakers can get their music in two ways. They can either receive it\nover Wi-Fi networks, like the one that powers your home Internet, or they can\nreceive it over a direct Bluetooth connection. Let\u2019s start by talking about\nBluetooth, which is a connection directly between devices, like your phone and\nyour speaker. Bluetooth doesn\u2019t rely on networks that already exist, like your\nhome Wi-Fi. Bluetooth has very much become the gold standard for wireless\nmusic, in the sense that it is easy-to-use and almost ubiquitous. It\u2019s found\neven in the least expensive speakers you can buy, including the cheapest model\non our list, the $33 [Tribit XSound Go](https://amzn.to/2IDu69D).\n\nThe more data that gets sent over a Bluetooth signal, the better the sound\nquality will be. While new standards mean higher data and faster transmission,\nwith fewer dropouts, there still are caps on how much data can be sent. This\nis where Wi-Fi enabled speakers come in. These speakers connect directly to an\nexisting wireless network. This means they can receive more data, and more\ndata equals more detail, which equals better sound. We've encountered this\nwith several speakers, most notably the [Ultimate Ears\nMEGABLAST](https://amzn.to/2OoXTXZ). This speaker has both Bluetooth and Wi-\nFi, and the sound quality on the latter is crisper.\n\nThe problem is, if you have a lot of devices on your home network, adding in\none or more wireless speakers can bring things to a grinding halt. It doesn't\nmatter how data-rich the audio stream is\u2014if it's having to share space with\nweb browing, Netflix, and gaming, then it's going to slow down. It\u2019s also a\nproblem if you plan on taking your speaker out of the house. If you are\nplanning on doing so, then you want to make sure that your speaker has\nBluetooth and not just Wi-Fi. We love the $199 [Sonos One (Gen\n2)](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7383536-13355209?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fshop%2Fone-white.html&cjsku=ONEG2US1) ([full review\nhere](https://www.themasterswitch.com/review-sonos-one)), but it\u2019s not\nportable.\n\n![Sonos One Wireless Speaker | The Master\nSwitch](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/SONOS-ONE---\nWireless-Speakers.jpg)\n\n### **Bluetooth 4.2 vs. 5.0**\n\nBluetooth works so well that it often seems like magic. It actually works by\nusing a specific software package called a codec. A codec helps two devices\nspeak to each other, which is how your phone can transmit audio wirelessly to\nyour speaker. Bluetooth codecs always are being redeveloped by industry\nprofessionals, and new versions constantly make their way into the wider\nworld. These versions are often simply noted with a number, and right now,\nthere are two main industry standards: Bluetooth 4.2, and Bluetooth 5.0.\n\nBluetooth 4.2 arguably is the most widespread codec, and virtually every\nspeaker on our list uses it. It allows transfer speeds of up to one megabyte\nper second (1Mbps) and a range of up to 200 feet. That\u2019s more than enough for\nmost people and will give you excellent sound quality, but Bluetooth 5.0 is a\nmassive leap forward. It not only increases transfer speeds to 2MBps, but also\nquadruples the range up to 800 feet (providing there are no walls or other\nmajor obstacles in the way, of course). In addition, it uses less power\nthrough a standard known as Bluetooth Low Energy, and allows you to play audio\non two wireless speakers at a time. By the way, if you\u2019re interested, you\u2019ll\nfind a much more [in-depth breakdown on the actual Bluetooth\nwebsite](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/solutions/audio-\nstreaming/) \u2013 believe it or not, Bluetooth is an actual company, not just a\nthing you use to play music.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker: Bluetooth 5.0 isn\u2019t widespread yet. It\u2019s expensive to\nimplement and it\u2019s actually quite tricky to find a wireless speaker that uses\nit. Right now, every single speaker on our list uses Bluetooth 4.2, and\nmanufacturers have often found clever workarounds to avoid losing out on the\ncool features of 5.0. For example: the $74 [JBL Flip\n4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSYQWNY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=themasswi0f-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01MSYQWNY&linkId=a2ee8d0d9529a8d854ef53a718b699c7),\nour top outdoor/portable speaker pick, allows you to send audio from your\nphone to more than one JBL speaker at a time through its JBL Connect+ feature.\nThe feature allows you, in fact, to stream to up to 100 speakers, which is the\nbest kind of overkill. Also, if anyone reading this has actually streamed\naudio to 100 speakers at a time, please get in touch and tell us what it was\nlike. We test thoroughly, but not _that_ thoroughly.\n\n![JBL Bluetooth speakers | The Master\nSwitch](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/JBL---\nWireless-Speakers.jpg)\n\n### **Portability**\n\nWhen it comes to portability, weight is key. You are, after all, going to be\nthe one hefting the speaker around, so generally speaking, lighter is better.\nBut there\u2019s a trade-off here that you need to be aware of. Lighter speakers\ntend to sacrifice sound quality. That\u2019s because speaker drivers\u2014the part of\nthe speaker that actually makes sound\u2014and other internal components tend to\nproduce better audio quality when they are made of denser, stiffer material.\nDenser material means extra weight, and so when manufacturers are trying to\nkeep speakers light, sound quality can take a hit.\n\nAs such, it\u2019s worth thinking about how much weight you\u2019re prepared to carry\naround with you. For example, the $40 [Anker Soundcore Flare\nMini](https://amzn.to/3bQ0SAF), our top budget pick, weighs just over a pound,\nwhich is light enough for most people to put in a backpack or jacket pocket.\nYou wouldn\u2019t be able to slip the $399 [Sonos\nMove](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7383536-13355209?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fshop%2Fmove-black.html&cjsku=MOVE1US1BLK) ([full review\nhere](https://www.themasterswitch.com/sonos-move-review)) into your jacket,\nnot when it weighs a hefty 6.6 pounds. However, while we love the Anker,\nthere\u2019s no question that the Sonos Move is significantly better. Ultimately,\nwhen you are looking to buy a portable Bluetooth speaker, you need to think\nabout how much weight you\u2019re prepared to carry around with you.\n\n![Ultimate Ears / Amazon Echo wireless and Bluetooth speakers | The Master\nSwitch](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/Echo-Dot-\nand-MEGABLAST---Wireless-Speakers.jpg)\n\n### **Durability and Water Resistance**\n\nFor those who plan on taking their Bluetooth speakers outdoors, it\u2019s worth\ntalking about how water resistant they are. There\u2019s an easy way to objectively\nmeasure just how much punishment a speaker can take. It\u2019s called the IP\nRating, which stands for Ingress Protection. With each IP rating, there are\ntwo numbers you need to worry about. The first indicates the speaker\u2019s\nprotection from dust and dirt, and the second number indicates the protection\nfrom water. The higher the number, the more protection is available ([you can\nsee an easy breakdown of the level of protection each number provides\nhere](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/IP_Code)). We\u2019ve indicated the IP rating for\neach of our speaker picks, where applicable, in the table above. By the way,\nyou\u2019ll sometimes see IP ratings listed with an X in place of the first number\n\u2013 as in, IPX7. All this means is that the speaker in question is not rated for\ndust protection. As long as you don\u2019t bury it in sand, you should be fine.\n\nLet\u2019s take the[ ](https://amzn.to/2pVnGw4)$100 [Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM\n2](https://amzn.to/2N8tKfW), for example, which has an IP67 rating. This means\nthat it is completely resistant to dust, and can withstand being dunked in\nthree feet of water for thirty minutes. That\u2019s darn good, and while we don\u2019t\nthink the WONDERBOOM 2 is the best speaker out there, it compares favorably to\nour top outdoor/portable speaker, the $74 [JBL Flip\n4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSYQWNY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=themasswi0f-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01MSYQWNY&linkId=a2ee8d0d9529a8d854ef53a718b699c7),\nwhich is IPX7 rated. That means it has an identical waterproof rating, and has\nno rating for dust protection.\n\nSo why is the JBL higher on our list than the WONDERBOOM 2? Funny you should\nask, and it comes down to its durability and rugged housing. There is no\nindustry metric to measure durability as there is for waterproofing (try as we\nmight, we couldn\u2019t convince our bosses to buy us a sledgehammer and an impact\nmeasurement kit). But the Flip 4 is the perfect example of the concept that if\nyou\u2019re going for a good portable outdoor speaker, it\u2019s best to get one with\nthe casing that can withstand drops and being knocked around. In our opinion,\nthe Flip 4\u2019s rugged casing is best-in-class for this. Picking a speaker for\ndurability isn\u2019t just about how much water or dust it can resist; it\u2019s also\nabout whether or not the speaker will perform if you knock it off the table\nonto the floor, or if it gets jostled in your backpack.\n\n![Ultime Ears Bluetooth speakers | The Master\nSwitch](/sites/default/files/Review%20Images/UE%20MEGABLAST/MAGABLAST---\nBOOM-1.jpg)\n\n### **Battery Life**\n\nSeveral of the speakers on our list are fully portable, meaning that they run\noff a battery and don't require you to connect them to a power outlet except\nto charge. Very obviously, this is super convenient and allows you to get\ngreat sound in just about any situation.\n\nPlease take these listed battery ratings with a grain of salt, and never trust\nwhat the manufacturer tells you about battery life. The louder you play a\nspeaker, the more power it uses, which drains the battery faster.\nManufacturers obviously want to present the best possible numbers for their\nspeakers, so they don't usually reveal the volume levels at which their stated\nbattery hours were achieved. Usually it\u2019s quite low, which means the battery\nlasts longer. While we certainly aren't accusing any specific manufacturer of\nfudging the numbers, we also want you to approach battery numbers with a\nhealthy dose of skepticism. In real life, they almost never measure up to what\nthe manufacturer claims.\n\nLet's take our top budget speaker for bass, the $250 [Ultimate Ears\nMEGABLAST](https://amzn.to/2OoXTXZ). The Ultimate Ears website states that\nyou'll get up 16 hours of battery life, but they further state in a footnote\nthat \u201cActual battery life will vary with use, settings, and environmental\nconditions.\u201d When we tested it, we found it to be less than that. This doesn\u2019t\nmean that Ultimate Ears was lying\u2014we may have played it at a slightly higher\nvolume than they did, or the battery in our test model had degraded slightly,\nor any number of things\u2014but it\u2019s always good to take estimates with a grain of\nsalt. Forcing the speaker to perform at a high level\u2014which includes things\nlike playing music at high volumes, making or receiving phone calls, and\nconnecting to more than one Bluetooth device at once\u2014will drain the battery\nfaster. The battery also will drain in extreme cold or extreme heat.\n\n![JBL and Ultimate Ears Bluetooth speakers | The Master\nSwitch](/sites/default/files/Review%20Images/JBL%20Flip%204/JBL-Flip-4---\nComparison-1.jpg)\n\n### **Charge Time**\n\nOne of the things that can be frustrating about portable Bluetooth speakers is\nhow long they take to charge. As a general rule, Bluetooth speakers take\nbetween two and five hours to charge fully when connected to mains power. Even\nthe fastest, the $399 [Sonos\nMove](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7383536-13355209?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fshop%2Fmove-black.html&cjsku=MOVE1US1BLK) ([full review\nhere](https://www.themasterswitch.com/sonos-move-review)) and the $400 [Bang &\nOlufsen Beoplay P6](https://amzn.to/3evSY1l), take around two hours. You\nobviously don\u2019t have to charge a Bluetooth speaker all the way to use it\u2014it\u2019s\nentirely possible to plug it in for a few minutes and still get some power for\na couple of hours of use. But this varies depending on speaker, and in\ngeneral, we always recommend charging for the full length of time if possible.\nIt\u2019s better for the battery, and you\u2019ll have an accurate idea of just how much\nlife your speaker will have. Below, you'll find a list of charge times for all\nthe Bluetooth speakers on our list.\n\n**Bluetooth Speaker** | **Price** | **Battery** | **Charge Time**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**[JBL Flip\n4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSYQWNY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=themasswi0f-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01MSYQWNY&linkId=a2ee8d0d9529a8d854ef53a718b699c7)**\n| $74 | 10 Hrs | 3.5 Hrs  \n**[Anker Soundcore Flare Mini](https://amzn.to/3bQ0SAF)** | $40 | 11.5 Hrs |\n2.5 Hrs  \n**[Sonos\nMove](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7383536-13355209?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fshop%2Fmove-black.html&cjsku=MOVE1US1BLK)** | $399 | 10 Hrs | 2 Hrs  \n**[Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST](https://amzn.to/2OoXTXZ)** | $250 | 15 Hrs |\n2.5Hrs  \n**[Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM 2](https://amzn.to/2N8tKfW)** | $100 | 13 Hrs |\n2.5Hrs  \n**[JBL Clip 3](https://amzn.to/3e9jSuu)** | $70 | 9 Hrs | 2 Hrs  \n**[Bose SoundLink Color\nII](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7383536-13378794?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fspeakers%2Fportable_speakers%2Fsoundlink-\ncolor-bluetooth-speaker-\nii.html%3Fmc%3D25_AF_MU_AO_00_CJ_%23v%3Dsoundlink_color_ii_citron&cjsku=752195-0900)**\n| $129 | 7 Hrs | 3 Hrs  \n**[JBL Charge 4](https://amzn.to/31Ur1wg)** | $180 | 20 Hrs | 5.5 Hrs  \n**[Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM 3](https://amzn.to/2KavpgO)** | $146 | 19.5 Hrs |\n5.5 Hrs  \n**[Bose SoundLink\nRevolve+](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-7383536-13359547?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldwidestereo.com%2Fproducts%2Fbose-\nsoundlink-revolve-plus-bluetooth-speaker%3Fsku%3D168314&cjsku=168314)** | $299\n| 15 Hrs | 4 Hrs  \n**[Bang& Olufsen Beoplay P6](https://amzn.to/3evSY1l)** | $400 | 15 Hrs | 2\nHrs  \n**[Tribit XSound Go](https://amzn.to/2IDu69D)** | $33 | 22 Hrs | 4 Hrs  \n**[DOSS SoundBox Touch](https://amzn.to/2pSFHLs)** | $40 | 10 Hrs | 3 Hrs  \n  \n### **Loudness and Volume**\n\nOne of the most common questions we get about wireless speakers is: How loud\ncan a particular speaker get? It\u2019s not always easy to answer, because \u2018volume\u2019\nis something that is very subjective. It not only depends on who is listening,\nbut the environment they are listening in. However, there is a fairly useful\nway of seeing which speakers can get louder than others. It\u2019s called wattage.\n\nThink about loudness in terms of power: the more powerful the speaker, the\nlouder it will get at a given level of power. Power is measured in watts. The\nmore a speaker has, the louder it will be. The ratings for each of the\nspeakers in our specs table above probably aren't as accurate as they should\nbe (the wattage figures manufacturers give are often subject to wildly varying\ntesting standards) but they work as a guideline. If you were to apply the same\namount of power to the [DOSS SoundBox Touch](https://amzn.to/2pSFHLs) and the\n[Naim Mu-so Qb 2nd Generation](https://amzn.to/3aFjW4k), the former would put\nout 12 watts, and the latter 300 watts. The Naim definitely is the louder,\nmore powerful speaker, but given that it costs nearly $1,000, that's hardly\nsurprising. As you\u2019d imagine, more money often nets you more volume.\n\nOne thing to watch out for is that, at higher volume levels, less expensive\nspeakers often will distort the sound. That\u2019s obviously something you don\u2019t\nwant. We always push speakers to the limit when testing, and if we notice\ndistortion, we\u2019ll mention it in our picks above.\n\n![JBL Bluetooth speakers | The Master\nSwitch](/sites/default/files/Review%20Images/JBL%20Flip%204/JBL-Flip-4---\nComparison-3.jpg)\n\n### **Bass**\n\nIf you were to compare music to food\u2014and why the hell not?\u2014then bass would be\nthe salt. We, as humans, crave it. We seek it out. When listening to music,\nit\u2019s the bass frequencies that give it its rhythm, its kick, its punch. It\u2019s\nwhat gets our heads nodding. It\u2019s the easiest element of the music to zero in\non, and it\u2019s the one that cuts the most clearly across a crowded room, park or\nbeach. If you\u2019re going to buy a Bluetooth speaker, then you will almost\ncertainly be wanting one with good bass, and especially if you plan on using\nyours in crowded environments.\n\nThe thing is, good bass actually is very difficult to do. Bass waves take a\nlot of energy to produce, and small speakers often aren\u2019t capable of doing it\nwell\u2014especially at higher volumes, where it tends to distort. This means that\nfor many small speakers, you\u2019ll be settling for bass that sounds passable at\nmoderate volumes and downright nasty at higher ones. While we believe that all\nthe speakers on our list do an acceptable job of pushing out bass, at the very\nleast, there definitely are some models that treat bass better than others.\nOur top pick for bass is the $250 [Ultimate Ears\nMEGABLAST](https://amzn.to/2OoXTXZ), which offers controlled, powerful, heavy\nbass at all volumes.\n\nAs you may have gathered, the MEGABLAST is a reasonably expensive speaker, and\nfrom that you can probably guess that really good bass does cost a little bit\nextra. That\u2019s an unavoidable fact. To produce good bass, you need high quality\ncomponents and a lot of tuning, and unfortunately that\u2019s something you\u2019ll be\npaying for. If you\u2019re looking for a speaker that treats bass well but doesn\u2019t\ncost quite as much, we\u2019d suggest another UE product, the $100 [WONDERBOOM\n2](https://amzn.to/2N8tKfW). It\u2019s not quite as loud or as powerful as the\nMEGABLAST but does a solid job overall.\n\n![Amazon Echo Dot wireless speaker | The Master\nSwitch](/sites/default/files/Review%20Images/Amazon%20Echo%20Dot%203rd%20Gen/Full\n---Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen.jpg)\n\n### **Voice Assistants: Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant**\n\nMany Bluetooth and wireless speakers contain a voice-activated assistant. They\nallow you to do a staggering number of things with voice commands, from\nplaying music to setting timers, to controlling the lighting in your house.\nVoice assistants\u2014sometimes called smart assistants\u2014are activated with a\nspecific wake word, which varies depending on the assistant. They are\ntremendously versatile, and all have their own positives and negatives. There\nare two main ones we are going to talk about here: Amazon Alexa and Google\nAssistant. While there are others, like Apple\u2019s Siri, Samsung Bixby, and\nMicrosoft Cortana, they are not as widely available and definitely not as\ngood. For the time being, the following assistants are the ones you should be\nlooking at.\n\n#### **Amazon Alexa**\n\nAmazon's virtual assistant is by far the most common, appearing on 4 of the 20\nspeakers on our list. In our opinion, it's definitely not the smartest one\navailable. We have several Alexa devices, both at home and in our office, and\nwhile the assistant does a good job for the most part, we found ourselves\ncontinually running into problems. The biggest issue we had was with smart\nhome integration, where Amazon Echo devices repeatedly refused to recognize\nour SmartThings switches and bulbs, even though the Alexa app\n([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/amazon-\nalexa/id944011620?mt=8)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.dee.app&hl=en_CA))\nworked just fine. We also found it easy to trip Alexa up and it had real\nproblems with follow-up questions.\n\nAlexa does have several advantages over other assistants, however. It has the\nability to recognize different voices, and you can use voice commands to play\nthird-party music services like Spotify and Amazon Music. You can, for\nexample, say \u201cAlexa, play Tupac on Spotify.\u201d Assuming your speaker is\ncompatible, you can also make calls, but you can only receive calls from other\nEcho speakers and someone using the Echo app on a smartphone. You can also add\nthird-party 'skills' to Alexa via the app, which means that the assistant is\ncontinually evolving and getting more useful. And unlike Apple, Amazon is\nquite happy playing nice with other manufacturers. They not only make several\nspeakers of their own, but also let companies like Bose use their assistant.\nThe best Alexa speaker, in our opinion, is the[ Amazon Echo Dot With Clock\n(3rd Gen)](https://amzn.to/34ryMsg). It also happens to be easy on the wallet,\ncosting only $60.\n\n![Google wireless speaker | The Master\nSwitch](/sites/default/files/Review%20Images/Google%20Home%20Hub/Logo---\nGoogle-Home-Hub.jpg)\n\n#### **Google Assistant**\n\nGoogle offer several smart speakers of their own, some of which, including the\n$39 [Google Home\nMini](https://store.google.com/us/product/google_home_mini?hl=en-US) appear on\nour list. The company has what we consider to be the superior voice assistant,\nin terms of intelligence. Google Assistant may not have a catchy name, and is\nsimply activated by saying \"Hey, Google\", but it works. In our tests, it dealt\ncapably with follow-up questions, very rarely tripped up, and almost always\ngave us accurate information.\n\nLike Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant has voice training, allowing it to\nseparate your voice from others, and you can control music streaming services\nlike Spotify with voice commands. You also can make calls, although as of yet,\nyou cannot receive them, something which Alexa can do given the right\ncircumstances. Alexa is more versatile, with its growing library of skills,\nbut hasn't managed to catch up to Google Assistant in terms of smarts. If the\nAI revolution ever happens, Google Assistant will be leading the charge.\n\n![Sonos Wireless Speakers | The Master\nSwitch](/sites/default/files/Review%20Images/SONOS%20One/Play3-Comparison---\nSONOS-One.jpg)\n\n### **Multiroom Wireless Speakers**\n\nReady to step up and do something really interesting with your wireless\nspeakers? How about dotting a few of them throughout your home so that you can\nlisten to music everywhere? It's entirely possible, and given that many of the\nspeakers on this list are inexpensive, it often doesn't have to cost very much\nmoney. There are plenty of advantages to multiroom audio: your partner could\nbe listening to one playlist in the living room, while you shower to another.\nYou can have the same music playing in every room for a party. And usually,\nyou can control everything, including what is playing where, with a single\napp.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to pick up a Sonos speaker, like the top-ranked\n[Sonos One (Gen\n2)](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7383536-13355209?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fshop%2Fone-white.html&cjsku=ONEG2US1). Sonos are known for delivering\ngreat, simple multiroom audio that is a total breeze to set up. The app walks\nyou through every step, including automatically calibrating the speakers for\neach room. However, given that a Sonos One costs $199, this can get expensive\nquickly. If you'd like a significantly cheaper option\u2014like half the price\u2014the\n$74[ JBL Flip\n4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSYQWNY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=themasswi0f-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01MSYQWNY&linkId=a2ee8d0d9529a8d854ef53a718b699c7),\nour top-ranked outdoor/portable speaker, has a feature called JBL Connect that\nlet's you link up to 100 JBL speakers. You may not want to buy quite that\nmany, but it's a great and affordable way to get multiroom audio.\n\n![VIZIO soundbar | The Master\nSwitch](/sites/default/files/Review%20Images/VIZIO%20SB46514-F6/Close----\nVIZIO-SB46514.jpg)\n\n### **Using Bluetooth/Wireless Speakers with your TV**\n\nMost external TV speakers need to be connected directly to your screen, or to\nexisting home theater equipment. But as we know, wires are a pain in the\nbackside, so it\u2019s worth investigating whether or not you can use wireless\naudio with your TV.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is simply to connect to your speakers via\nBluetooth. Many leading TVs allow you to send Bluetooth audio out, and as long\nas you\u2019ve got some speakers that can accept it\u2014which just about every wireless\nspeaker on the market should be able to\u2014you\u2019re in business. You could buy a\npair of [Anker Soundcore Flare Mini](https://amzn.to/2B17A6g) speakers ($80\ntotal) and use them to create stereo audio for your TV. However, Bluetooth\ntransmission has a couple of disadvantages that are worth taking into account.\nThe first is that you will need to regularly charge the speakers or keep them\nconnected to mains power. The second is that Bluetooth audio can sometimes\nsuffer from a bit of lag. That\u2019s not a problem if you\u2019re listening to music,\nbut if you\u2019re trying to sync a soundtrack with a TV picture, even a small\ndelay can cause problems.\n\nYou can buy dedicated wireless home theater speakers, like the [Klipsch\nReference Wireless](https://www.klipsch.com/reference-wireless) system. On the\none hand, this will give you full surround sound with wireless transmission.\nOn the other, it\u2019s hellishly expensive\u2014wireless systems frequently cost\nupwards of $2,000\u2014and you still need to connect each speaker to mains power.\nFor most people, a full wireless surround sound system is overkill.\n\nLet\u2019s propose a slightly more workable option, as mentioned above. That option\nis a soundbar. While you will still need to connect them to your TV with a\nsingle cable, almost all of them are equipped with Bluetooth, meaning you can\nstream music wirelessly, and if the lag doesn\u2019t bother you, TV audio as well.\nWhile the soundbar isn\u2019t technically a wireless speaker in the traditional\nsense, the boundaries are thin enough that we feel comfortable offering them\nas a solution. For the record, our top wireless home theater speaker right now\nis the [Samsung HW-R450](https://amzn.to/2Lptvu9) sound bar, which costs a\nlittle under $180.\n\n![VIZIO Soundbar | The Master\nSwitch](/sites/default/files/Review%20Images/VIZIO%20SB46514-F6/Soundbar%20Side.jpg)\n\n### **Connecting Wireless Speakers to your A/V Receiver**\n\nIf you have an existing home theater setup for your TV, you\u2019ll probably also\nhave an [A/V receiver](https://www.themasterswitch.com/best-av-receivers)\u2014the\nbig, black box which is the hub for all the audio and video in your system.\nBut what if you want to go wireless? What if you want to connect your existing\nwireless speakers to your receiver?\n\nThis is, unfortunately, easier said than done. While almost all current\nreceivers have Bluetooth, none of them\u2014so far as we know\u2014actually transmit\nBluetooth. They can only receive it, which means they cannot send audio\nwirelessly to your existing speakers. There is a workaround for this, which is\nto buy a wireless transmitter, like this [Rocketfish Universal Wireless Rear\nSpeaker Kit](https://amzn.to/3apNsKE). It\u2019s a somewhat pricey solution (that\nparticular product costs $100) but it does work. It allows you to connect the\nwireless transmitter directly to the rear speaker outputs of your receiver,\nand then simply have it transmit Bluetooth to your wireless speakers.\n\nWe\u2019ll be honest: there are better options: either through buying a soundbar,\nlike the $79 [VIZIO SB2920-C6](https://amzn.to/31bUDlV), or by buying a\ndedicated wireless home theater package. The latter can be quite expensive,\nhowever, so proceed with care.\n\n![Naim Mu-so QB 2 wireless speaker | The Master\nSwitch](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/May%2020%20Update/Naim-\nMuso-QB-2-Logo.jpg)\n\n### **Clarifying Key Terms**\n\n#### **Bluetooth**\n\nBluetooth is brilliant. It\u2019s a way of sending data wirelessly from one device\nto another, through direct connection. It relies on an advanced form of radio\nwaves and has become the go-to standard for wireless music. Every smartphone\nhas the ability to transmit Bluetooth, and almost all wireless speakers will\nhave the ability to receive it. Bluetooth is limited by the amount of data it\ncan transmit in a signal, and it\u2019s also limited by distance\u2014anything over\nabout 30 feet between source and playback device, and the signal will start to\ndrop out. But for the most part, Bluetooth is simple to use, available\neverywhere, and sounds great.\n\n####  \n**Wi-Fi**\n\nWi-Fi refers to the network in your home that allows you to access the\nInternet. A speaker that is Wi-Fi enabled will connect directly to this\nnetwork, and be able to take advantage of the faster speeds and higher data\nthan you\u2019d find on a typical Bluetooth network. Be warned: unlike Bluetooth,\nwhich is a direct connection between two devices, a Wi-Fi network can serve\nseveral devices at once. This means that if there are too many devices on the\nnetwork, it can become overloaded, which can mean dropouts and laggy audio.\nDespite that little problem, Wi-Fi audio remains a terrific way to listen to\nmusic at home. Our top wireless speaker, the [Sonos\nOne](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7383536-13355209?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fshop%2Fone-white.html&cjsku=ONEG2US1), is Wi-Fi enabled.\n\n####  \n**Multiroom**\n\nMultiroom audio refers to a set of speakers in different rooms of your house,\nall connected to a single network, such as your Wi-Fi network. You can either\nhave the speakers play the same music at the same time, or you can arrange\nthings so that different songs are playing in different rooms. Companies like\nSonos make doing this extremely easy by offering simple smartphone apps.\nMultiroom music used to be incredibly difficult to do, and required lots of\nspeaker wire and fiddling with stereo receivers. But with wireless and\nBluetooth speakers, it\u2019s a breeze. One thing to note: it\u2019s very difficult to\nset up a multiroom system with Bluetooth. You could theoretically do it using\nsomething like the [JBL Flip\n4\u2019s](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSYQWNY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=themasswi0f-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01MSYQWNY&linkId=a2ee8d0d9529a8d854ef53a718b699c7)\nConnect+ app, which allows you to change speakers, but it\u2019s a clunky\nworkaround. A far better option would be to use a Wi-Fi-enabled speaker.\n\n![Sonos wireless and Bluetooth speaker | The Master\nSwitch](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/May%2020%20Update/Sonos-\nSpeakers.jpg)\n\n#### **Voice Control**\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible nowadays to control your speaker by, well, speaking to\nit. Virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant come preloaded\non many of the speakers on our list (check the table above for full details).\nThese assistants allow you to play and pause music, and find playlists,\nartists and albums on your preferred music service. They can also perform\nbasic Internet searches, check the weather, set alarms, and more.\n\nTypically, you\u2019ll activate them by using a \u2018wake word,\u2019 which a preset voice\ncommand that tells them to start listening. And while there are significant\nprivacy concerns\u2014you are, after all, inviting an Internet connected microphone\ninto your life\u2014you always can manually deactivate this microphone. For the\nmost part, we think voice control is a useful feature but it\u2019s not essential,\nespecially if you plan on using your portable Bluetooth speaker in a public\nplace. While most speakers will have both Alexa and Google Assistant, some\nwill only have one, like the [Amazon Echo Dot With Clock (3rd\nGen)](https://amzn.to/34ryMsg), for example.\n\n####  \n**DNLA**\n\nTake a look at your home Wi-Fi network. Chances are, all the devices on it are\nmade by different people. Your TV might be made by Samsung, your wireless\nspeaker by JBL, your phone by Apple, and so on. All of these pieces of\nhardware use different software programs, and getting them to talk to each\nother can be tricky. That\u2019s where DLNA comes in. It is the name of both an\norganization (the Digital Living Network Alliance) and the product that\norganization makes, a wireless protocol that allows different devices to talk\nto each other.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: we are going to recommend you don\u2019t use DLNA on your\nwireless speakers. You will often see it advertised, to be sure, sometimes as\na prominent feature. But there are, quite simply, better ways for speakers to\ntalk to source devices. Technology has advanced to the point where most\nspeakers will be able to communicate over a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth network without\na third-party protocol like DLNA. DLNA also happens to be a pain to use and\nwe\u2019ve experienced frequent dropouts in the past. If you want one more nail in\nthe coffin, iPhones don\u2019t use it. Apple does not participate in DLNA\ncertification, which means that common iPhone features like AirPlay are a no-\ngo.\n\n![Naim Mu-so QB 2 wireless speaker | The Master\nSwitch](/sites/default/files/Roundup%20Images/Wireless%20Speakers/May%2020%20Update/Naim-\nMuso-QB-2-Panel.jpg)\n\n#### **NFC**\n\nNFC is something you may run across occasionally while shopping for Bluetooth\nspeakers. It refers to Near-Field Communication and essentially lets you\nconnect to devices over Bluetooth by quite literally holding them next to each\nother. The problem is, in the world of wireless speakers, it\u2019s not very\ncommon. Some speakers, like the $129 [Bose SoundLink Color\nII](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7383536-13378794?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fspeakers%2Fportable_speakers%2Fsoundlink-\ncolor-bluetooth-speaker-\nii.html%3Fmc%3D25_AF_MU_AO_00_CJ_%23v%3Dsoundlink_color_ii_citron&cjsku=752195-0900),\ndo use it, and it certainly does simplify things, but it\u2019s not worth hunting\nit down as a feature. In addition, it won\u2019t work with iPhones or any other\nApple devices. Somewhat inevitably, Apple has its own version that allows its\ndevices to talk to each other.\n\n####  \n**AirPlay**\n\nApple famously does not play nice with others (see above). You can get an idea\nof this by understanding how they get their phones and tablets to transmit\nmusic. While these devices are capable of Bluetooth, the easiest way to send\naudio from them is to use AirPlay 2, a proprietary tech that sends high\nquality audio over a Wi-Fi network. To be fair, many Bluetooth speakers accept\nAirPlay streams, so if you own an iPhone, this can be an effective and\nstraightforward way to start playing music. Be warned though: it does make\nspeakers more expensive, as Apple charges manufacturers quite a bit to use it.\n\n####  \n**aptX**\n\nBluetooth audio is great, but it has a limitation: namely, the amount of data\nit can transmit at a time. Those data limitations mean that sound quality\nsometimes suffers. aptX It essentially is a way of supercharging your\nBluetooth string: a method of packaging more data into the stream, and sending\nit fast. If you\u2019re into high resolution sound quality, and you want to listen\nto things over Bluetooth, then we strongly recommend investigating aptX and\nits cousin, aptX HD. It\u2019s relatively simple to use, although you will need to\nmake sure that both your source device (like your phone) and your wireless\nspeaker are capable of using it. As you\u2019d expect, it\u2019s most commonly found on\nmore expensive speakers, and by more expensive, we often mean upwards of $500.\nIf you were to buy the $990 [Naim Mu-so Qb 2nd\nGeneration](https://amzn.to/3aFjW4k), you\u2019d have access to it, but if you were\nto go for either of the Sonos speakers on our list, you wouldn\u2019t.\n\nBack To Our Bluetooth and Wireless Speaker Picks Back To Our Comparison Table\n\nPowered by [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org)\n\n## Learn More About Speakers\n\n[![Best Computer\nSpeakers](/sites/default/files/styles/image_340_225/public/images/articles/Computer-\nSpeakers-%28S%29_0.jpg?h=fbc67360&itok=T1Pbyxen) ](/best-computer-speakers)\n\n###  [Best Computer Speakers of 2020 ](/best-computer-speakers)\n\nWhether you need a pair of low-profile desk speakers for everyday use, or a\nmassive 5.1 surround sound setup for some serious dungeon crawling, you've\ncome to the right place.
