Regardless of the small size, it\u2019s an audio powerhouse that delivers\nvery accurately reproduced sounds. The speaker balances the audio, so you\nwon\u2019t hear one noise over the other.

It\u2019s also quite stylish.\n\n**Editor\u2019s rating:**\n\nThis sleek and stylish Bluetooth speaker is designed in Scandinavia, a region\nfamous for music (ABBA anyone?). This speaker is definitely designed for music\nlovers. The unit can reproduce sound with amazing clarity that is quite\nsurprising for a wireless speaker. The sounds are rich and well-balanced. The\nspeaker reproduces truly excellent highs. The bass isn\u2019t bad either, despite\nthe lack of a subwoofer speaker.

It even comes with its own SDK!\n\n**Editor\u2019s rating:**\n\nThis Creative iRoar is the Buffy the Vampire Slayer of Bluetooth speakers. In\nthat it looks small and inconspicuous but is surprisingly loud and powerful.\nYou can hold this speaker in one hand, but it can still fill up a room with\nbooming music. It works with computers, tablets, and just about anything that\ncan play music, and it connects via Bluetooth. We\u2019ve never seen a speaker this\nversatile. You can connect this speaker via a USB or an optical audio port as\nwell. The speaker itself has a built-in media player that can play music\nstored on a microSD card.\n\nWhile this Bluetooth speaker offers many connections and comes with a\ncorresponding smartphone app, the deciding factor you may care about is, of\ncourse, the sound. As mentioned before, it can blast music at high volume. But\nthe speaker reduces audio distortions and noise, so you can experience crisp\nand clear sound. Simply put, the audio is phenomenal. The speaker delivers\nlows, mids, highs, and bass very accurately. You can easily use this speaker\nwith a home entertainment system.

This speaker is optimized for wireless\nhome entertainment systems. It can be connected to a multi-room home\nentertainment network like AirPlay or Sonos. This speaker works with both\nBluetooth and streaming Wi-Fi. It\u2019s rare for a speaker to connect in both\nmanners, so for that, the Zipp stands out. You can connect over a dozen other\nspeakers to this one, creating a giant audio network in your home. If you like\nthrowing house parties or enjoy surround sound when watching TV, then this is\nthe speaker for you.\n\nA Zipp unit is quite inexpensive, so you can create a network with just these.\nBut we think the mini speaker is best used for individuals who want to\nprivately listen to music. If you are connecting to a voice-activated personal\nassistant like Siri, this speaker would be a great choice. It\u2019s compact, so it\ndoesn\u2019t require much space. As for audio, it\u2019s surprisingly powerful for a\nsmall speaker. Audio is solid across the spectrum, so you won\u2019t get too much\nbass or too much treble. Also, the speaker can shift to speakerphone, an added\nconvenience for busy homemakers.\n\nrelated_post\n\nSee more\n\n## JBL Clip 2\n\n[ ![Product Info](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41gu1wmjFML._SL160_.jpg)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WW9T1C4?tag=isbestseekers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Product Info\")\n\n[ Product Info\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WW9T1C4?tag=isbestseekers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Product Info\")\n\n  * This Certified Refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new.

The top of\nthe speaker has a small rectangular carabiner that you can use to secure the\nspeaker to a top. So this is basically a speaker you can travel around with\nlike headphones. Except that there\u2019s no hassle with wires, and you can blast\nmusic for multiple people to hear. Obviously, this wireless speaker is\nextremely portable, and you can fix it on tent loops or backpacks on outings.\n\nThe audio is not miniature just because the speaker is small. While you won\u2019t\nget booming bass as with a bigger speaker, this tiny gadget can faithfully\nreproduce well-balanced audio tones. You can listen to clear and crisp audio.\nWe recommend this speaker highly to audiobook lovers because of the higher\nclarity and size. The Clip 2 is water resistant too, so you can wear it while\ndoing the dishes or while canoeing in a river. Another big advantage of Clip 2\nis that it\u2019s highly affordable. So when it comes to the size and price ratio,\nthis is one of the best Bluetooth speakers around.\n\n## Best Bluetooth Speakers \u2013 Buyer\u2019s Guide\n\nFreedom from wires is a marvellous development, not only for music listeners,\nbut for speaker designers as well. Making the transition from older music\nequipment may feel somewhat unusual, since Bluetooth speakers often present\nfeatures in different ways.\n\nTo help develop a Bluetooth vocabulary, let\u2019s look at how Bluetooth devices\napproach concepts in audio playback. Review these before you hit the stores,\nonline or downtown.\n\n### Stereo vs. Mono\n\nThe idea of portability dictates that a wireless, go-anywhere speaker should\nbe a single unit. Since the 1950s, stereo sound has dominated popular music.\nStereos take advantage of the way our ears hear to create three-dimensional\nsounds. To accomplish this, two speaker sets play coordinated musical\nprograms. Think about headphones for a minute and you\u2019ll get the idea.\n\nHome stereos were traditionally permanent fixtures and large pieces of\nfurniture. The listener would set up a stereo with speakers in a fixed\nposition relative to where the music would be enjoyed, generally a triangle\nwith equal distances between speakers and listener. Such an arrangement\npreserves the stereo image when playing music back.\n\nThere are three approaches that Bluetooth speakers follow. The most basic is\nthe speaker that sums left and right audio, and plays back as mono sound from\na single unit. Since a single unit design is common to many of the best\nBluetooth speakers, this provides all the audio from a stereo track in a\nsingle source.\n\nOther Bluetooth speakers preserve left and right output, mini stereos in a\nsingle unit. These could be front-facing or shot out of the sides. You\u2019d have\nto be relatively close to the speakers to perceive any stereo picture, but\nit\u2019s a step up from a point source.\n\nThe last approach is a Bluetooth speaker that operates as a single source\nuntil you connect a second unit. Some models permit left and right signal\nseparation. If stereo imaging is important to you, then this is the way to go.\n\n### Frequency Response\n\nOne of the characteristics the manufacturers like to throw around is frequency\nresponse. This is largely a red herring, however. Here\u2019s why: the human ear\nis, on average, able to discern sounds from 20 to 20,000 Hz (20 kHz). The spec\nyou\u2019ll see most often is \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 20Hz to 20kHz. Occasionally,\nyou\u2019ll see speakers with other numbers, perhaps 50Hz to 18kHz.\n\nThe tendency for consumers who know nothing about audio is to think that 50 Hz\nto 18 kHz is not as good as 20Hz to 20kHz. If all speakers were measured the\nsame way, that would be true. However, listing a frequency range says only one\nthing: the speaker will reproduce those frequencies. It says nothing about how\nefficiently the speaker works. If a manufacturer gives numbers other than 20\nto 20k, they are referring to the effectively flat portion of the speaker\u2019s\nresponse. In other words, you\u2019re getting more useful information and a better\nspeaker.\n\nWhile deep notes can go to 20Hz and below, 50 to 65Hz is around the lowest\nthat we perceive. Below that, any output starts to interfere with \u201cgood\u201d bass.\nYou may be surprised to find that some of the deepest tracks have virtually no\ncontent under 50Hz.\n\nIt\u2019s similar on the top end as well, but for different reasons. Hearing\ndeclines over time and it\u2019s high frequencies that go first. When you\u2019re young,\n20kHz is almost a sensation, rather than a sound, but as hearing diminish,\n20kHz is not even heard. Even if a speaker is putting out 20kHz with\nefficiency, most listeners won\u2019t hear it.\n\nFrequency response is largely a false statistic. Trust your ears when you\nlisten, not the paper.\n\n### Bluetooth Versions\n\nAnyone who tried Bluetooth products a few years ago may recall bad sound and\nfrequent interference. This stemmed largely from low bandwidth, meaning that\nto successfully stream audio, aggressive compression had to occur. This\naffected sound quality and made for poor playback conditions.\n\nWhen Bluetooth 2.1 hit, it added a feature called Enhanced Data Rate.\nEssentially, it was a way of tucking more information into a Bluetooth signal\nalongside existing data. The result was faster data transfer and less need for\ncompression.\n\nSince then there have been additional improvements, and quality issues are\ngone if you\u2019re using 2.1 EDR or later. Most contemporary Bluetooth speakers\nmeet this mark, but make sure you find it; it\u2019s a much more useful spec than\nfrequency response for ensuring high quality.\n\n### Bluetooth Speaker Glossary\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at features and terms used to describe the best Bluetooth\nspeakers.\n\n**Water Resistance:** Some Bluetooth speakers boast IP codes. These are\nstandards for dust, dirt, and water resistance, indicating how tough a\nparticular unit is. These codes change over time, with a two-digit code used\ncurrently. Taking the form of \u201cIP66,\u201d the first digit represents protection\nagainst solid objects and the second shows water resistance. The higher each\nnumber is, the better.\n\n**Speakerphone Functions**  \nSince many Bluetooth speakers act as playback devices for smartphones, they\nalso have features that answer calls and act as a hands-free speakerphone.\n\n**NFC:** Discussed in greater depth below, NFC stands for Near Field\nCommunication, which is the technology behind tap-and-pay credit and debit\ncards. For Bluetooth speakers, it\u2019s predominately used to establish the link;\nsimply hold your music device near an NFC-enabled Bluetooth speaker and the\ntwo become tethered.\n\n**Additional Ports \u2013 USB and 3.5mm:** Some Bluetooth speaker devices permit\ncharging of other products. Not only can your speaker play music, it can\nextend your smartphone\u2019s battery life. That comes at a cost to the speaker\u2019s\ncharge, but the extra charging capability comes in handy.\n\nDevices with 3.5mm jacks usually, but not always, allow input of an auxiliary\ndevice. For example, you can use an older iPod or MP3 player to feed your\nBluetooth speaker. In other cases, the 3.5mm jack may be used to connect an\nadditional speaker.\n\n**Battery Life:** You\u2019ll probably have more trouble keeping your smartphone\ncharged than you will a Bluetooth speaker. Not only are speakers larger than\nphones, they\u2019re also heftier. Batteries provide a natural weight, and the\nbigger the battery, the longer the charge.\n\n### Differences Between Bluetooth, NFC and Wi-Fi\n\nEach of these technologies deal with wireless data transfer. Each has its own\nstrengths and capabilities.\n\n**NFC:** Near Field Communication depends on close proximity of devices. Its\nrange is under two inches. Also used in contactless payment systems, NFC is\npractical in wireless speakers if a user regularly places their smartphone\nnear the speaker, for example. This closeness gives NFC an inherent security,\nsince data is only possible between compatible devices at very short\ndistances. File sharing of photos and videos between friends or playing games\nin close proximity is possible with minimal effort. Not all manufacturers\nincorporate NFC due to its expense. This aids security, but limits\ncompatibility.\n\n**Bluetooth:** Range and data rate place Bluetooth in the middle of the\nwireless connection pack. With a maximum range of 30 meters, or about 98 feet,\nBluetooth is very suitable for use with wireless speakers. Bluetooth 4.0\noffers data transfer up to 25mbps, though earlier versions are fine for\nstreaming compressed audio. Bluetooth connections electronically match keys in\na simple process. It\u2019s not an inherently secure data transfer platform, but\nits short range of transmission offsets this weakness. Its power consumption\nis much leaner than Wi-Fi, extending battery life for wireless audio\nstreaming. As well as wireless speakers, Bluetooth has many other applications\nfor short-range devices. Computers and laptops now add Bluetooth capability,\nand the medical field adopts its use to add portability and wireless\nconnectivity. This extends the usability of smaller diagnostic equipment,\nwhich can now move room-to-room efficiently.\n\n**Wi-Fi:** Data transfer capability for Wi-Fi is potentially 10 times that of\nBluetooth, a bit of an overkill situation for compressed music streaming. Data\nrange is about three times that of Bluetooth, in the neighborhood of 328 feet.\nAgain, that\u2019s a bit more than what\u2019s commonly needed for wireless speaker use.\nWi-Fi security can be far more robust, supporting a variety of encryption\nmethods. Connecting devices over Wi-Fi can also be much more complex than\nBluetooth. Wi-Fi power consumption isn\u2019t practical for portable wireless\nspeakers, where extended listening time is a common selling point. Wi-Fi\nDirect is more akin to Bluetooth in terms of a short distance wireless\ntransfer protocol. Holding many of the advantages of Wi-Fi, it has lower power\nconsumption. To date, it\u2019s not been used much in consumer audio, since\nBluetooth is already so pervasive.\n\nRate This Post\n\nLoading...\n\n[![](https://bestseekers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parrotzik-80x80.jpg)\n\nBest Wireless Bluetooth Headphones\n\nPrevious review](https://bestseekers.com/best-wireless-bluetooth-headphones/)\n\n[Best Clothes Steamers\n\nNext review ![](https://bestseekers.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Best-\nclothes-steamers-80x80.png)](https://bestseekers.com/best-clothes-steamers/)\n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/best-bluetooth-speakers/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.
