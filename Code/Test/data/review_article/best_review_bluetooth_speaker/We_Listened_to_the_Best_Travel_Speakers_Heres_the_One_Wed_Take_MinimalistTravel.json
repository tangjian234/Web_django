It has since been\nupdated every few months with additions, changed recommendations, and new\nproducts, and also had a few major overhauls. On April 14, 2017, we started\nlogging these changes here; we added the UE Wonderboom to the recommended\ncheaper speakers. On May 3, 2017 we made a few changes and added the Etekcity\nRoverBeats T3. On May 8, 2017 we added the CRDC Life. On May June 2, 2017 we\nadded a discussion of the JBL Flip 4 and made a few other updates. On June 21,\n2017 we updated the discussion of the CRDC Life. On August 11, 2017, we\nupdated the information on the Fugoo and Bose Soundlink Revolve speakers. On\nAugust 15-16, 2017, we removed speakers that were no longer available, updated\nthe descriptions of our main pick, added some great alternate recommendations\nthat have been recently released. We also rewrote the dumb parts. On Nov. 2,\n2017, we added the AOSM speaker. On Nov. 3, we added the Bose Soundlink Micro.\nOn Nov. 7, 2017, we added the supercheap tiniest speaker. On July 18-20, 2017,\nwe did a major overhaul of the whole article with some updated recommendations\nconcerning new speakers and eliminating those that are no longer available. On\nJuly 22. 2018: removed the no-longer-available the AOSM Portable TWS Bluetooth\nspeaker, CRDC Life and Etekcity RoverBeats T3. Complete overhaul with updated\nrecommendations on October 23, 2018. April 8, 2018: Updated with more opinions\non the sound of the Boom 3 and better photos.\n\n## Why the UE Boom 3 Is Our Favorite Travel Speaker (And Why Others Think So\nToo)\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss its main road-worthy features first, then its sound \u2014 including\na meta-take on critics views of this versus other portable speakers.\n\n![](https://minimalist.travel/wp-\ncontent/uploads/00000img_00000_burst20190402093856924_cover5802466805964584145-251x335.jpg)We\ntested the waterproofing of the Ultimate Ears Boom 3 in a bathtub. No problems\nfound. Let\u2019s be honest; there\u2019s really no reason to have it in the tub with\nyou, but it is nice to know that it\u2019s plenty well built to take any road\nabuse.\n\n### Features of the UE Boom 3: Rugged, Ready to Travel\n\nThis is not a feature-rich speaker, but it does include everything we find\nessential for use anywhere.\n\n#### Waterproof, dustproof, drop-proof\n\nNo you\u2019re not actually going to listen to your speaker underwater. But with\nthe Ultimate Ears Boom 3, you could. The IP67 waterproof rating means that the\nunit is rated to be immersed under a meter of water for up to 30 minutes with\nno damage. This is a specific and meaningful claim (with legal implications)\nunder the conditions of the [International Electrotechnical Commission\u2019s\nstandards](http://www.iec.ch/).\n\nIn our test it sounds fine in the bathtub, but really, just put it next to\nyour bath, shower, or pool. We do like knowing that we can easily wash it when\nneeded, and that the odd splash of water won\u2019t hurt it, but the 7 rating in\nwaterproofing (meaning it can be submerged) is a bit overkill.\n\nThe 6 in the rating also means that it is \u201cdustproof\u201d and meets the standards\nfor keeping dust out of the unit \u2014 an extra level of protection that is rare\nin such speakers, even those that are rated as waterproof.\n\nThe \u201cdrop-proofing\u201d is a vaguer claim from Ultimate Ears that meets no\nspecific standards, but the company claims that the Boom 3 passed various drop\nand durability tests. We were not so interested in testing this particular\nclaim, but clumsier Amazon reviewers report that they\u2019ve [dropped it with no\nproblems or even scratches](https://amzn.to/2IlSZHN). (The same was reported\nwith its [predecessor UE Boom 2](https://amzn.to/2zX7ijq).) And prior to\npicking up a Boom 3, I myself was using, dropping, and bumping an (ancient-\nmodel, long discontinued) UE Mini speaker from the same manufacturer for many,\nmany years and to this day it plays perfectly. The battery still works great\ntoo.\n\n####  Convenient Charging and a 15-hour Battery for Long Parties Away from a\nPower Source\n\nThis is not the longest battery life for a quality small travel speaker (the\nFugoo Tough described below goes for 40 hours) but the Boom 3 has more battery\ntime than most reasonable people will ever need. (We also recommend carrying a\n[backup battery for our devices](https://minimalist.travel/en/reviews/usb-c-\nbattery-chromebook-plus/) when on the road, which could be used to charge your\nspeaker in a pinch.) The Boom 3 lasts for 15 hours of constant use. In the\nreal world, I used it without charging for a two-week trip that included\nseveral spurts of use in (3-4-hour) car trips, and use in hotel rooms,\nshowers, little improvised dance parties, and more with more battery to spare\nat the end.\n\n![](https://minimalist.travel/wp-\ncontent/uploads/IMG_20190402_100630-251x335.jpg)The Ultimate Ears Boom 3\u2019s\nUSB-A to USB-B cable plugs into any standard USB charger, such as one of the\nports on the [travel adapter and USB\ncharger](https://minimalist.travel/en/reviews/best-power-adapter/) that we\nrecommend, shown here.\n\n![](https://minimalist.travel/wp-\ncontent/uploads/IMG_20190402_100714-251x335.jpg)The Boom 3\u2019s provided USB\ncable is long enough to be useful for reaching to plug it in behind furniture\nor in odd places in a hotel for charging. It\u2019s sturdy enough to hold up over\ntime on the road.\n\nIt\u2019s also convenient that this speaker charges via a standard mini USB-B port,\nso it\u2019s easy to borrow a charger from someone\u2019s phone if you haven\u2019t brought\nthe Boom 3\u2019s (included) cable and plug with you.\n\n![](https://minimalist.travel/wp-\ncontent/uploads/00100dportrait_00100_burst20190402093720071_cover7001603685898137224-e1554220876967-335x312.jpg)The\nUltimate Ears Boom 3 can be charged with any standard micro USB-B cable, like\nwhat most cell phones charged with up until a few years ago, and what plenty\nof smaller devices still use to charge.\n\n __\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G7PCTDT?tag=selecto-\naawp-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Ultimate Ears Charging Dock\") [Ultimate Ears\nCharging Dock](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G7PCTDT?tag=selecto-\naawp-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Ultimate Ears Charging Dock\") $17.99\n\nThe other power option is an optional [charging\ndock](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G7PCTDT?tag=selecto-\naawp-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"charging dock\"), which we think is a very\nlovely way to display and listen to your Boom 3 at home. You simply plop the\nspeaker down on this stand and it starts charging. Super convenient, though\nit\u2019s also a bit overpriced.\n\n#### Hang Loop\n\n![](https://minimalist.travel/wp-\ncontent/uploads/00100dportrait_00100_burst20190402093707267_cover6483784990923685521-e1554221742767-216x335.jpg)The\nUltimate Ears Boom 3 in my masculine though hardly enormous hand (to give an\nidea of size). It\u2019s a 2.9 inch diameter speaker that\u2019s 7.2 inches tall. I\ncarry it in a drinks sleeve in my pack, and the drinks slot when I\u2019m using it\nin a car.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen our commentary on [toiletry\nkits](https://minimalist.travel/en/reviews/best-small-toiletry-bag-review/),\nyou know that we\u2019re obsessed with the utility of being able to hang things\nwhile travelling, and staying in cramped quarters.\n\n __\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072NCYVQK?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Gold Lion Gear Aluminum Carabiner D Shape\nBuckle Pack, Keychain Clip, Spring Snap Key Chain Clip Hook Screw Gate Buckle\n-Pack of Assorted Color Carabiners \\(Black, 5 Locking Carabiners\\)\") [Gold\nLion Gear Aluminum Carabiner D Shape\nBuckle...](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072NCYVQK?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Gold Lion Gear Aluminum Carabiner D Shape\nBuckle Pack, Keychain Clip, Spring Snap Key Chain Clip Hook Screw Gate Buckle\n-Pack of Assorted Color Carabiners \\(Black, 5 Locking Carabiners\\)\") $8.94\n\nYou can use a [carabiner](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072NCYVQK?tag=select-\nmeta-bluetooth-speaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"carabiner\") to attach your\nUltimate Ears Boom 3\u2019s hang loop to a backpack, a fence, a chair, a towel hook\nwhen you\u2019re the shower\u2026 this is a very small but incredibly convenient\nfeature. At least I think so; I always seem to run out of space to set stuff\nout on when I\u2019m staying in weird corners of the world.\n\n#### The Boom 3\u2019s Dedicated Apps: Equalizer, Pair Multiple Speakers, and More\n\nYou can use the Ultimate Ears Boom 3 without installing any special apps as a\nsimple Bluetooth-connected speaker. But you\u2019ll want the relevant\n[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.logitech.ueboom&hl=en)\nor [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ue-boom/id632344648?mt=8) app for\nyour phone as they add quite a bit of functionality.\n\n  * The \u201cblock party\u201d features allows three people to share/fight for DJ-rights to the speaker.\n  * You can remotely turn the speaker on and off, which turns out to be quite convenient for making sure you save battery when the speaker is a bit further than you\u2019d like to reach, or for turning it on to find it by sound if misplaced.\n  * Customize the EQ to your taste.\n  * Use the speaker as a musical alarm.\n  * Connect multiple Boom 3 speakers for bigger sound. You can also connect 150+ Ultimate Ears Boom, Boom 2, Megaboom, and Megaboom 3 and have them all blasting music from your little old phone.\n\n#### Portable Size and Weight\n\n![](https://minimalist.travel/wp-\ncontent/uploads/IMG_20190402_094249-251x335.jpg)The Boom 3 can be carried in\nthe water bottle pocket of your pack or daypack, and is shown here in the\n[daypack](https://minimalist.travel/en/reviews/osprey-daypacks-compared-\ndaylite-tempest-talon-hikelite-tropos-talia-nova-nebula/) of the [Osprey\nMeridian 60](https://minimalist.travel/en/reviews/rolling-carry-on-backpack/).\n\nThe Boom 3 is a very packable 2.9-in. (7.3 cm.) diameter cylinder and is 7.2\nin. (18.4 cm.) tall. It weighs 1.34 lbs. (608 g.).\n\nWant to travel even lighter? We totally understand. In that case opt instead\nfor the Bose Soundlink Micro described below.\n\n#### The Feature It Lacks: The Boom 3 Is Not a Smart Speaker, So Talk to Your\nPhone Instead\n\nIf you want a speaker you can chat with (ask about the weather, news, control\na smart home), you can see our\n[comparison](https://selectoguru.com/us/reviews/ultimate-ears-blast-vs-ue-\nboom-2/) with the [Ultimate Ears\nBlast](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075JR68VX?tag=selecto-\naawp-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Ultimate Ears Blast\"). But note that we\nwouldn\u2019t really bother recommending _any_ smart speaker, at least in terms of\ntravel, as all smart speakers currently only work when connected to WiFi.\n\n __\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073SQYXTW?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Echo Spot\") [Echo\nSpot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073SQYXTW?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Echo Spot\") $79.19\n\nWe also think that smart speakers are a bit gimmicky and not all that useful;\nif you want an assistant we\u2019d go instead for a (much more useful, nearly\nessential) screen on a unit like the [Echo\nSpot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073SQYXTW?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Echo Spot\"),\n[Show](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077SXWSRP?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Show\") or [Google Home\nHub](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-home-hub-with-google-assistant-\nchalk/6290313.p?skuId=6290313) for your home, and get a separate durable\nspeaker for the road.\n\n### How the UE Boom 3 Sounds\n\nOur top-pick travel speaker [Ultimate Ears Boom\n3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DD3VXRZ?tag=selecto-\naawp-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Ultimate Ears Boom 3\") is, as you may\nsuspect, the third in a series. The previous UE Boom and UE Boom 2\n[were](http://www.trustedreviews.com/ue-boom-2-review)\n[both](https://www.whathifi.com/ultimate-ears/boom/review) [revolutionary\n](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/hi-fi-and-audio/hi-fi-and-av-\nspeakers/ue-boom-1291303/review)[hits](https://www.cnet.com/products/ue-\nboom-2/) [with](https://youtu.be/eELisPqno2s)\n[reviewers](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ue-boom-2-bluetooth-\nspeaker,review-3059.html) [when](http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-\nvisual/hi-fi-and-audio/hi-fi-and-av-speakers/ue-boom-2-1311342/review)\n[released](https://www.whathifi.com/ultimate-ears/boom-2/review)\n[with](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/review-ue-boom-2/)\n[tech](https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/15/9325775/logitech-ultimate-ears-ue-\nboom-2-announced) [press](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-bluetooth-\nspeaker/), [audiophiles](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2015/10/ue-\nboom-2-australian-review/), and international\n[consumer](http://www.which.co.uk/reviews/wireless-and-bluetooth-\nspeakers/ultimate-ears-ue-boom-2/review) and\n[testing](https://www.quechoisir.org/comparatif-enceinte-bluetooth-n817/)\norganizations. These were the first speakers to really do 360-degree audio and\nthey packed an incredible punch for their small size.\n\nThe competition has caught up, definitely, and plenty of other portable\nBluetooth speakers sound wonderful. But the [Boom 3 has improved over the Boom\n2 too](https://selectoguru.com/us/reviews/ue-boom-2-vs-ultimate-ears-boom-3/).\nThus far [the](https://gizmodo.com/the-ue-boom-3-is-good-redesign-at-its-\nbest-1828950396) [critics](http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/ue/1407679/ultimate-\nears-boom-3-review-boom-2-successor)\n[have](https://www.wired.com/review/ultimate-ears-boom-3-megaboom-3/)\n[been](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/ue-boom-3-preview/)\n[heaping](https://www.whathifi.com/reviews/ultimate-ears-boom-3) praise on the\nnew portable party guy from Ultimate Ears, saying that its sound has a bit\nbetter performance at top volumes. Since speaker tastes are subjective, our\nmeta-take is always to look for an overall consensus in this way rather than\ntaking just our ears or any other one critic\u2019s tastes as gospel.\n\nAnd overall the experts think that the Boom 3 sounds fantastic. Its 2-inch\ndrivers and 2\u00d74-inch passive radiators punch out powerful sound and relatively\n**deep bass** for such a small unit with little risk of distortion. It\u2019s an\nimpressive feat of engineering and it doesn\u2019t \u2014 like certain competitors, hike\nup the bass end to try to cover sloppy performance. The sound is balanced and\nrich, clear and sweet in the mids, and often described as \u201cpunchy\u201d or\n\u201cdynamic\u201d.\n\n![](https://minimalist.travel/wp-\ncontent/uploads/00100dportrait_00100_burst20190402093553674_cover7206390758730351326.jpg)The\nUltimate Ears Boom 3 pictured in action, filling a 400-square-foot living room\nand dining room area with plenty of sound. It was still a bit too much at top\nvolume, in fact, and we had to turn it down.\n\nOf the many Bluetooth speakers that I\u2019ve personally listened to, the Ultimate\nEars Boom 3 is the best sounding of its size, and certainly has the most\nconvincing bass \u2014 not quite as deep and pleasing as high-end home bookshelf\nspeakers, but it\u2019s getting well close, which to my mind is fantastic for\nsomeone who is rarely in my living room enough to enjoy those.\n\nThe speaker **goes quite loud** (up to 90 dBA) and doesn\u2019t have issues with\ndistortion or odd mix effects when it gets up to its limits. Pushed to the max\nit was uncomfortably loud in a large interior living room/dining area, and\ncould certainly serve as the sound system for a house party if needed.\n\nAlso crucial for good sound in practical outdoor settings or larger rooms is\nthe UE Boom 3\u2019s **360-degree output**. No matter which side of the speaker\nyou\u2019re on, it sounds the same. The speaker is designed to be placed in the\ncenter of the action, and be equally enjoyable from any side. This means you\ncan take a party to go and place the speaker in the center of the action, and\nit will sound great to everyone.\n\n### Downsides of the UE Boom 3 (But Not Enough to Hold Us Back)\n\n  * There is always a trade-off between a speaker\u2019s size and its ability to deliver convincing bass and volume, so of course some larger Bluetooth speakers do sound better especially on the bass end. In this article we focus on portable units and compare the Boom 3\u2019s sound to them; we separately cover the [bigger, less portable Bluetooth speakers here](https://selectoguru.com/us/reviews/big-loudest-bluetooth-speakers/). The Boom 3 is to most ears the best-sounding speaker with the features and the size that a traveller wants, but you might also [compare it to the Megaboom 3](https://selectoguru.com/us/reviews/ultimate-ears-boom-3-vs-megaboom-3/) if you\u2019re willing to carry about twice the weight.\n  * It\u2019s a bit expensive. You can certainly spend less and still have a great-sounding and robustly durable travel speaker (see below).\n\n### Buying Options for the UE Boom 3 and Scoring the Best Prices\n\n __\n\n[ ![Ultimate Ears Boom 3](https://minimalist.travel/wp-\ncontent/plugins/aawp/public/assets/img/thumb-spacer.png)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DD3VXRZ?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Ultimate Ears Boom 3\")\n\n[ Ultimate Ears Boom 3 ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DD3VXRZ?tag=select-meta-\nbluetooth-speaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Ultimate Ears Boom 3\")\n\n$87.99\n\n[Check on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DD3VXRZ?tag=select-meta-\nbluetooth-speaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Check on Amazon\")\n\nIn addition to the Amazon box at right, you can check **[Best\nBuy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ultimate-ears-boom-3-portable-bluetooth-\nspeaker-sunset-red/6288529.p?skuId=6288529) **and\n**[Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=ue+boom+3&_sacat=0&LH_TitleDesc=0&_osacat=0&_odkw=ue+boom+2)**\n, although we haven\u2019t thus far seen better prices there. Some retailers\n(especially Amazon) do sometimes have different prices depending on the color\nyou buy, so you may want to click around to different colors if you\u2019re\nflexible and see what each costs.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t recommend buying a used Boom 3 \u2014or any other battery-containing\nelectronic device \u2014 as there is no telling how many cycles the battery has\nalready been through at the time of purchase. You may end up having to replace\nthe battery too soon (though our experience with Ultimate Ears batteries has\ngenerally been quite good).\n\n## An (Unnecessary?) Accessory for the UE Boom 3: Carrying Cases\n\nThe Boom 3 is an incredibly rugged speaker and we don\u2019t think it really needs\na case (we do travel with our cables neatly stored and protected in a\n[**Skooba Cable Stable**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003D0ID8U?tag=select-\nmeta-bluetooth-speaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Skooba Cable Stable\")\nhowever).\n\nBut we hear that lots of our readers do buy cases anyway.

The cases do also provide a nice way to organize and protect the\ncharging cable and keep it alongside the speaker.\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H958DPY?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Khanka Hard Travel Case for Ultimate Ears\nUE Boom 3 Portable Bluetooth Wireless Speaker \\(Blue\\)\") [Khanka Hard Travel\nCase for Ultimate Ears UE\nBoom...](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H958DPY?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Khanka Hard Travel Case for Ultimate Ears\nUE Boom 3 Portable Bluetooth Wireless Speaker \\(Blue\\)\")\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HD1Q4ZP?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Aenllosi Hard Storge Case for Ultimate\nEars UE Boom 3 Portable Bluetooth Wireless Speaker \\(Boom 3, Black\\)\")\n[Aenllosi Hard Storge Case for Ultimate Ears\nUE...](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HD1Q4ZP?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Aenllosi Hard Storge Case for Ultimate\nEars UE Boom 3 Portable Bluetooth Wireless Speaker \\(Boom 3, Black\\)\")\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H7DL4FG?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"co2crea Hard Travel Case for Ultimate Ears\nUE Boom 3 Portable Bluetooth Wireless Speaker \\(Night Black\\)\") [co2crea Hard\nTravel Case for Ultimate Ears UE\nBoom...](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H7DL4FG?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"co2crea Hard Travel Case for Ultimate Ears\nUE Boom 3 Portable Bluetooth Wireless Speaker \\(Night Black\\)\") $12.99\n\n## Other Top Travel Bluetooth Speaker Options\n\nDepending on your audio preferences and travel style, the following speakers\nmay be more suitable for your voyages.\n\n### Top-End Sound, but More for Indoor Use (Hotels Rooms\u2026): Bose Soundlink\nMini II\n\n __\n\n[ ![Bose Soundlink Mini II](https://minimalist.travel/wp-\ncontent/plugins/aawp/public/assets/img/thumb-spacer.png)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WK47VEW?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Bose Soundlink Mini II\")\n\n[ Bose Soundlink Mini II ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WK47VEW?tag=select-\nmeta-bluetooth-speaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Bose Soundlink Mini II\")\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-speaker-20\n\"Amazon Prime\")\n\n$164.77\n\n[Check on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WK47VEW?tag=select-meta-\nbluetooth-speaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Check on Amazon\")\n\nThe **[Bose Soundlink Mini II](http://amzn.to/2mwhWpf)** is a good choice for\nthe audiophile who wants a tiny Bluetooth speaker for mainly inside use on the\nroad (hotel rooms, etc.), and doesn\u2019t need the waterproofing or klutz-proofing\nof our main pick.\n\nThe Mini II sounds just as great as its beloved predecessor (the [**Soundlink\nMini**](http://amzn.to/2lTt1x8)), according to\n[a](http://www.cnet.com/products/bose-soundlink-mini-ii/)\n[number](http://www.whathifi.com/bose/soundlink-mini-ii/review)\n[of](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2486759,00.asp)\n[reviewers](http://www.soundguys.com/bose-soundlink-mini-2-review-6237/) and\n[consumer](https://www.quechoisir.org/comparatif-enceinte-bluetooth-n817/bose-\nsoundlink-mini-p172823/)\n[organizations](http://www.which.co.uk/reviews/wireless-and-bluetooth-\nspeakers/bose-soundlink-mini-bluetooth-speaker-ii/review); they call the Mini\nII the top option for \u201cbooming bass in as small a form factor as possible\u201d and\nsay instruments and vocals in the mid-range have \u201cspace to breathe\u201d and\nimpressive warmth. It can \u201ccompetently handle the full spectrum of use.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t pair two of them together for stereo, unlike our main pick. The Bose\nSoundlink Mini II measures 7.1 x 2.3 x 2 inches (18 x 5.8 x 5.1 cm). The major\ndrawback is that it\u2019s a heavy little guy (1.5 pounds/.68 kg) and not as rugged\nand suitable for rough travel as our main pick.

It has an IP67 rating\njust like our main pick and a removable jacket that suggests it\u2019s going into\nwar \u2014 It\u2019s not going to have any issues with being dropped, bumped, or kicked\naround.\n\nIt\u2019s also the speaker we\u2019d recommend with the most battery life: 40 hours.\n\nOverall it doesn\u2019t get near as many accolades for sound as our main pick, but\nit\u2019s not too bad either. [Several](http://www.soundguys.com/fugoo-style-\nreview-1526/) [reviewers](http://www.tomsguide.com/us/fugoo-style-bluetooth-\nspeaker,review-2141.html) quite like how it handles music, while\n[another](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-bluetooth-speaker/) faults it\nfor lack of bass and volume.\n\nFugoo sells basically the same speaker in **[Sport](http://amzn.to/2mMZHwl)**\n, **[Style S](https://amzn.to/2JDwqv8)** , and **[Fugoo\nStyle](http://amzn.to/2mbwmZn)** versions, but the Tough version is the only\none that might make sense for some travellers as it is the most indestructible\nof the lot, and that\u2019s what Fugoo has going for it in comparison to other\noptions.

In our [direct\ncomparison of the Boom 3 and Megaboom\n3](https://selectoguru.com/us/reviews/ultimate-ears-boom-3-vs-megaboom-3/) we\nnote that they\u2019re almost identical in terms of design but the Megaboom 3\noffers a bit more soundstage and performs better on the bass end. It goes\ndeeper, and its lows on bass-heavy tracks are more full and convincing.\n\n### The Best Smaller Bluetooth Speaker (Slip it in a Pocket, Clip it to Your\nPack): Bose Soundlink Micro\n\n __\n\n[ ![Bose Soundlink Micro](https://minimalist.travel/wp-\ncontent/plugins/aawp/public/assets/img/thumb-spacer.png)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748N1BZD?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Bose Soundlink Micro\")\n\n[ Bose Soundlink Micro ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748N1BZD?tag=select-meta-\nbluetooth-speaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Bose Soundlink Micro\")\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-speaker-20\n\"Amazon Prime\")\n\n$79.00\n\n[Check on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748N1BZD?tag=select-meta-\nbluetooth-speaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Check on Amazon\")\n\nAt about half the size and weight of our main pick, the Bose has introduced a\nclippable, pocketable marvel that still somehow manages to deliver signature\nBose evenness and clarity, and even enough loudness to fill a room or work for\noutdoor listening.\n\nThe [**Bose Soundlink\nMicro**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748N1BZD?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Bose Soundlink Micro\") measures 3.87\ninches (9.8 cm) square and is 1.37 inches (3.5 cm) thick; it weighs 0.64\npounds (.29 kg), making it one of the lightest speakers we\u2019ve ever\nrecommended. It\u2019s fully IPX7 waterproof and has a very durable rubberized\nchassis.\n\n[The](https://www.techgearlab.com/reviews/audio/bluetooth-speaker/bose-\nsoundlink-micro)\n[tech](https://www.techhive.com/article/3232633/speakers/bose-soundlink-micro-\nreview.html) [critics](https://www.pcmag.com/review/356060/bose-soundlink-\nmicro) [and](https://www.soundguys.com/bose-soundlink-micro-review-17050/)\n[audiophiles](https://www.audiophileon.com/news/bose-soundlink-micro-\nbluetooth-speaker-review) [who](http://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/bose-\nsoundlink-micro) [have](https://www.pocket-\nlint.com/speakers/reviews/bose/143604-bose-soundlink-micro-review-portable-\nbluetooth-speaker) [reviewed](https://www.cnet.com/products/bose-soundlink-\nmicro/review/) it tend to agree that its clarity is great and there is even\nsomewhat of a soundstage and a solid bass end; it\u2019s widely held to be the\nbest-sounding small speaker of its size.\n\nThe main complaint it gets is its price; this costs more than most such tiny\nspeakers. And the battery life of six hours may deter some (though if you\u2019re\ncarrying your own [spare USB\nbattery](https://minimalist.travel/en/reviews/best-usb-c-mobile-power-banks-\nreview/) in your pack you don\u2019t have to worry).\n\nOverall, if you\u2019re someone who is into extremely light packing and you need\nyour tunes on the go, this is the speaker to go for.\n\nSee also our [comparison of the Micro with the Bose Soundlink Color\nII](http://selectoguru.com/us/reviews/bose-soundlink-micro-vs-color-ii/).\n\n## Cheaper Portable Bluetooth Speakers\n\nOur top pick is louder and sounds a bit better than the options in this\nsection; we think it\u2019s worth it as we travel constantly.\n\nBut there are other, cheaper options that are similarly lovely if you don\u2019t\nneed that extra oomph, or want to spend a bit less.\n\nYou might also especially consider the first option and buying two of them for\na portable stereo pair.\n\n### A Great-Sounding, Lightweight Disk Speaker: The UE Roll 2\n\n __\n\n[ ![UE Roll 2](https://minimalist.travel/wp-\ncontent/plugins/aawp/public/assets/img/thumb-spacer.png)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FFV59PY?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"UE Roll 2\")\n\n[ UE Roll 2 ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FFV59PY?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"UE Roll 2\")\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-speaker-20\n\"Amazon Prime\")\n\n$179.69\n\n[Check on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FFV59PY?tag=select-meta-\nbluetooth-speaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Check on Amazon\")\n\nThis comes from the same designers as our top pick and shares a similar\nvision, if in a quite different form: the [**UE Roll\n2**](http://amzn.to/2lT7moY). It is a 5.3-inch disk that is designed to be\nplaced in the center of the action and also deliver 360-degree sound. It is\nIPX7 waterproof and comes with pool float, for those who like to lounge out in\nthe water with their tunes floating next to them.\n\nThe UE Roll 2 is cheaper than our main pick, and it\u2019s not as powerful, but it\nstill delivers quite impressive loudness and bass.\n[Reviewers](http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/5/24/11758604/ultimate-\nears-ue-roll-2-bluetooth-speaker-announced)\n[have](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-bluetooth-speaker/)\n[generally](http://www.whathifi.com/ultimate-ears/roll-2/review)\n[loved](https://9to5mac.com/2016/05/24/ue-roll-2-review/)\n[its](http://www.androidcentral.com/ue-roll-2-review-small-speaker-packs-big-\npunch) [sound](http://www.cnet.com/products/ue-roll-2-review/); they say that\n\u201clittle details\u2026sizzle\u201d, that it is \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d, and that the low\nend is \u201csolid\u201d.\n\nIt has an integrated bungee cable on the back that allows you to hang or\nattach the speaker anywhere (such as the back of your backpack). As with the\nother UE options, if you buy two you can set them up as completely wireless\nstereo speakers via dedicated iOS or Android apps. In various reviewers\u2019\ntests, its battery life comes to 9 to 11.5 hours.\n\nReviewers noted little difference in sound quality between this speaker and\nthe previous version, and the [UK consumer organization actually\npreferred](http://www.which.co.uk/reviews/wireless-and-bluetooth-\nspeakers/ultimate-ears-roll-2/review) the original UE Roll to its successor.\nGiven all this, you might see if you can snag [**the original UE Roll** ,\nwhich has sometimes been cheaper on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2mN6plT) (click\nthrough to check current prices). The main improvements to the new version are\na couple of hours of battery life and that it can kick out a few more\ndecibels. For most listeners, the older version is just as great.\n\n### A Cheap Speaker that Can Survive Rough Handling: The UE Wonderboom\n\n __\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XH3PWSF?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"UE Wonderboom\") [UE\nWonderboom](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XH3PWSF?tag=select-meta-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"UE Wonderboom\") $59.95\n\nThe [**UE Wonderboom**](http://amzn.to/2nM8i3p) is [similar in price and\nfeatures to the UE Roll 2](http://selectoguru.com/us/reviews/ue-wonderboom-vs-\nroll-2/), but is built to deliver 360-degree sound and go just a bit louder.\nIt\u2019s also dustproof, and according to reviewers\u2019 tests, it survives drops\nwell.

Our bigger, chunkier recommendation would be the [Bowers & Wilkens\nT7](http://amzn.to/1s6EcVP), which we think is a bit of a step up from those\ntwo\u2026\n\n  16. ![Mose](https://minimalist.travel/wp-content/uploads/mose-profile-photo-2-IMG_8261-cropped-small-70x70.jpg)\n\n[Mose](https://minimalist.travel/en/about/)\n\n2016-04-18\n\n[Reply](https://minimalist.travel/en/packing/speakers/best-portable-speaker-\ntravel/?replytocom=741#respond)\n\nOur recommendations are very much focused on portable options. It sounds like\nthe [Bowers & Wilkens T7](http://amzn.to/26aaOxq) would be the best option for\nyou, however.\n\n  17. ![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/621b9c4ceab90867c6d1972d6e888e00?s=50&r=r)\n\nDavid\n\n2016-04-14\n\n[Reply](https://minimalist.travel/en/packing/speakers/best-portable-speaker-\ntravel/?replytocom=732#respond)\n\nThis article is fantastic \u2014 thank you!\n\nI\u2019m looking for something self-powered that gets produces good sound and gets\nloud \u2014 that\u2019s my main requirement. Cost, portability etc are less important.\nDo you have any recommendations? The only really loud option I could find is\nthe Soundboks, but review sites indicate that the sound quality isn\u2019t very\ngood. What\u2019s the next loudest option out there that has good sound quality?\n\n    * ![Mose](https://minimalist.travel/wp-content/uploads/mose-profile-photo-2-IMG_8261-cropped-small-70x70.jpg)\n\n[Mose](https://minimalist.travel/en/about/)\n\n2017-04-14\n\n[Reply](https://minimalist.travel/en/packing/speakers/best-portable-speaker-\ntravel/?replytocom=1591#respond)\n\nThis site focuses on portable equipment at this time; it sounds like you want\n[battery-powered loudspeakers](http://amzn.to/2p2NqVS) like these \u2014 you might\nstart your search there.\n\n### Leave a reply [Cancel reply](/en/packing/speakers/best-portable-speaker-\ntravel/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

We'd rather carry a few things that work well, rather than a large\nsuitcase full of \"just-in-case\" accessories. We want to hit just a few\ndestinations and really enjoy them, and travel low-carbon wherever possible,\nrather than take whirlwind tours. And we want to help others who hope to do\nthe same, and really dig into the delights that minimalist travel can provide.\n\n### Who are you?\n\nWant to see our pretty faces and the other little projects we do? Go find out\n[all about us](https://minimalist.travel/en/about/).\n\n### How do you make recommendations?\n\nWe travel endlessly, experimenting, road-testing, and seeing things first\nhand. And we review every scrap of information available, in many languages,\nbefore we make a recommendation. We provide links to others' takes too,\nincluding those we disagree with, as long as they have something smart to\noffer.\n\n### Why do your social media accounts suck?\n\nWe have lives to live.\n\n### Why should I trust you?\n\nWe never accept payment from product manufacturers or tourist boards. Our\nlittle bit of revenue is from the vast world of affiliate networks. So we can\nrecommend pretty much anything that's sold online and when we link to it, if\nyou also buy it, like it, and keep it, we get a small percentage. Our\nincentive is thus to recommend the most useful possible travel tools, so that\nyou'll come back to us when you need to know more.\n\n### How can I support this research?\n\nWe love your comments and suggestions, and are constantly updating these\narticles based on what you beautiful minimalists write in.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014-2020 Minimalist.Travel\n\n__\n\n### MENU\n\n  * [Minimalist
