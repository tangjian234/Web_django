prove that there is no point in spending a ton of money to\nget a top-notch Bluetooth speaker. You can enjoy a balanced sound for less\nthan $50 and that\u2019s not a myth. All you need to know is what features to pay\nattention to when choosing the best Bluetooth speakers under $50. Here are\nsome basic tips.\n\n### Size & Weight\n\nBluetooth speakers can be of different sizes. But most of the customers expect\nthem to be portable as the main advantage of such wireless speakers is that\nyou can take them wherever you want. Obviously, they may be not as powerful as\n[PC speakers](/best-computer-speakers/) or even [bookshelf speakers](/best-\nbookshelf-speakers/) but the question of quality isn\u2019t always number one\nespecially if you are planning a trip or a beach party.\n\nStill, not all Bluetooth speakers are compact. Some of them are rather bulky\nwhile others can boast of a pocket size. The same thing is with weight.\nThough, small speakers are sometimes heavier than big models.\n\n### Battery life\n\nAlways pay attention to the battery life of a speaker. It may vary from 5\nhours to 24 hours of playtime. Note that the battery life mentioned in the\nlist of speaker\u2019s characteristics often goes together with the percentage of\nthe volume used for performance. Just compare speakers with 8-hour battery\nlife at 50% and 75% volume.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the time of charging. It\u2019s always better to have\na speaker with quick recharging.\n\n### Sound quality\n\nThe sound quality of the speaker depends on the power of drivers it is\nequipped with as well as radiators and processor. The higher quality they have\nthe better performance you will get. Remember that high-grade speakers don\u2019t\nhave distortions at any volume and their sounding is well-balanced including\ncrisp highs and deep bass.\n\nSeems impossible for Bluetooth speaker under $50? But there are models which\ncan impress you with their sounding. Sure, it may be not as good as expensive\nspeakers can offer but the quality of the audio is quite decent.\n\n### Water resistance\n\nIt\u2019s always great to have a water resistant, or preferably, waterproof\nspeaker. Still, not all models have this feature. Some of them have only\nweather sealing while others include all types of protection. So, if you want\nto throw a party by the pool, then it\u2019s better to choose a waterproof model.\n\n### Connectivity\n\nThough the name of Bluetooth speakers presupposes only wireless connectivity\nthere are a lot of models which include 3.5 mm audio cable input as well. Such\nan option is great in case you have to pair your speaker with a non-Bluetooth\ndevice.\n\n## 12 Best Bluetooth Speakers Under $50 to Buy in 2020\n\n### JBL GO 2\n\n#### The Best Mini Bluetooth Speaker Under $50\n\n![jbl go 2](/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jbl-go-2.png)  \nThis small box with a size of your palm will provide you with a high-quality\nsound with decent bass.

So, if Bluetooth isn\u2019t available it won\u2019t be a reason to\npanic.\n\nAnother feature you will appreciate is its waterproof design.

This Bluetooth speaker\nsupports Siri when connected to your iPad or iPhone as well.\n\nPros:\n\n  * clear sound\n  * 20 hours of playtime\n  * robust build\n  * up to 100ft Bluetooth range\n  * audio cable input\n\nCons:\n\n  * not waterproof\n  * a bit bulky\n\n[__Check\nPrices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073BVWRSP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=techlounge0f-20&linkId=fcb26670670a797dc3a4a6717622d55f)  \n\n### DOSS SoundBox Plus\n\n#### The Ideal Speaker for Your Party\n\n![doss soundbox plus](/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/doss-soundbox-plus.png)  \nThe SoundBox Plus delivers a fabulous audio experience to anyone, anywhere! It\nfeatures a compact design with dual full-range drivers with a passive radiator\nthat manage to create 16W stereo sound. But the sound is not just powerful;\nthe notes are rich with crisp highs, accurate mids, and low bass.\n\nThe design is also impressive! The speaker is equipped with lights that sync\nto the rhythm and keep the party going all night long. There are five lighting\npatterns that can be adjusted according to your mood.\n\nIf you want to use it for calls, there is a built-in mic that picks up your\nvoice, supporting a crystal-clear conversation. Also, you can use it to\ncommunicate with your favorite voice assistant (Siri, Google Now, or Cortana).\nFurthermore, the capacitive touch controls are easy to use as they only\nrequire a simple touch.\n\nDue to the built-in 3200mAh rechargeable battery, the party can truly last all\nnight, as you get up to 20 hours playtime at 50% volume.\n\nNot to mention that you can get stereo sound by pairing two SoundBox devices\ntogether!\n\nPros:\n\n  * Compact and lightweight\n  * Supports Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity\n  * IPX4 rating for water resistance\n  * Good battery life\n  * Pulsating light show\n  * Powerful and impressive sound\n  * One 3.5mm AUX port\n\nCons:\n\n  * Volume controls can be a bit slow\n  * Sound quality is proportional to the price\n  * LED functionality feels like overcompensating\n\n[__Check\nPrices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TSBX3KF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=techlounge0f-20&linkId=c0f1e7df63ef87e8d7ebefe77d7c545a)  \n\n### VicTsing Shower Speaker\n\n#### Good Choice for a Shower\n\n![victsing shower speaker](/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/victsing-shower-\nspeaker.png)  \nOne of the cheapest Bluetooth speakers which can offer a top-notch performance\nand solid build quality is VicTsing Shower Speaker. Though it has only IPX5\nprotection level and isn\u2019t waterproof, its silicon case makes it dustproof,\nshockproof and water-resistant. As well as JBL Clip 2 this Bluetooth speaker\nhas an aluminum hook for convenient carrying and attaching.\n\nOf course, its audio quality isn\u2019t impressive, so don\u2019t expect to hear\nimmersive audio with crisp highs. Still, you can enjoy balanced stereo sound\nwith full range output. Besides, it includes a hands-free function for calls.\nHowever, its battery life has only 6 hours of playtime.\n\nPros:\n\n  * portable design\n  * balanced sounding\n  * hands-free calling\n  * low price\n\nCons:\n\n  * not waterproof\n  * poor battery life\n  * Bluetooth connectivity isn\u2019t the best\n\n[__Check\nPrices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NHDPLM4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=techlounge0f-20&linkId=360dc1c0e7277544ec8d5b170d5caecb)  \n\n### Tribit XSound Go Bluetooth Speaker\n\n#### Decent Speaker With Long Battery Life\n\n![tribit xsound go bluetooth speakers](/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tribit-\nxsound-go-bluetooth-speakers.png)  \nThe last but not least on our list is Tribit XSound Go Bluetooth Speaker. It\nis designed with enhanced bass radiators and dual 6W power drivers for clear\nlifelike sound. Its Bluetooth connectivity covers the 66ft range and is quite\nstable. But you can always use 3.5mm cable if you need to pair it with non-\nBluetooth devices such as a PC or TV.\n\nNote that Tribit XSound Go isn\u2019t just water resistant. It\u2019s completely\nwaterproof, so you can take it for any water adventures. Add to this a compact\nportable design and it becomes your loyal companion in any life trips from\nsandy beaches of Thailand to craggy summits of the Scandes.\n\nAnother great thing about this speaker is its long-lasting battery life.\nTribit XSound comes with 24 hours of continuous use.\n\nPros:\n\n  * waterproof\n  * audio cable input\n  * portable design\n  * 24-hour playtime\n\nCons:\n\n  * not very loud\n  * weak bass\n  * long charge\n\n[__Check\nPrices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07594HZ6Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=techlounge0f-20&linkId=6fe5e81d5dac7e18d533a1143bc306f6)  \n\n### Summary\n\nNowadays there is no need to spend hundreds of dollars to get a high-grade\nBluetooth speaker. There are plenty of options for more than just affordable\nprice. Sure, you can\u2019t expect a 50-dollar speaker to show the best music\nperformance ever. But you can always get a great sound for some outdoor fun.\n\n#### Related Posts\n\n[ ![best headphone amps]() ](https://www.thetechlounge.com/best-headphone-amp/\n\"8 Best Headphone AMPs: Enjoy Hi-Res Audio Wherever You Go\") [8 Best Headphone\nAMPs: Enjoy Hi-Res Audio Wherever You Go](https://www.thetechlounge.com/best-\nheadphone-amp/ \"8 Best Headphone AMPs: Enjoy Hi-Res Audio Wherever You Go\") [\n![best 75-80 inch tvs]() ](https://www.thetechlounge.com/best-75-80-inch-tvs/\n\"7 Best 75-80 Inch TVs To Buy in 2020\") [7 Best 75-80 Inch TVs To Buy in\n2020](https://www.thetechlounge.com/best-75-80-inch-tvs/ \"7 Best 75-80 Inch\nTVs To Buy in 2020\") [ ![the best audio interfaces]()\n](https://www.thetechlounge.com/best-audio-interface/ \"7 Best Audio Interfaces\nin 2020\") [7 Best Audio Interfaces in\n2020](https://www.thetechlounge.com/best-audio-interface/ \"7 Best Audio\nInterfaces in 2020\")\n\n#### About The Author\n\n![Mirela Nikulae](https://www.thetechlounge.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/MyPicture-Mira-150x150.jpg)\n\n##### [Mirela Niculae](https://www.thetechlounge.com/author/mirelanikulae/)\n\nIn her work, Mirela studies, tests and reviews the latest releases in audio,\nvideo, gaming, gadgets, and more.
