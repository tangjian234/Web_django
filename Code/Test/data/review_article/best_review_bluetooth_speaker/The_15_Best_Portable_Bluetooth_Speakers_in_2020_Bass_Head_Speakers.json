output\n\n\u2714\ufe0f18 hours battery life\n\n\u2714\ufe0fCarry handle on the top\n\n| \ud83d\udeabTakes some time to reach full charge\n\n\ud83d\udeabWeighs around 8 lbs  \n  \nThere\u2019s nothing quite like the [Soundcore Trance\nspeaker](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YDF1WQ7/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=basheaspe02-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07YDF1WQ7&linkId=aaee5ebda0f14ed9cdb89050e33162d2).\nIt\u2019s one of the best portable Bluetooth speakers we have tested, delivering up\nto 101 dB of sound with deep bass and rousing melodies. The entire speaker is\npowered by a front facing 5.25 inch woofer and 2 inch tweeter with passive\nradiators for huge sound performance. They are the ideal speakers for outdoor\nparties and barbecues where you just want to blast a huge amount of music with\nbass to get the party started.\n\nWhat we liked most about this speaker is that it supports BassUp technology\nwhich uses a custom algorithm to analyse the sound signature and provide\ninstant bass amplification. We tried out the BassUp feature that it does work\n\u2013 it adds a good amount of bass punch to this speaker, making it great for EDM\nand rock music genres.\n\nThe sound quality on this speaker is nice and the volume does not distort at\nmaximum levels, which is really good for parties or just casual listening.\nThis speaker has a tonne of output power and can easily drive a party from\n30-50 people without any difficulty.\n\nThe speaker is fully waterproof and you can even throw it into the pool \u2013\nwhile it floats on water. The entire speaker is IPX7 waterproof with tough\ncasing that keeps the internal components dry at all times.\n\nThere\u2019s also a beat-driven light show which the speaker can produce. It\ndelivers 5 light modes that can really add to the party atmosphere and the\nlight modes are controllable on the Soundcore app. You can watch the LED\nlights pulsate to the beat of the music, which is really fun to have.\n\nThe Soundcore Trance speaker uses the Soundcore app to control the EQ\nsettings. You can choose from 3 party modes, or swipe the screen to get extra\nLED lightshow performances. The speaker also supports outdoor modes which\namplifiers the bass for much harder hitting music sound.\n\nApart from the loud sound performance, the Soundcore Trance has a built-in\nbattery life that delivers up to 18 hours of battery time \u2013 which is really\nimpressive for a portable speaker! It also supports the latest Bluetooth 5.0\nfor high quality music streaming.\n\nIt\u2019s not a small speaker, weighing roughly around 8 lbs. That said, the\nspeaker has a tonne of power with loud volume output, and also comes with a\nnice carry handle at the top for easy portability.\n\n **The Verdict?** If you are looking for one of the best portable Bluetooth\nspeakers, [go for the Soundcore Trance portable\nspeaker](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YDF1WQ7/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=basheaspe02-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07YDF1WQ7&linkId=aaee5ebda0f14ed9cdb89050e33162d2).\nIt\u2019s a really powerful and heavy duty speaker that delivers 101dB of sound and\nup to 80 watts of power output. While it weighs slightly heavier due to its\nlarge frame, it has a nice portable handle at the top for you to bring it\naround easily.\n\n### #2 Best Sounding Portable Speaker: [JBL Xtreme\n2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CVPZJTV/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=basheaspe02-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07CVPZJTV&linkId=54f08eb080e8fa71c152eeb6fbe70f98)\n\n![JBL Xtreme 2 Portable Speaker](https://www.bassheadspeakers.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/JBL-Xtreme-2-Portable-Speaker.jpg)\n\n **JBL Xtreme 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker Specs:**\n\n  *  **Wattage** : 40 watts\n  *  **Battery Life** : 15 hours\n  *  **Waterproof Rating** : IPX7 (fully submersible)\n  *  **Bluetooth** : 5.0\n  *  **Weight** : 5.3 lbs\n  *  **Wireless Range** : 66 feet\n  *  **Bass Radiators** : 2\n  *  **Additional Features** : Supports JBL Connect+ app\n\n  \n---  \n **Pros**|  **Cons**  \n---|---  \n\u2714\ufe0fPowerful deep bass performance\n\n\u2714\ufe0fIPX7 waterproof and portable\n\n\u2714\ufe0fCarry-on strap included\n\n| \ud83d\udeabSlightly pricey speaker\n\n\ud83d\udeabDoes not support true wireless stereo  \n  \nThe [JBL Xtreme\n2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CVPZJTV/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=basheaspe02-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07CVPZJTV&linkId=54f08eb080e8fa71c152eeb6fbe70f98),\nan upgraded version of the JBL Xtreme speaker, is definitely one of the best\nportable Bluetooth speakers you can find. This speaker has one of the best\nsound signatures that we have tested so far, deliver everything from crystal\nclear highs to detailed midranges and stunning bass. This speaker has a built-\nin battery that delivers up to 15 hours of playtime on a single charge, and is\nIPX7 waterproof for outdoor activities by the pool or beach.\n\nWe were very impressed with the sound quality, versatility, design and\nportability of the Xtreme 2. It is a relatively large speaker but with a\nportable design, and we found it easy to carry around with the included carry\non strap.\n\nThe sound quality on the Xtreme 2 is superb \u2013 one of the best we have heard.\nIt has pretty impressive range and especially nice clear bass response that\nreally feels tight and punchy. The bass is impactful and does not muddy into\nany of the midrange frequencies. They are great for EDM and pop music genres\nwhere the vocals, bass and beats can really shine through. This is a speaker\nthat is definitely worth listening to.\n\nThe only downside that we found from this upgrade was that the Xtreme 2 lacks\nthe ability to daisy chain \u2013 as with all JBL Connect+ speakers. While this\nspeaker will pair wirelessly to your smartphone device without any\ndifficulties, we found that the Connect+ app not really user-friendly and\nsometimes unclear to use. You can also adjust the EQ settings on the app,\nalthough it doesn\u2019t come with a volume or EQ indicator within the app.\n\nSurprisingly, the Xtreme 2 is highly portable despite weighing a huge 2.4 kg.\nIt comes with a portable strap that you can use to carry the speaker on your\nshoulder. The built-in battery also works like a charm, delivering a grand\ntotal of 15 hours of playtime on a single charge. That\u2019s a lot of power built\ninto a portable speaker with such loud volume output.\n\nWhile JBL doesn\u2019t publish how many watts the Xtreme 2 has, we know that the\nXtreme 2 is powered by an internal amp that delivers 10 watts to each speaker\ndriver \u2013 meaning that it has 40 watts RMS total power. This is roughly as loud\nas the JBL Boombox on battery mode (the Boombox has 60 watts RMS when\nconnected to AC power).\n\nWhat we particularly loved about the Xtreme 2 is the dual side firing woofers\nthat come with the speakers. These passive-subs vibrate and move to the beat\nof the music, and you can literally feel the bass coming from these side\nradiators. This portable speaker has some of the best bass you\u2019ll ever hear in\na portable speaker, and works great for barbecues, parties and outdoor\ncamping.\n\n **The Verdict?** The [JBL Xtreme 2 is hands down one of the best portable\nBluetooth\nspeakers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CVPZJTV/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=basheaspe02-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07CVPZJTV&linkId=54f08eb080e8fa71c152eeb6fbe70f98)\nwith 40 watts RMS power and 15 hours of battery life. This thing gets\nincredibly loud with deep bass tones and details, and has some of the best\nsound quality we have heard from a portable speaker. Furthermore, this speaker\nis IPX7 waterproof and can be control via the JBL Connect+ app which you can\ndownload from the app store. While this portable speaker doesn\u2019t come cheap,\nit has really versatile features and we highly recommend them for music\nlovers.\n\n### #3 Best Budget Portable Speaker: [VTIN\nR4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QYXK9S4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=basheaspe02-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07QYXK9S4&linkId=ff2a8f4d012c5d6b619ff15fe9b9788f)\n\n![VTIN R4 Portable Speaker](https://www.bassheadspeakers.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/VTIN-R4-Portable-Speaker.jpg)\n\n **VTIN R4 Portable Bluetooth Speaker Specs:**\n\n  *  **Wattage** : 20 watts\n  *  **Battery Life** : 24 hours\n  *  **Waterproof Rating** : IPX5\n  *  **Bluetooth** : 5.0\n  *  **Weight** : 0.57 lbs\n  *  **Wireless Range** : 33 feet\n  *  **Bass Radiators** : 1\n  *  **Additional Features** : Supports TF card inputs\n\n  \n---  \n **Pros**|  **Cons**  \n---|---  \n\u2714\ufe0fPortable and powerful speaker\n\n\u2714\ufe0f24 hours battery life\n\n\u2714\ufe0fBluetooth 5.0 technology\n\n| \ud83d\udeabMay distort at max volume levels\n\n\ud83d\udeabSomewhat lacking in bass  \n  \nIf you are looking for a purely budget portable speaker, [go for the VTIN R4\nBluetooth\nspeaker](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QYXK9S4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=basheaspe02-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07QYXK9S4&linkId=ff2a8f4d012c5d6b619ff15fe9b9788f).\nThis small, compact and portable speaker is built to deliver quality music\noutput, and has actually more volume and bass than we thought it would have.\nFurthermore, the R4 speaker is equipped with the latest Bluetooth 5.0 for high\nquality wireless Bluetooth streaming with a more stable connection. If you are\non a tight budget and want to get a portable speaker that won\u2019t disappoint,\nthe VTIN R4 is probably your answer.\n\nOne thing that stands out with the VTIN R4 speaker is that, despite is small\nand compact design, it comes with a built-in battery that delivers a whopping\n24 hours of music playtime. It\u2019s great for outdoor activities and can also be\nused to charge your mobile device on the go. The speaker is designed to be\nlightweight and durable, and can be easily hand carried or attached to your\nbackpack on the go.\n\nThe speaker itself comes with 10W drivers and a HD stereo radiator. This\nallows the speaker to deliver crisp sound with a measure of stereo separation\nwhich we liked. Music performances especially vocals were presented accurately\nwith little distortion at maximum volume levels.\n\nFurthermore, the VTIN R4 speaker is designed to be IPX5 waterproof which\nresists water sprays, dust and sand.

From what we have heard, the XB12 is\ndefinitely a small and compact speaker that packs a huge punch.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the sound performance from the XB12 portable speaker. It\nsounds tight, punchy and crisp with nice volume levels. It\u2019s especially good\nfor EDM, rock and hip-hop music with the extra bass feature that ramps up the\nlower frequencies a few notches higher. We also played a couple of songs via\nYouTube streaming and found that the speaker did not have any lag or dips in\nsound quality. Everything sounded sublime and crystal clear.\n\nAnd the SRS-XB12 also supports true wireless stereo modes. This allows you to\nwirelessly connect 2 speakers and achieve active stereo sound with the built-\nin speaker add function.\n\nThe main thing to note about the XB12 is that is designed primarily for\nportability.
