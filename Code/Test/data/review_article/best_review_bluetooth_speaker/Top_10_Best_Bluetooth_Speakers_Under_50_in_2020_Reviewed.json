The product had to\n**fall below the $50 price point** to make my list.\n\nWhile the **price was a primary factor** in the ranking, I also give you some\nessential details about each based on eight categories.\n\nThese key factors represent a wide range of options that readers look for in\nan inexpensive Bluetooth speaker.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for something easy to use on the go, then portability and\nbattery life might be most important to you.\n\nSeveral options are available that work well for home entertainment decor,\ntoo.\n\nSo, what are the most relevant points of each key factor?\n\n### Portability (Size and Weight)\n\nSound quality isn\u2019t sacrificed for weight or dimension. My top choices can be\n**easily transported** by hand, in a backpack, or in a suitcase.\n\n### Battery Life\n\nYou want something that has a battery life that outlasts your best camping\ntrip. And, rechargeable batteries help stretch the dollar even further.\n\n**Rechargeable batteries are a must for this type of speaker in my book.**\n\n### Sound Quality\n\nThe best performing speakers on my list had **incredible bass** , more\n**distortion-free sound** with an **efficient output** , and **excellent\namplification** power.\n\n### Ruggedness and waterproof design \u2013 Water Resistance\n\nSuperior consideration went to speakers that had an [IPX (Ingress\nProtection)](https://maxyourhometime.com/ip-ratings-guide/) rating of IPX5 and\nabove.\n\nThat means your speaker can survive powerful jets of water (IPX6) or immersion\nfor 30 minutes (IPX7).\n\nIt also helped if the speaker had a **durability factor** that could hold up\nto your clumsiest life moments.\n\n### Connectivity\n\nThe convenience of pairing makes connecting your Bluetooth compatible devices\na breeze.\n\nBut the **range is an essential factor** , so my speaker choices needed the\noptimal range of at least 66 feet and ample device compatibility.\n\n### Design & Style Options\n\nSpecial consideration went to speakers that had a **unique design** , with\nsleek angles, and multiple color choices.\n\n### Ease of Use\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t take an aerospace engineer to figure out how to work a Bluetooth\nspeaker.\n\nMy top picks have **user-friendly functions** that make integrating your\nfavorite audio devices a snap.\n\n### Special Features\n\nEveryone likes a few **bells and whistles** now and then. You\u2019ll find\neverything from voice control, smart home-friendly features to BassUp\nTechnology on my list.\n\nAnd extra options such as a carrying case.\n\nMy top ten list has some new options for the smartest shopper. Yes, that\u2019s\nyou!\n\nBefore we dive into my top ten list, check out my detailed post **How Do\nBluetooth Speakers Work** if you\u2019re still unsure that Bluetooth speakers are\nright for you. Knowing how they work can significantly influence your buying\ndecision.\n\nNow that you know my rating criteria, here are my top 10 picks for best\nBluetooth speakers under $50 in 2020.\n\n## [#1 Anker Soundcore 2 Best overall!](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-\nSoundcore-Bluetooth-Exclusive-Water-\nResistant/dp/B01MTB55WH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-\nankersc2-list-20&linkId=919765058e8ce6a2650f4ba489e9c9de)\n\n[![](//ws-na.amazon-\nadsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01MTB55WH&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=max-\nankersc2-list-20)](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Soundcore-Bluetooth-Exclusive-\nWater-Resistant/dp/B01MTB55WH/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li3&tag=max-\nankersc2-list-20&linkId=d89292b06189603ded9f722d7b8139b7)\n\n![](https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=max-\nankersc2-list-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B01MTB55WH)\n\n### Simply The Best\n\nThis Bluetooth speaker is genuinely the **best Bluetooth speaker under 50**\nI\u2019ve found.\n\n### Battery Life Outlasts Your All-Nighter!\n\nYour all-nighter can become a 2-night party extravaganza, and you\u2019ll still\nhave time for one last dance before this speaker loses its juice.\n\nThis baby offers the **most extended playtime with 24 hours of beautiful\nbass** and **distortion-free sound**.\n\n### All About That Bass\n\nWith Anker\u2019s signature BassUp Technology, smooth, thundering vibrations\ntantalize your ears for a splendid listening experience. Soundcore 2 **can\u2019t\nbe matched** by other Bluetooth speakers \u2013 even in higher price ranges.\n\n### No Worry Water Fun\n\nAnker Soundcore 2 has an **IPX7 rating for superior water resistance**.\n\nPool, beach, rain, mud bowl, you name it, Anker Soundcore 2\u2019s rugged, water-\nresistant construction outperforms them all.\n\n### Splurge on the Extras\n\nIf you can splurge a little, there is an optional travel case for ultimate\nportability.\n\nIt would be nice if I didn\u2019t have to purchase the auxiliary cable separately,\nlike other models on my list.\n\nHowever, Anker offers a 4ft Cable for a reasonable price. And the cable is\nbacked by an 18-month warranty, just like the speaker.\n\n### Protection At Its Best\n\nAll these incredible features plus an 18-month, hassle-free warranty, make the\nSoundcore 2 my favorite choice.\n\nExcellent service can be hard to find. Anker is responsive, courteous, and\nstands behind their name.\n\n### Anker Soundcore 2 \u2013 What I Like\n\n  * Best speaker for the price point.\n  * 24-hour battery life \n  * Amazing bass even at the highest volume settings.\n  * Excellent customer service \n\n### Anker Soundcore 2 \u2013 What I Don\u2019t Like\n\n  * It doesn\u2019t come with an auxiliary cable. \n  * Not enough color options. Anker offers black, blue, and red. \n\n### Anker Soundcore 2 \u2013 Who It\u2019s Best For?\n\nYou have the perfect sound system, and you need a Bluetooth speaker that can\nmove with you.\n\nYou love your music and want to take it with you wherever you go.\n\n  * Spend time in the kitchen-not a problem.\n  * Outside gardening-nothing to it.\n  * Your favorite vacation spot-you\u2019re covered there too.\n\nAnd the best part is if you love to entertain for hours, Soundcore 2 will even\noutlast the guest that won\u2019t leave. We\u2019ve all been there, right?\n\nIf this describes you, Anker Soundcore 2 is the perfect match.\n\n[Click here for a detailed review of the Anker Soundcore\n2.](https://maxyourhometime.com/anker-soundcore-2-review/)\n\n[**Or click here to check out the Anker Soundcore 2 on\nAmazon**](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Soundcore-Bluetooth-Exclusive-Water-\nResistant/dp/B01MTB55WH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-\nankersc2-list-20&linkId=919765058e8ce6a2650f4ba489e9c9de)\n\nReturn to Table\n\n## [#2 Aomais Sport II Best rugged and\nwaterproof!](https://www.amazon.com/AOMAIS-Portable-Wireless-Bluetooth-\nWaterproof/dp/B01K9NLCV8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-\naomaissptii-list-20&linkId=57873cda1dd70b278f3ff5bdba38e033&language=en_US)\n\n[![](//ws-na.amazon-\nadsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01K9NLCV8&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=max-\naomaissptii-list-20&language=en_US)](https://www.amazon.com/AOMAIS-Portable-\nWireless-Bluetooth-\nWaterproof/dp/B01K9NLCV8/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li3&tag=max-\naomaissptii-\nlist-20&linkId=e768e90c486049748137b162b99a7089&language=en_US)![](https://ir-\nna.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=max-aomaissptii-\nlist-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B01K9NLCV8)\n\n### Rugged and Waterproof\n\nIt wasn\u2019t hard to rank this speaker #2 for the best rugged. And it\u2019s also the\n**best waterproof Bluetooth speaker under $50** in my top ten.\n\n### Ultimate Durability\n\nAomais Sport II is **built for ultimate durability**. A full rubber exterior\nprotects the well-built guts of this lustrous-looking little machine.\n\nIt has an **IPX7 rating.** If you drop it in a bathtub or pool, it can handle\n3.3 ft of immersion for up to 30 minutes.\n\nI\u2019m not the most graceful person, so the Aomais Sport II can hold up to my\nworst blunders.\n\n### Outstanding Range But Make Sure You Can Recharge\n\nThe rechargeable Lithium-battery is a win here with **up to 20 hours of\nplaytime** and a **99-foot range**.\n\nThe downside is if you like max volume, your battery life is cut almost in\nhalf.\n\nBut at mid-range volume, you can go the farthest distance and still enjoy your\nfavorite audio.\n\n### Money-Saving Options\n\nThis little powerhouse has all the best options:\n\n  * Hands-free functionality to connect with your cell phone, tablet, PC, and everything in between.\n  * Save money because this great little speaker comes with a USB cable and AUX cable.\n\n### Aomais Sport II \u2013 What I Like\n\n  * Best waterproof and rugged speaker for the price point.\n  * Rubber exterior for an extra layer of protection.\n  * AUX and USB cords at no extra cost.\n\n### Aomais Sport II \u2013 What I Don\u2019t Like\n\n  * Some distortion at max volume.\n  * You only get 20 hours of battery life at mid-range volume.\n  * Designed more for the rugged outdoors look, not home decor. \n\n### Aomais Sport II \u2013 Who It\u2019s Best For?\n\nYou\u2019re active. You love being outdoors. Your speaker can travel with you to\nthe beach, camping, and anywhere you like to experience adventure.\n\nYou can be a little clumsy, especially when you\u2019re playing hard.\n\nIf this is you, this fantastic Bluetooth speaker under 50 bucks is a goldmine!\n\n[Click here for a detailed review of the Aomais Sport\nII.](https://maxyourhometime.com/aomais-sport-ii-review/)\n\n[**Or click here to check out the Aomais Sport II on\nAmazon**](https://www.amazon.com/AOMAIS-Portable-Wireless-Bluetooth-\nWaterproof/dp/B01K9NLCV8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-\naomaissptii-list-20&linkId=f0e0aea6b168cf357d9c572fb72570f6&language=en_US)\n\nReturn to Table\n\n## [#3 JBL Clip 3 Portable Best portable!

And it can clip\nonto your clothes.\n\nIt\u2019s perfect for the runner who loves listening to their motivating playlist\nwhile beating their last run time.\n\n### Great for Active People but Not for The Partier\n\nJBL Clip 3 Portable isn\u2019t intended to produce a loud, booming volume.\n\nYou won\u2019t be hosting a pool party with this one, but the rainy-day run is not\na problem with the carabiner clip and IPX7 waterproof rating.\n\nFor the size and price of this type of speaker, it **delivers exceptional\nsound quality**.\n\n### Convenient Rechargeable Battery\n\nIt\u2019s rechargeable! As you know, this is one of my favorite features of\nBluetooth speakers.\n\nThis is especially important for a clip-and-go speaker. You use it daily, so\nthe convenience of quick charging is terrific.\n\n### JBL Clip 3 Portable \u2013 What I Like\n\n  * Nice large carabiner for flexible clip-and-go use.\n  * 13 different color choices. \n  * It\u2019s waterproof, and it floats.\n  * Affordable and performs like the higher-priced UE Wonderboom 2. \n\n### JBL Clip 3 Portable \u2013 What I Don\u2019t Like\n\n  * If you want to connect this JBL Clip 3 Portable to an older version for dual speaker sound, you can\u2019t. \n  * Issues with holding a charge. Less than 1% of more than 4,000 reviews had this problem. I can live with those odds. \n  * The front cover comes off. These issues are isolated to less than 1% of reviewers.\n\n### JBL Clip 3 \u2013 Who It\u2019s Best For?\n\nYou need something small that you don\u2019t have to carry. You love to play hard\nand workout hard.\n\nYou want something small, portable, and easy to tow while you do your thing.\n\nYou enjoy water sports, and you don\u2019t want to worry about losing or ruining\nyour new portable Bluetooth speaker.\n\nYou love cool gadgets, and you want lots of color options. You might even\nconsider buying one to match all your favorite workout clothes.\n\n[Click here for a detailed review of the JBL Clip\n3.](https://maxyourhometime.com/jbl-clip-3-review/)\n\n[**Or click here to check out the JBL Clip 3 on\nAmazon**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GDV2B7P/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-\njblclip3-list-20&linkId=04ca1e3d678bdf0c108c0ab3498eb690)\n\nReturn to Table\n\n## [#4 Tribit Xsound Go Best Sound Quality!](https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-\nXSound-Bluetooth-Speakers-\nBuilt/dp/B07594HZ6Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Tribit+XSound+Go+Bluetooth+Speakers&qid=1579936276&smid=AR8DNXAAHYMGW&sr=8-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-\ntribitxsgo-list-20&linkId=68db6837a2eb8c47d789a85020e9e1d5)\n\n[![](//ws-na.amazon-\nadsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B07594HZ6Y&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=max-\ntribitxsgo-list-20)](https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-XSound-Bluetooth-Speakers-\nBuilt/dp/B07594HZ6Y/ref=as_li_ss_il?keywords=Tribit+XSound+Go+Bluetooth+Speakers&qid=1579936276&smid=AR8DNXAAHYMGW&sr=8-4&linkCode=li3&tag=max-\ntribitxsgo-list-20&linkId=44c8aec7eddbe091e6e296d1a5e67aeb)\n\n### Fantastic Sound Quality\n\nTribit Xsound Go has a fantastic sound quality for the price that\u2019s just over\n$30.\n\nSome buyers compared this little speaker to the Anker Soundcore 2 for its\nsound performance.\n\nI agree. The bass and clarity for a smaller speaker are as close to the\nperformance of Soundcore 2 as you can get.\n\n### Fabulous Addition for Your Home Sound System\n\nTribit is an excellent addition to your home sound system.\n\nThe rich, full sound and ability to play it on max volume without distortion\nmake this portable Bluetooth speaker a great buy.\n\nYou can feel the beautiful, smooth bass when you hold the speaker.\n\nTribit\u2019s fine-tuning of the volume leveling is noticeable with minimal\nvibration transference in your hand.\n\n### See for Yourself the Sound Difference\n\nFor a live demonstration to see how Tribit stacks up against another one of my\ntop picks, Doss Soundbox, check out this [YouTube video\nclip](https://youtu.be/1X1dMO9PH98).\n\n### Conserve Battery Life with Moderate Volume but Beware the Charge\n\nTribit has a rechargeable battery. You get up to 24 hours of use if you are\nconservative with the volume.\n\nThat makes this speaker great for travel and use when no outlet is available.\nHowever, some units have failed to hold a charge.\n\nSo, make sure you test this while you are still in the warranty coverage\nperiod.\n\n### Lightweight Design for Ultimate Transportability\n\nIts lightweight design at only 13 oz makes Tribit perfect for travel.\n\nThat trip through the airport carrying your speaker in your backpack or purse\nis no problem at all.\n\n### Waterproof, Easy Connect and Range: Well-Rounded for the Price\n\nIt has an IPX7 rating, so it\u2019s perfect for your easy listening, bubble bath.\n\nAside from the great reviews on sound quality, this speaker also hit high\nmarks on connectivity.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to connect Tribit to Bluetooth compatible devices. And the 66ft\nrange means you can wander a little and still hear the music.\n\n### Tribit Xsound Go \u2013 What I Like\n\n  * Incredible sound purity and clarity for a small speaker. \n  * Lightweight design is fantastic for traveling. \n  * Better than JBL Clip 3 for portability for sound quality. \n  * Its ease of connecting to Bluetooth compatible devices is fantastic. \n\n### Tribit Xsound Go \u2013 What I Don\u2019t Like\n\n  * It can have issues holding a charge. But if you contact Tribit within the 18-month replacement warranty period, they will replace the defective unit.\n  * It doesn\u2019t come with an Aux cable.\n  * Giant logo Tribit plasters across the front cover. \n\n### Tribit Xsound \u2013 Go Who It\u2019s Best For?\n\nYou love chilling to your favorite easy-listening songs while taking a bath.\nOr relax in your comfy chair with a nice glass of wine.\n\nYou travel a lot, and you want something that is lightweight but makes you\nfeel like you\u2019re at home when you listen to your music.\n\nYou\u2019re on a tight budget, but you don\u2019t want your Bluetooth speaker to sound\nlike you didn\u2019t spend a lot of money on it.\n\nFor the price, this little speaker has a fantastic output.\n\n[Click here for a detailed review of the Tribit XSound\nGo.](https://maxyourhometime.com/tribit-xsound-go-review/)\n\n[**Or click here to check out the Tribit Xsound on\nAmazon**](https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-XSound-Bluetooth-Speakers-\nBuilt/dp/B07594HZ6Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Tribit+XSound+Go+Bluetooth+Speakers&qid=1579936276&smid=AR8DNXAAHYMGW&sr=8-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-\ntribitxsgo-list-20&linkId=68db6837a2eb8c47d789a85020e9e1d5)\n\nReturn to Table\n\n## [#5 Oontz Angle 3 Best range!](https://www.amazon.com/OontZ-Angle-3rd-Gen-\nMicrophone/dp/B010OYASRG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-\noontza3-list-20&linkId=b93e75401ce1d780a8061ca411991148)\n\n[![](//ws-na.amazon-\nadsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B010OYASRG&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=max-\noontza3-list-20)](https://www.amazon.com/OontZ-Angle-3rd-Gen-\nMicrophone/dp/B010OYASRG/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li3&tag=max-\noontza3-list-20&linkId=851051a9db54c1d43c4977d699100979)\n\n### Amazing Range Capabilities\n\nI was amazed at the range of this tiny little speaker. Up to 100 unobstructed\nfeet and this baby performs like a champ.\n\nYou can move anywhere in your home, or outside, and the Oontz Angle 3 stays\nconnected.\n\n### Don\u2019t Take It for A Swim\n\nIt only has an IPX5 rating but still can hold up to the occasional splash of\nwater \u2013 poolside or in the shower. Remember, don\u2019t submerge it, or you\u2019ll be\ndisappointed.\n\n### Little Speaker with A Lot of Pizzazz\n\nOontz Angle 3 is a small unit and weighs just over a \u00bd lb.\n\nIt\u2019s highly portable!

But, cool enough to be a conversation piece for those\ninvited party guests.\n\n### The Ultimate Home Network Experience\n\nIt\u2019s easy to connect multiple Echo Dot\u2019s throughout your home for the ultimate\nhome network experience.\n\n### Smart Speaker But Doesn\u2019t Deliver High-Quality Sound\n\nAmazon Echo Dot isn\u2019t intended to produce high-quality stereo sound.\n\nIt works best as a smart device to connect your existing audio platforms and\nintelligent home technology. But it sounds great for its intended use.\n\nAs far as Bluetooth speakers go, it wouldn\u2019t have made my list except for the\nfact that Smart technology is the latest rage.\n\nAnd I wanted to offer my followers a variety of portable Bluetooth speaker\noptions under 50 dollars.\n\nThe Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) is the best smart speaker in this price range.\n\n### Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) \u2013 What I Like\n\n  * Limitless smart technology platforms to connect with this device.\n  * Superb voice recognition technology.\n  * Sleek and rounded design for a beautiful focal piece.\n  * It\u2019s a ton of fun to interact with your guests. \n  * A user-friendly smart speaker for the newbie.\n\n### Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) \u2013 What I Don\u2019t Like\n\n  * It\u2019s not battery operated. You have to buy a separate battery base.\n  * The sound quality isn\u2019t what I would expect for the price.\n\n### Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) \u2013 Who It\u2019s Best For?\n\nIf voice controlling your music and other audio is your thing, this Amazon\nEcho Dot (3rd Gen) is perfect for you.\n\nYou love the latest gadgets, and entertaining your guests with your cool toys\nis a fun pass time for you.\n\nYou have smart home technology and want everything automated so you can focus\non other important life tasks.\n\n[**Click here to check out the Amazon Echo Dot on\nAmazon**](https://www.amazon.com/Echo-\nDot/dp/B07FZ8S74R/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-amaechodot-\nlist-20&linkId=aee056a8d12efd5b1ca8ce679fdbd1c4)\n\nReturn to Table\n\n## [#7 Doss Soundbox Best design! ](https://www.amazon.com/DOSS-SoundBox-\nBluetooth-Portable-\nHandsfree/dp/B01CRPV4UK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-dosssbox-\nlist-20&linkId=d421510029576ac931e426bfb8f90d97)\n\n[![](//ws-na.amazon-\nadsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01CRPV4UK&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=max-\ndosssbox-list-20)](https://www.amazon.com/DOSS-SoundBox-Bluetooth-Portable-\nHandsfree/dp/B01CRPV4UK/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li3&tag=max-dosssbox-\nlist-20&linkId=527b2099ee4174ac442f8a45eb70cf31)\n\n### Best Design with Cool Features, but Can Grandma Use It?\n\nNot as good as the Tribit in sound quality but still an excellent speaker for\nthe price. The best part of Doss Soundbox is the easy-to-use touch controls.\n\nAlthough the touch controls are a favorite feature for me, the volume control\nis quite sensitive.\n\nIt can be challenging to set it the way you want.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about getting one for the elder member of your family, you\nmay want to reconsider. It takes a very steady hand to use the volume control\nfeature, and that\u2019s pretty important.\n\n### DJ in a Box\n\nDoss Soundbox is sleek and stylish. And comes in five metallic color options.\n\nIt\u2019s a great little party machine. And looks the part with its modern, sassy\nstyle.\n\nAnd if you like a great light show, you\u2019ll love the sound synchronized lights.\nYes, you can turn off the lights if that\u2019s not a hot button for you.\n\n### Decent Battery Life but Won\u2019t Outlast You\n\nDoss Soundbox has a rechargeable battery with about 12 hours of playtime if\nyou set your volume at around 75%.\n\nYou won\u2019t get the volume you want for the playtime as other options on the\nlist. But still good for a few hours of party fun.\n\n### Ports for Your Aux Connection and SD Card\n\nSave money on the Aux cable because this speaker comes with one.\n\nIf you have your favorite tunes stored on an SD card, you\u2019re all set with the\nSoundbox. But an SD card doesn\u2019t come with the speaker.\n\n### Incredible Sound For The Size and Price\n\nDoss Soundbox plays nice and loud for its size, and the sound quality is\nalmost as good as some of my top picks.\n\n### Doss Soundbox \u2013 What I Like\n\n  * Modern, stylish design with multiple color options.\n  * Easy to use touch controls for the steady hand.\n  * Loud for its size. Incredible sound quality at peak volume.\n\n### Doss Soundbox \u2013 What I Don\u2019t Like\n\n  * Annoying low battery alert tone.\n  * It only has an IPX4 waterproof rating. But it does come with a waterproof bag.\n\n### Doss Soundbox \u2013 Who It\u2019s Best For?\n\nYou are into great design and style. You want a Bluetooth speaker that looks\ngreat and is easy to control with a light touch.\n\nYou love a great party, and cool lights are a hot button for you. You love\ndancing, and you want your music to dance with you.\n\nYou like extras, and Doss Soundbox includes a waterproof, drawstring pouch,\nAux and USB cable.\n\n[Click here for a detailed review of the Doss\nSoundbox.](https://maxyourhometime.com/doss-soundbox-review/)\n\n[**Or click here to check out the Doss Soundbox on\nAmazon**](https://www.amazon.com/DOSS-SoundBox-Bluetooth-Portable-\nHandsfree/dp/B01CRPV4UK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-dosssbox-\nlist-20&linkId=d421510029576ac931e426bfb8f90d97)\n\nReturn to Table\n\n## [#8 TBI Pro Bang X7 2020 Best ease of\nuse!](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Speakers-Portable-BANG-\nBuilt/dp/B07Y2B4NTS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-\ntbiprobangx72020-list-20&linkId=10236b2b34000f43442a3d264ace5737)\n\n[![](//ws-na.amazon-\nadsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B07Y2B4NTS&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=max-\ntbiprobangx72020-list-20)](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Speakers-Portable-\nBANG-Built/dp/B07Y2B4NTS/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li3&tag=max-\ntbiprobangx72020-list-20&linkId=3b7e095f225f1c920352de9ff2310230)\n\n### User-Friendly Operation\n\nTBI Pro corners the market on a user-friendly operation. This Bluetooth\nspeaker is easy to pair, has user-friendly controls, and is easy to transport.\n\n### Fast Charge, Long Play\n\nThe price is outstanding for how this incredible speaker performs. You get up\nto 24 hours of play, with just 3 hours of charging.\n\n### Distortion-Free Loud Sound\n\nThe two 10-watt speakers produce a smooth, distortion-free sound. It plays\nsurprisingly loud for its size.\n\n### Compact and Transportable\n\nIts small size also makes it great for the gym, a bike ride, or just going for\na nice walk. The carry strap is comfortable to wear around the wrist.\n\nYou can hang it from the handlebars for a nice bike ride, too.\n\n### Easily Connect Multiple Speakers and Devices\n\nIt connects easily with multiple speakers.\n\nThis little Bluetooth speaker is an excellent option for connecting to a\ntablet or device for watching videos or movies.\n\n### Water Resistant but Don\u2019t Drop It In The Pool\n\nIPX7 rating makes it great for a shower, some poolside activities, or the\noccasional rain shower. But you don\u2019t want to submerge the unit.\n\nThis is an overall great buy in the 50 and under portable Bluetooth speaker\ncategory.\n\n### TBI Pro Bang X7 2020 \u2013 What I Like\n\n  * User-friendly and straightforward to pair with other devices.\n  * It\u2019s a sturdy, durable speaker.\n  * The subwoofer in the back gives it a beautiful full bass sound. \n  * 64GB memory card to save your great playlist.\n\n### TBI Pro Bang X7 2020 \u2013 What I Don\u2019t Like\n\n  * Not as lightweight as other portable speakers. \n  * Touts and IPX7 rating but has issues working if submerged or splashed.\n\n### TBI Pro Bang X7 2020 \u2013 Who It\u2019s Best For?\n\nYou want something simple to operate. You just want to pack, play, and go.\n\nYou want all the sound you can get for your limited budget. And rich bass is a\nhot button.\n\nYou know you won\u2019t have stereo quality, but you won\u2019t settle for too much\ntreble.\n\nYou have your favorite music, and you want to be able to play it anytime you\nwant, so you want something compatible with your memory card.\n\n[Click here for a detailed review of the TBI Pro Bang\nX7.](https://maxyourhometime.com/tbi-pro-bang-x7-review/)\n\n[**Or click here to check out the TBI Pro Bang X7 2020 on\nAmazon**](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Speakers-Portable-BANG-\nBuilt/dp/B07Y2B4NTS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-\ntbiprobangx72020-list-20&linkId=10236b2b34000f43442a3d264ace5737)\n\nReturn to Table\n\n## [#9 JBL Go 2 Best mini!](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Waterproof-Portable-\nBluetooth-\nSpeaker/dp/B07QDPRYYD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=jbl+go2&qid=1584152177&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-\njblgo2-list-20&linkId=d73da8ddf9b8e5475463ed5a44cbb713)\n\n[![](//ws-na.amazon-\nadsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B07QDPRYYD&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=max-\njblgo2-list-20)](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Waterproof-Portable-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker/dp/B07QDPRYYD/ref=as_li_ss_il?keywords=jbl+go2&qid=1584152177&sr=8-3&linkCode=li3&tag=max-\njblgo2-list-20&linkId=6469178338d5a212b1714f19e5b3544a)\n\n### Tiny but Delivers On Sound\n\nThis is the ultimate portable mini Bluetooth speaker.\n\nFor its tiny size, it has a great sound. Be careful though, it\u2019s easy to lose\nonly weighing 6 ounces and just over 1.5\u201d wide.\n\n### Pricy for a Mini but Fantastic Little Speaker\n\nIt\u2019s higher priced than I would expect for its features, but JBL made a mini\ndynamo for a Bluetooth speaker.\n\n### Tiny Treasure Needs A Case\n\nYou\u2019ll want to purchase the optional carrying case so you can protect your\nlittle treasure. Its small size makes it susceptible to drops, bangs, and\ncrushes. One reviewer even ran over it with a car. Still worked though.\n\n### So Many Colors, How Do You Choose?\n\nJBL Go 2 comes in a dozen different color options. This is truly a fun little\ngadget and is perfect for all your favorite exercise activities.\n\n### Ultimate Sidekick for Those Extracurricular Activities\n\nIt pumps out just enough sound to give you pleasurable listening experiences.\nI love gardening, and this speaker fits perfectly in my utility bag.\n\nThe size makes it great for travel and works wonderfully as an added speaker\nfor your phone.\n\n### JBL Go 2 \u2013 What I Like\n\n  * Mini size doesn\u2019t compromise the listening experience.\n  * 12 color options, even Champagne.\n  * Optional waterproof carrying case for ultimate portability.\n  * Speaker has an IPX7 rating.\n\n### JBL Go 2 \u2013 What I Don\u2019t Like\n\n  * The battery life only gives you 5 hours of playtime with \u00bd volume.\n  * The small size makes it difficult to hear with background noise. \n\n### JBL Go 2 \u2013 Who It\u2019s Best For?\n\nYou want a mini speaker that is easy to use and ultra-portable.\n\nYou want something you can pack for a hike, sunning at the beach or that\nintimate picnic with your loved one.\n\nYour home workout needs some inspiration, and your best Rock tunes are the\nanswer.

For just over $20, you can have a\ntremendous sounding speaker on a super tight budget.\n\n### Big Sound, Crazy Deep Base\n\nIt\u2019s not quite as good as the Oontz Angle 3.\n\nBut in my humble opinion, it outperforms the Anker Soundcore Mini, which is\nwhy the Soundcore Mini didn\u2019t make my top 10 list.\n\nZosam packs a big sound with crazy deep bass for the low price. And it\u2019s loud\nfor its size and price.\n\n### Not A Smart Speaker But It\u2019s Smart\n\nIt remembers your last device connection and has an SD card insert option as\nwell as an Aux port.\n\n### Excellent Durability For Big Blunders\n\nZosam is super durable and can endure a lot of bumps and bangs. It\u2019s extremely\nsolid with an iron and rubber shell.\n\n### Not The Best Design for Water\n\nThis speaker has an IPX6 waterproof rating. It\u2019s not the highest rating but\nstill great for a cheaper priced speaker.\n\nIt can withstand a splash or two, so go ahead and use it in the shower if\nyou\u2019re careful.\n\nYou can even enjoy it on the beach. Just don\u2019t expose it to large amounts of\nwater splashing.\n\nIt\u2019s great for home, office, and travel.\n\n### Zosam Portable \u2013 What I Like\n\n  * Reasonable price for the tight budget.\n  * Very durable construction and design.\n  * 10 hours of playtime, which is terrific for the price.\n\n### Zosam Portable \u2013 What I Don\u2019t Like\n\n  * The cheaply made clip doesn\u2019t match the durable design of the speaker.\n\n### Zosam Portable \u2013 Who It\u2019s Best For?\n\nYou want a decent speaker that isn\u2019t a waste of your hard-earned dollars.\n\nYou want something to hear your favorite audio in multiple places.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to spend a lot since you need a few speakers for places you\nspend the most time, such as work, home, and travel.\n\n[Click here for a detailed review of the\nZosam.](https://maxyourhometime.com/zosam-speaker-review/)\n\n[**Or click here to check out the Zosam Portable on\nAmazon**](https://www.amazon.com/Zosam-Portable-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Anti-\ndrop/dp/B079HS71TJ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Zosam&qid=1584152264&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-\nzosamport-list-20&linkId=1d4989ada6d432383797c054707e8953)\n\nReturn to Table\n\n## You\u2019re Ready to Rock Now!\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the best Bluetooth speaker under 50 dollars, the [Anker\nSoundcore 2 tops them all](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Soundcore-Bluetooth-\nExclusive-Water-\nResistant/dp/B01MTB55WH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=max-\nankersc2-list-20&linkId=919765058e8ce6a2650f4ba489e9c9de).\n\nYou\u2019re budget-conscious, and you want a great Bluetooth speaker that won\u2019t\nbreak the bank.\n\nYou can play your favorite music until the wee hours of the morning with 24\nhour/500-song running capability.
