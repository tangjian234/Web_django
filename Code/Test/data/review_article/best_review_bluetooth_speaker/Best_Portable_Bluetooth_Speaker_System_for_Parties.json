It could be in their backyard, at the beach, or their\nfavorite out-of-the-way camping site.\n\nBut if you expect to throw the odd party on the go, you will need a portable\nbluetooth speaker. And that speaker better have a satisfyingly full and loud\nsound. Otherwise you will quickly bore your eager party guests to sleep.\n\n![](https://www.voicesinc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ECOXGEAR-\nEcoboulder.jpg)\n\n### Our Pick:\n\n[ECOXGEAR GDI-EXBLD810 Speaker](https://amzn.to/2q6Is8K)\n\nAfter examining all the factors, this speaker offers the clearest sound and\nthe best overall volume level. It's our top recommendation this year.\n\n[**Find a sales price here**](https://amzn.to/2q6Is8K)\n\nThe immediate debate after that realisation, however, is what the best\nportable bluetooth speaker for parties is. That is what I went to find out.\n\nIn this article I will discuss the qualities, and review the top options, of\nthe best portable bluetooth party speakers available today.\n\n  \n  \n\n### Who Needs a Portable Bluetooth Speaker?\n\nIf you are an audiophile and you own a smartphone, tablet, or even a laptop,\nyou could probably use a good bluetooth speaker.\n\nThe great benefit of bluetooth speakers is their wireless connection\ncapability. There is virtually no need for cables to connect the speaker to\nthe music player. Adding a rechargeable battery also removes the necessity of\na power cable.\n\nBecause bluetooth speakers don\u2019t require cables, you can use them indoors,\noutdoors, and in remote locations where you have no access to any a/c power.\n\nAll you need is your bluetooth enabled smartphone, tablet, or laptop and you\ncan get a party started, regardless of where you may be at.\n\nSo, anyone who can\u2019t live without their music and don\u2019t need an excuse to get\na party going would also consider buying portable bluetooth speakers. The\nbeauty is there are bluetooth speakers for virtually every need, including;\n\n  * Rugged, compact brutes that can stand up to any environment,\n  * Waterproof beauties that will take the occasional dip in their stride,\n  * High sounding wannabe PA monsters you can dance to from a mile away, and\n  * Elegantly shaped, colorful sound boxes that will make regular hotel rooms feel more like home.\n\n#### How Portable Should a Bluetooth Speaker Be?\n\nFor the top party bluetooth speakers, portability usually means a compact\nspeaker that\u2019s not too heavy to carry. The bigger ones are even fitted with\nsmall wheels, which makes it easy to cart them around.\n\nSo portability in the end also depends on where you intend to use your\nbluetooth speaker. If you will mostly be using the speaker in your backyard\nthen you can probably get away with choosing a slightly less portable speaker.\n\nIf you are going to be travelling a lot, a smaller bluetooth speaker may be a\nbetter option. But you will usually have to sacrifice some power and bass\nresponse to get that extra portability.\n\n### What Makes a Good Quality Portable Bluetooth Speaker?\n\nThis question is not as easy to answer as would be assumed.\n\nAs you will see, to get some attributes people look for in the best portable\nbluetooth speaker, you may have to sacrifice some power, which is an important\nparty speaker quality.\n\nYou are, thus, unlikely to find a bluetooth speaker with the fullest and\nloudest sound that is also marked by its excellent portability. It seems there\nare always trade-offs.\n\nBut it is fair to say the features most important to you, with the power,\nsound quality, and battery life considered, depend largely on your particular\nuse scenario.\n\nWith that said:\n\n> _**Any speaker will always be judged on the quality of its sound.**_\n\nIf you have a trained ear, one of the first things you notice with bluetooth\nspeakers is the sound will come out as slightly degraded.\n\nThe reason for the less clearer sound is bluetooth speakers rely on the less\nreliable sound waves to transmit audio files from the source.\n\nIt also isn\u2019t uncommon to notice slight variations of pitch in the middle of a\nsong.\n\nThis is largely because bluetooth compresses audio files in the process of\nstreaming them between devices. It could also be that bluetooth does not\ndecode audio files at a consistent speed.\n\nWhat should be remembered, however, is that all bluetooth speakers use short-\nwavelength radio waves to receive sound from the transmitting device. Sound\nwaves simply take the place of cables on wired speakers.\n\nThe differences in quality of the sound between bluetooth speakers is thus\nmore a factor of the quality of the speaker\u2019s audio drivers than the bluetooth\ntechnology itself.\n\n#### Long Playback Time is a Must for a Battery Powered Bluetooth Speaker\n\nEven with bluetooth connectivity, a speaker would still not be portable if you\nhave to connect it to a power source using an electric cable.\n\nTo be truly portable, the speaker will need portable power that can only be\nsufficiently supplied by an inbuilt, rechargeable battery. But it still\nwouldn\u2019t be much of a party if the battery only lasts a few hours.\n\nThe top portable bluetooth speakers will give you up to 10 hours of\ncontinuous, full-volume playing.\n\nYour party speaker may not give you that much playback time, but it should\ngive you at least more than half of that.\n\nThe sound itself should be able to fill an average sized room without sounding\nmangled. It is important to emphasize the fullness of the sound and not fixate\non how loud your bluetooth speaker should be.\n\nNo matter how long the speaker plays, you will quickly fall out of love with\nit if the sound is clipped and distorted.\n\n### Other Factors to Consider When Buying a Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\nParty and tailgate bluetooth speakers are now such a mature product category\nthat manufacturers often have to include other features to differentiate and\nupsell their speakers.\n\nThis can only be good news for the consumer. But beware, you may end up paying\nfor features with a fleeting usefulness and which don\u2019t add much in terms of\nthe speaker\u2019s primary function.\n\nThere are a few features, however, that aren\u2019t bad to have in your party\nBluetooth speaker;\n\n  * **Waterproofness** \\- A speaker that is waterproof can be taken out to the pool, beach, and into the woods without worrying about the risk of water damage. If not fully waterproof, the speaker should at least take the occasional splash without sending you into a panic.\n  * **Rugged build quality** \\- Knocking the speaker off a picnic table shouldn\u2019t induce a panic attack either. If you are going to be using it in tough environments, your Bluetooth speaker will need to be built tough, otherwise it will just not last you that long.\n  * **USB power bank** \\- Some Bluetooth speakers come with a power bank with USB charging ports that can prove to be a massive party saver, especially if you are playing your music from a smartphone, tablet, or other portable music player. A power bank will also provide a convenient power source for your phones when partying in remote locations where having a reliable communication device is important.\n  * **Protective casing** \\- Some Bluetooth speaker models have protective soft or hard covers to protect them from scratches and weather damage, seeing you may need to use them on camping sites with rough terrain.\n\nNow back to the question, what is the best portable Bluetooth speaker for\nparties?\n\nMost of the options available have at least one attribute at which they excel.\nBut for purposes of this guide we analyzed our five portable Bluetooth speaker\npicks primarily on;\n\n  * How well they sound\n  * How long they can hold a charge\n  * How portable they are\n  * How much they cost\n\nEven though we wanted our Bluetooth speakers to be as portable as possible,\nyou will find we leaned towards speakers that appear to be larger. It also\nseems counter-intuitive. But there is a reason we did this.\n\nWhile portability was an important factor, we did not forget that the speakers\nalso had to be loud, with a big sound. Otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be party\nspeakers now, would they?\n\nSo, even though a speaker may have a high wattage rating, it\u2019s sound may not\nnecessarily be that big. For that a speaker will also need to have larger\ndimensions. That bigger size has a direct bearing on the speaker\u2019s bass\nresponse, something party goers will want in a sound.\n\nFor this reason, I ended up excluding speakers, like the [Ultimate Ears\nMegaboom,](https://amzn.to/2IBcOqT) a very good, durable speaker, and the [JBL\nBoombox,](https://amzn.to/2KvkM6N) a waterproof, highly portable bluetooth\nspeaker that scored highly on most of the features we were after.\n\n### Best Portable Bluetooth Party Speaker Reviews\n\nThere are wildly varying performance levels for the many portable bluetooth\nspeaker options on the market.\n\nAnd there are too many of them, including models from traditional heavyweights\nlike Bose and Yamaha, and other emerging brands, that we can\u2019t possibly review\nthem all here.\n\n**Here are our top 5 picks:**\n\n#### AOMAIS GO Bluetooth Speakers\n\n[![](//ws-na.amazon-\nadsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B071H8MJ99&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=music0be5b-20&language=en_US)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071H8MJ99/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li3&tag=music0be5b-20&linkId=7eec05af56d17bd6df150fa56010269d&language=en_US)![](https://ir-\nna.amazon-\nadsystem.com/e/ir?t=music0be5b-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B071H8MJ99)\n\n* * *\n\nThis speaker\u2019s tough build quality and beastly appearance perfectly adapts it\nto outdoor use.\n\nThe AOMAIS GO is easily the toughest portable bluetooth speaker under $100.\nWhether it is EDM, hard rock, or any mellower sound you feel like partying to,\nthis speaker\u2019s 2X15W full range audio drivers have the power to fill up any\nroom or outdoor space.\n\nA dual subwoofer improves the speaker\u2019s tonal quality to give it a clear party\nsound that has a perfect bass and power balance.\n\nIf you are in an outdoor venue and like your music to be especially loud,\npairing two of these speakers will jack up the power to an ear-busting 60\nwatts. That will also give you a nice surround sound.\n\nThe speaker also has a fun karaoke mode that can really spice up your parties.\nAfter all, we all fancy ourselves as good singers after we have downed one or\ntwo cocktails.\n\n**Other Features and Benefits**\n\n  * Battery gives you 8 hours of playback time, which goes up to 10 hours if you are listening at around 50 % of full volume,\n  * Rugged build makes it perfectly suitable for both indoor and outdoor use,\n  * It is very lightweight, making it supremely portable,\n  * An ergonomically positioned handle makes the speaker remarkably easy to handle,\n  * Waterproofed, so you can keep the party going even when it rains,\n  * Easy to pair when used with another.\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * The speaker will start to distort when played at full volume,\n  * The Amazon 30 hours of playback time description is misleading, as you get 12 hours at most, which, by the way, is still very good.\n\n#### [See the Product Listing on Amazon >> Click\nHere](https://amzn.to/2O1Cb83)\n\n* * *\n\n#### Big Blue Party Indoor-Outdoor Bluetooth Speaker\n\n[![](//ws-na.amazon-\nadsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B0065CXXEM&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=music0be5b-20&language=en_US)](https://www.amazon.com/Big-\nBlue-Speaker-\nBlack-733673p/dp/B0065CXXEM/ref=as_li_ss_il?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1540386051&sr=1-13&keywords=brookstone&linkCode=li3&tag=music0be5b-20&linkId=7d541a45c6d1943186ac2fbd9e6d9a2f&language=en_US)![](https://ir-\nna.amazon-\nadsystem.com/e/ir?t=music0be5b-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B0065CXXEM)\n\n* * *\n\nThis is a beautiful looking bluetooth speaker with great portability.\n\nHonestly, look at it.
