It is a speaker that is packed with many different functions, has a\nlong battery life and also has a really good sound. We also recommend the\npowerful JBL Charge 3 as another all-round good speaker.\n\n![](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/896x504/i/bit-boards/Bluetooth-speaker-\nbest-in-test.jpg)\n\n## How we did the test\n\nWe tested all of the speakers in two different indoor environments: in a\nsmaller room with muted acoustics and in a space with an open layout. The\nspeakers were tested at three different volume levels (maximum, average and\nlow) with the same selection of modern pop/RnB, rock and classical music\nstyles. We tested their sound quality when using them in hands-free mode with\na mobile phone and also tested their sound quality outdoors in a light wind.\nSince we had no rain during the test period, we tested the waterproof\nqualities of speakers by simulating artificial rain in the shower. The\nspeakers with relevant IPX classifications also got to take a bath in order to\ntest how waterproof they were. We carried out the decibel measurement using\nthe Decibel 10 and SoundMeter apps on an iPad. The measurements were carried\nout at ear height, two metres from the speakers. The values quoted in these\nreviews are an average based upon the readings from both apps. In addition to\nsound quality, operating time, output power, functions and whether the speaker\nwas waterproof, we also factored the speaker\u2019s design and product price into\ntheir score.\n\nWe tested the speakers using the following pieces of music:\n\n  * New York Dolls \u2013 Personality crisis\n\n  * Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra \u2013 Mahler, Symphony no. 5\n\n  * NEIKED feat Dyo \u2013 Sexual (Oliver Nelson remix)\n\n  * M83 \u2013 Lower your eyelids to die with the sun\n\n **Sound source:** We connected a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and an Apple iPad to\nthe speakers via Bluetooth and streamed the music through Tidal.\n\n## 1\\. Sony SRS XB30 - BEST BLUETOOTH SPEAKER 2020\n\nA great Bluetooth speaker with lots of functions, a long battery life and\nreally good sound quality\n\n **Dimensions:** 228x82x86 mm **Weight:** 980 grams **Connection:** Bluetooth,\nNFC, line in (3.5 mm), USB **Battery capacity:** 6 Ah **Measured battery\nlife:** 24h+ (without \u201cExtra Bass\u201d) **Measured maximum sound level:** 91.8 dB\n**Water resistant:** Yes (average, IPX5 class) **Miscellaneous:** Disco\nlights.\n\n![Sony SRS-XB30](https://www.pricerunner.com/product/400x400/3000455427/Sony-\nSRS-XB30.jpg?overlay=PR_Best-i-test_UK.png)\n\nWith a great sound quality, many different functions and an extremely long\nbattery life, we believe that the **Sony SRS XB30** is the best speaker in our\ntest. Looking at the speaker\u2019s appearance, you would be forgiven for thinking\nthis is a \"party speaker\". The speaker grille has blinking LED disco lights\nand the words \"Extra Bass\" splashed across its box would normally indicate\nthat the speaker has more volume than finesse. But in the case of this\nspeaker, appearances are deceptive. This speaker sounds great, with a bass,\nmid-range and treble that are all extremely well balanced. It can cope\nvaliantly with everything from modern RnB to classical music, regardless of\nthe volume you want to play it at. The sound is characterised by impressive\nairiness and noise separation. If you do want to add a little more oomph there\nis the aforementioned \"Extra Bass\" button, which gives a surprisingly\nsophisticated boost to the lower ranges. Surprisingly, it does this without\naffecting the mid-range too much. The extra bass does swallow a little of the\nlower mid-range and the energy of the sound does diminish a bit, but this is\nnothing as bad as similar functions on other speakers. It almost sounds as\nthough two new speakers have popped out of the side of the unit to make the\nbass a little broader, while the rest of the sound remains largely unchanged.\nWe also felt that the speaker was also less direction sensitive than many\nother products in the test.\n\nThe operating time of the speaker is stated as being around 24 hours. With the\ndisco lights and the extra bass activated this is more likely to be around six\nhours, but without these functions the XB30 does in fact deliver on this\npromised amount. You can also control the disco lights via an app if you\nprefer.\n\nA slightly odd aspect of this speaker is the patent protected USB charging\ncable that it comes with. You really don't want to lose this as the speaker\ncan't be charged using a normal USB cable. This is a big minus point for the\nspeaker, and one that felt entirely unnecessary. However, one clever detail\nthat makes up for this slightly is that the speaker can also be used to charge\nother USB gadgets via an outlet on the back. The Sony SRS XB30 is also IPX5\nclassified, which means that it should tolerate splashes of water and even\nlight rain \u2013 something our testers can confirm. The XB30 can also be used as a\nhands-free unit with your mobile. When we tested these functions both the\nfunctionality and sound quality were impressive.\n\nOutstanding noise qualitylots of functionslong battery lifeuseful app\n\nExtra Bass and LED lights are heavy on the batterystrange USB contact\n\n### Price Comparison\n\n[Compare all prices](/pl/267-3951011/Speakers/Sony-SRS-XB30-Compare-Prices)\n\n[Electrical Deals\n\nSony SRS-XB30 Extra Bass Water-Resistant Bluetooth NFC Portable Speaker Red\n\n\u00a399.99](/gotostore/v1/UK/94463_SRS-XB30R?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)\n\n## 2\\. JBL Go 2\n\nA straightforward, well-balanced and good value for money Bluetooth speaker\n\n **(HxWxD):** 71.2 x 86.0 x 31.6 mm **Weight:** 184 g **Connection:**\nBluetooth, line in (3.5 mm) battery life: 5 h **Measured maximum noise\nlevel:** X dB **Water resistant:** Yes (average, IPX7 class)\n\n![JBL Go 2](https://www.pricerunner.com/product/400x400/1824057776/JBL-\nGo-2.jpg)\n\nThe **JBL Go 2** is an extremely good value for money compact Bluetooth\nspeaker that, at despite its low price, feels neither plasticky nor low\nquality. The speaker essentially has the same control function as on more\nexpensive models by the same manufacturer. You can increase/reduce the volume,\npause, Bluetooth pair and turn the unit on/off directly on the speaker. The\nsound is really good, particularly for such a compact speaker. Yes, there\ncould have been a bit more depth in the bass level, but on the other hand the\nspeaker\u2019s sound is pretty well-rounded and rich overall. The bass level also\nisn\u2019t that bad. Genres that rely on a little more bass still sound good, but\nspeaker is at its best when it comes to pop, classical music and similar\ngenres. You can turn up the volume without distorting the sound and it can\nalso receive calls via the speaker\u2019s built-in microphone. This latter feature\nworks OK, but it gives around the same sound quality as if you were using\nspeakerphone on your phone itself.\n\nThe JBL Go 2 isn't a luxury Bluetooth speaker, which becomes clear when you\nlook at its details. For example, there's no way to hang the speaker in order\nfor it to better spread its sound, nor does it have NFC support. You also\nwon\u2019t get any detailed information about the speaker\u2019s remaining battery life,\nwhich felt slightly frustrating. The battery life as a whole lasts five hours,\nwhich is just about acceptable. However, the Go 2 does have a very high IP\nclassification, meaning that you can take it swimming without any worries.\n\nIt looks like JBL had some clear priorities when designing this speaker, which\nthey succeeded pretty well in achieving. This is a super-compact Bluetooth\nspeaker with a good sound quality that would be great for a camping trip since\nit won\u2019t weigh down your rucksack unnecessarily. If you're looking for a\nreally good value for money, compact Bluetooth speaker, the JBL Go 2 would be\nan excellent choice.\n\nVery compact & lightwatertightrelatively good soundhigh build quality\n\nRelatively short battery liferather weak bass levels\n\n### Price Comparison\n\n[Compare all prices](/pl/267-4568438/Speakers/JBL-Go-2-Compare-Prices)\n\n[![Currys\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/currysnewlogo.gif)\n\nJBL GO2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Black, Black\n\n\u00a319.99](/gotostore/v1/UK/120_10182981?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Very\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/verynew.gif)\n\nJbl Jbl Go2, Compact Portable Speaker With Battery, Ipx7 Waterproof\n\n\u00a319.99](/gotostore/v1/UK/31991_22438765?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)\n\n[PSK Mega Store\n\nJBL GO 2 3 W Mono portable speaker Ciano\n\n\u00a321.46](/gotostore/v1/UK/106339_6615-jbl-go-2-bluetooth-speaker-icecube-\ncyan-6925281938542?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)\n\n## 3\\. Ultimate Ears Megaboom 3\n\nBudget, bath-friendly speaker with lots of clever functions\n\n **Width:** 87 mm **Height:** 225 mm **Depth:** 87 mm **Weight:** 925 g\n**Connection:** Bluetooth, USB **Measured battery life:** 19 hours\n**Waterproof:** Yes (high, IP67) **Miscellaneous:** Can be connected to two\nsource units simultaneously, can be connected to up to 8 other UE speakers for\nlouder sound\n\n![Ultimate Ears Megaboom\n3](https://www.pricerunner.com/product/400x400/1866897314/Ultimate-Ears-\nMegaboom-3.jpg)\n\nThe **Ultimate Ears Megaboom 3** is a speaker that can play music at very high\nvolume. It\u2019s a substantial unit that feels both stable and well built. The\nrounded shape means that it produces 360 degree sound. In other words, you\ndon't need to angle it towards the listeners, because you get just as good\nsound if you're sitting behind it.\n\nThe buttons have a rather minimal response, but otherwise we have no negative\ncomments on the design.\n\n### Control the sound via the equaliser\n\nAs the name indicates, this is a speaker that focuses on the bass. And this\nbecomes really clear when we start the music. It has good punch and real\ndepth.\n\nThe bass eats up some of the mid-range. If you're going to listen to bass-\nheavy music that nevertheless requires a certain amount of finesse in this\nregister, the results may disappoint. That said, the app that goes with the\nspeaker has a built-in equaliser so you can reduce the bass. After a little\nfiddling with the settings, you can get really good sound quality for the\nprice class. There isn\u2019t a huge difference, but enough for you to be able to\nfind a personal profile with a more well-balanced sound. Vocalists come\nthrough particularly well.\n\nAs mentioned above, you can play your music on very high volume with this\nspeaker. It's ample for a large apartment, or a single storey house. One minor\ndisadvantage is that there's a certain amount of distortion at high volume.\nBut you really have to have the volume turned up a lot for this to be a\nproblem.\n\nThe app we mentioned above also supports a mode called \u201cblock party\u201d. This\nmeans you can allow several people to connect to the speaker and contribute to\nthe playlist. You're limited to your friends\u2019 music that's stored locally on\ntheir phones, though \u2013 or Amazon's music service. But the idea's still a good\none.\n\nUnfortunately the app doesn't support Spotify. But it does allow Amazon and\nDeezer. Of course you can always run Spotify through its own app, but the\nspeaker has a button on the top allowing you to link to your favourite\nplaylist, and this doesn't work with Spotify, which is a bit of a shame.\n\nOne nice feature is that you can connect the Megaboom with other Ultimate Ears\nspeakers and get them to play music in several rooms at once.\n\nThe speaker has really good IP classification, which means you can take it in\nthe pool with you. It also floats. As long as the speaker is at least partly\nabove the surface, it continues to play music. But the part beneath the water\ndoesn't produce any sound. In other words, if you submerge it, it\u2019ll go\nsilent.\n\nThe battery life is good as long as you don't play the music too loud. We have\nit running in the daytime in working hours, and it lasts for about 2.5 days\nbefore it needs to be charged. You can either charge it using the cable that\ncomes with it, or buy a wireless charging station.\n\nIn terms of price, the Ultimate Ears Megaboom 3 is in a category with\nconsiderable competition, but it stands up well all the same. The sound isn't\nas clear and rich as it is in the slightly more expensive speakers. But it has\na lot of oomph in the bass, and you can set the sound profile with the\nincluded equaliser to get a better sound balance. Overall, you get a lot of\nsound, battery life and functions for your money.\n\nGreat battery lifelots of functionstons of volumepowerful bassreally good\nrange\n\nSome distortion at high volume\n\n### Price Comparison\n\n[Compare all prices](/pl/267-4708175/Speakers/Ultimate-Ears-\nMegaboom-3-Compare-Prices)\n\n[![Currys\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/currysnewlogo.gif)\n\nULTIMATE EARS MEGABOOM 3 Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Peach\n\n\u00a3109.00](/gotostore/v1/UK/120_10194887?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Amazon.co.uk\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/amazoncouk_w.gif)\n\nUltimate Ears MEGABOOM 3 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker (Powerful Sound +\nThundering Bass, Bluetooth, Magic Button, Waterproof, Battery 20 hours, Range\n45 m) - Seashell Peach\n\n\u00a3109.00](/gotostore/v1/UK/2137_B07G6LHJMP?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![OnBuy.com\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/150x50.png)\n\nUltimate Ears Black MEGABOOM 3 Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\n\u00a3121.50](/gotostore/v1/UK/104426_OPC-PWQ6ZH-\nNEW?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)\n\n## 4\\. JBL Flip 5\n\nA neat companion with great sound\n\n **Width:** 69 mm **Height:** 181 mm **Depth:** 74 mm **Weight:** 540 g\n**Connection:** Bluetooth, USB-C **Battery life:** 12 hours **Waterproof:**\nYes (very high tolerance, IPX7, doesn\u2019t float) **Miscellaneous:** Can be\nconnected with more speakers from the Party Boost series for louder sound or\nto create a stereo effect\n\n![JBL Flip 5](https://www.pricerunner.com/product/400x400/1893379010/JBL-\nFlip-5.jpg)\n\nThe **JBL Flip 5** is very like previous generations of the same model, with\nthe difference that it has much better sound quality. Given the size and price\nof the speaker, the sound is really good. Above all, it now has highly\nappreciated bass pressure. Its predecessor was much less convincing on this\npoint. But it isn't the kind of bass that drowns out everything else \u2013 instead\nit contributes to better balance in the sound.\n\nUnfortunately, despite the 360 degree design, the sound is highly targeted. If\nyou\u2019re standing behind the speaker, the soundstage is clearly worse.\n\nBut if you're facing the sound, the detail is high over the entire frequency\nspectrum. The Flip 5 can also cope with relatively high volumes without\ncreating distortion, although the treble can seem rather shrill.\n\nIn terms of sound, it doesn't quite achieve the same level as the same\ncompany\u2019s Boombox, but the sound quality and volume are definitely sufficient\nfor hanging out on the beach or for listening to music in the kitchen.\n\nOne aspect that\u2019s rather a shame is that you can only connect the Flip 5 to\nother speakers from JBL\u2019s PartyBoost series. For example, if you already own a\nCharge (or another model from the Connect+ series), you won't be able to pair\nthem to play music simultaneously from a single source. We would have\npreferred JBL to expand the Connect+ series so their customers only needed to\nconsider one system.\n\n### Best for the beach\n\nThe JBL Flip 5 is equipped with USB-C, which charges the battery quickly. The\nbattery also lasts for a long time between charges.\n\nThe battery life is perhaps on the short side given that many competitors are\nnow approaching the 20-hour mark. But we clock it to just over 11 hours\u2019 play\ntime at high volume, and that\u2019s far from poor given how portable it is. The\ncompetitors with longer battery lives are often a good bit larger. The big\nadvantage with the Flip 5 is how compact and neat it is, and as long as you\ncan play music for an entire day on the beach without having to worry about\nthe battery life, we think it does pretty well.\n\nAnother factor that means the Flip 5 works so well on the beach is that it has\na high IP classification. For example, you can spill juice on it and then\nrinse it off with water, or drop it into the pool \u2013 although if you do this\nyou\u2019ll have to dig out your goggles and take a deep breath, because it doesn't\nfloat.\n\nThe buttons for Bluetooth and power are a bit stiff. But the volume, play and\nconnect buttons are significantly more responsive. The materials feel well\nchosen and the build quality sturdy.\n\nUnfortunately it doesn\u2019t have NFC. Nor does the speaker have an AUX input \u2013\nbut on the other hand, this isn\u2019t really a deal breaker any more as most\npeople play music from their phones, using Bluetooth. But if you do need AUX,\nthis is worth noting.\n\nThe JBL Flip 5 delivers a relatively good sound quality given the price and\nsize. It's ideal for anyone looking for a light and compact Bluetooth speaker\nthat can cope with being splashed with juice or rinsed off with water.\n\nVery portablegood sound qualityhigh IP classificationhigh build qualitygood\nvolumefast charging\n\nCan only be connected to PartyBoost seriesrather short battery lifedoesn\u2019t\nfloat\n\n### Price Comparison\n\n[Compare all prices](/pl/267-4991806/Speakers/JBL-Flip-5-Compare-Prices)\n\n[PSK Mega Store\n\nJBL FLIP 5 20 W Altoparlante portatile stereo Blu\n\n\u00a376.44](/gotostore/v1/UK/106339_6633-jbl-flip-5-bluetooth-speaker-\nblue-6925281954573?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Currys\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/currysnewlogo.gif)\n\nFlip 5 Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Pink, Pink\n\n\u00a379.99](/gotostore/v1/UK/120_10198364?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Amazon.co.uk\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/amazoncouk_w.gif)\n\nJBL FLIP 5 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Green\n\n\u00a379.99](/gotostore/v1/UK/2137_B07QDTN5BR?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)\n\n## 5\\. JBL Charge 3\n\nHas a powerful sound and is very water resistant, but is also somewhat\ndirection sensitive\n\n **Dimensions:** 213x87x88.5 mm **Weight:** 800 grams **Connection:**\nBluetooth, USB **Battery capacity:** 6 Ah **Measured battery life:** 20h+\n**Measured maximum sound level:** 90.9 dB **Water resistant:** Yes (high,\nIPx7) **Miscellaneous:** Three units can be connected to the speaker at the\nsame time, and it can be linked to other JBL speakers for more powerful sound.\n\n![JBL Charge 3](https://www.pricerunner.com/product/400x400/1567921504/JBL-\nCharge-3.jpg)\n\nThe **JBL Charge 3** distinguishes itself from other speakers with its\ncombination of good sound quality and really good water resistance, making it\nsuitable for outdoor use and even in the pool. We were sceptical when we first\ndropped JBL's Charge 3 into the water, but we quickly saw that the speaker\nboth floats and carries on playing as if nothing had happened. When we angled\nthe speaker up to the surface of the water, we also got an entertaining\ndemonstration of its bass as the speaker bounces water droplets off itself in\ntime with the music. The IPX7 classification means that you could in theory\ntake this speaker into the bath with you. Often these kinds of claims don't\nalways stand up in the consumer electronics world, but JBL deliver what they\npromise here. In our test the speaker survived for 30 minutes at a 1m depth.\n\nIf this impressive waterproofing wasn\u2019t already enough, the Charge 3 also has\nan extremely good sound quality. It's primarily its bass level that impressed\nus, with the speaker having an energy and bite that's pretty rare in this\nprice class. We also feel that the speaker\u2019s mid-range may be the best on the\nmarket. The treble is equally good but is unfortunately extremely direction\nsensitive. Aiming the JBL logo on the front of the speaker towards you makes\nan enormous difference compared to if you aim it even only a few centimetres\nin another direction. While it doesn't sound bad, you should definitely take a\nlittle care when positioning the speaker in order to get an optimal sound. The\nspeaker elements maintain a good sound until you've got the volume turned up\nquite high, which is where we noted some distortion in the otherwise pleasant\nmid-range. At lower volumes, the frequency response is good right from bass to\ntreble. Thanks to its relatively large 6000mAh battery, the speaker also works\nas a portable power bank and can be used to charge smartphones or other units\nvia USB. Unfortunately there is no support to connect the speaker to other\nunits by NFC though.\n\nWaterproofgood bass pressurefantastic mid-rangemany connection options\n\nNo support for NFCtreble is direction sensitive\n\n### Price Comparison\n\n[Compare all prices](/pl/267-3162592/Speakers/JBL-Charge-3-Compare-Prices)\n\n[![Fairwayrock\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/fairwayrocklogouk.png)\n\nJBL Charge 3 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Blue\n\n\u00a397.99](/gotostore/v1/UK/108855_jbl-charge-3-waterproof-portable-bluetooth-\nspeaker-blue?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Fairwayrock\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/fairwayrocklogouk.png)\n\nJBL Charge 3 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Black\n\n\u00a399.99](/gotostore/v1/UK/108855_jbl-charge-3-waterproof-portable-bluetooth-\nspeaker-black?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Currys\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/currysnewlogo.gif)\n\nLG Charge 3 Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Black, Black\n\n\u00a3109.00](/gotostore/v1/UK/120_10194888?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)\n\n## 6\\.

This speaker can join you in the pool without any\nproblems, as long as you don't use it at depths of over 1m for more than 30\nminutes. However, the speaker doesn't float so you do need to be careful if\nyou\u2019re using it around deep water. We thought was a bit of a shame as other\nJBL speakers have this feature. The Flip 4 feels heavy and robust in a way\nthat's reminiscent of its big brother, the Charge 3. In many respects it can\nbe seen as a reduced version of that speaker.\n\nThis speaker offers a sharp and precise bass, an unparalleled mid-range and a\nreally good treble, while its battery also lasts for a very long time on one\ncharge. We tested the speaker on a medium to high volume and can confirm the\nbattery lasted for the promised 12 hours without a problem. The Bluetooth\nconnection is also very stable. The connection didn\u2019t drop until we were 17m\naway, which is an impressive range. On the negative side, however, the\nspeaker\u2019s sound quality isn't the best when you use it as a hands-free unit\nfor your mobile. It sounds tinny and distant, which will be a problem if you\nvalue this function. Apart from this minor shortfall, this is an excellent buy\nin terms both in terms of price and size.\n\nGood sound for the sizeIPX7 classifiedgood battery capacity\n\nPoor sound for hands-free use doesn't float\n\n### Price Comparison\n\n[Compare all prices](/pl/267-3777101/Speakers/JBL-Flip-4-Compare-Prices)\n\n[![BT Shop\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/BT_Shop.jpg)\n\nJBL Flip 4 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Black\n\n\u00a359.98](/gotostore/v1/UK/7539_21563519635?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![BT\nBusiness Direct\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/btbusinessdirect.jpg)\n\nJBL Flip 4 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Black\n\n\u00a359.98](/gotostore/v1/UK/40684_21563519793?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Fairwayrock\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/fairwayrocklogouk.png)\n\nJBL Flip 4 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Black\n\n\u00a367.99](/gotostore/v1/UK/108855_jbl-flip-4-waterproof-portable-bluetooth-\nspeaker-black?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)\n\n## 7\\.

Just like the four years older\nSoundlink Mini model, this unit quickly became a favourite of ours due to its\ncapability for an amazing amount of bass. In terms of the higher frequencies,\nthe sound is characterised by a soft and extremely detailed treble, but a\nslightly less obvious mid-range. One impressive aspect of this speaker\u2019s sound\nis that both its bass pressure and sound definition are consistent and well\ndistributed, regardless of the volume you choose. The Soundlink Mini 2 also\nworked well in our larger room test in a way that speakers of this small\nrarely do, even though its stereo width is clearly limited by its size.\n\nThe Soundlink Mini 2 is a neat looking speaker, with its aluminium outer shell\nand design that leans towards minimalist Danish interior design rather than\nhome electronics. The speaker also has a huge battery life capacity, which\ndespite the fact that we used it heavily for more than 12 hours coped without\nany problems. It also gets plus points for having a voice feature to tell you\nhow much battery life you have left.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the Soundlink Mini 2 does lack a number of useful\nfunctions and features such as NFC and water resistance, which means it will\nprimarily be of interest to those who want to use it indoors. This is a shame\ngiven its high price and long battery life capability. As a result, the\nSoundlink Mini 2 may feel a little on the expensive side for someone who wants\nthe flexibility of using it outside. However, anyone looking for a compact and\nattractive indoor solution won\u2019t find anything better on the market.\n\nExcellent sound quality with impressive treblehigh class build qualitystylish\ndesign\n\nExpensive for the size classno NFC\n\n### Price Comparison\n\n[Compare all prices](/pl/267-3079246/Speakers/Bose-SoundLink-Mini-2-Compare-\nPrices)\n\n![Illustration - No prices](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/empty-\nstate/NO_PRICES.svg)\n\n## 8\\. Bose Soundlink Micro\n\nA well designed small format speaker that has excellent sound\n\n **Weight:** 290 g **Connection:** Bluetooth, micro-USB **Battery capacity:**\n6 Ah **Battery life:** 6h **Waterproof:** Yes (high, IPx7 classified)\n**Miscellaneous:** Suspension strap\n\n![Bose SoundLink\nMicro](https://www.pricerunner.com/product/400x400/1731181698/Bose-SoundLink-\nMicro.jpg)\n\nThe **Bose Soundlink Micro** is a very compact Bluetooth speaker with a well\nthought out design. The speaker has a strap on the back that allows you to\nattach it to a belt, chair or bicycle handlebars amongst other things. This\nalso means that you can easily keep the speaker off the ground in order to\nachieve better distribution of sound. The fastener for the strap is quite\nloose but has a special kind of hook that means you tighten as you stretch it.\nThis allows you to attach the speaker to things that are quite thin \u2013 but not\ntoo thin, or else the speaker will fall off.\n\n### User-friendly design\n\nThe buttons for voice control and volume are located on top of the speaker so\nthat you can easily access them even when it's hanging up. The power and\npairing buttons are on the other side so that you won\u2019t mix them up. The four-\nstep battery indicator is also here. If you switch the speaker on and off the\nbuilt-in voice will give you the exact battery level, together with the unit\nthe speaker\u2019s connected to. The material around the speaker is a kind of\nsilicon which can be a little slippery to hold, but on the other hand doesn\u2019t\nattract dirt or dust.\n\n### Good sound quality\n\nThe Bose Soundlink Micro produces excellent sound. It\u2019s impressive that Bose\nhave managed to get such a well-balanced sound out of such a small speaker.\nThe sound is a little muffled at higher volumes but is significantly better\nthan what we expected from something this size. The speaker is easily good\nenough for you to take to a day out at the beach or to the park. It\u2019s also\nIPX7 classified, meaning you can spill a drink over it or drop it in the sea\nwithout problems. Ours also worked fine in the bath.\n\nThe Soundlink Micro is part of the Bose Connect system. This means that, via\nthe Bose app, you can link together a number of speakers and play music\nthrough all of them at the same time. This is probably not something you\u2019ll\nbenefit from enormously unless you have other products with this\nfunctionality, but it is a good feature if you do and want to have a more\nsubstantial speaker system to use outdoors. If you're looking for a very\ncompact, well-designed speaker with good sound quality, the Soundlink Micro is\ndefinitely a really good buy if you can find it for less than \u00a3100.\n\nGood sound qualityCompact formatwatertight\n\nSlightly slipperyLimited shape for suspension\n\n### Price Comparison\n\n[Compare all prices](/pl/267-4277519/Speakers/Bose-SoundLink-Micro-Compare-\nPrices)\n\n[![Fairwayrock\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/fairwayrocklogouk.png)\n\nBOSE Soundlink Micro Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Black, Black\n\n\u00a387.00](/gotostore/v1/UK/108855_bose-soundlink-micro-portable-bluetooth-\nspeaker-black-black?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Audiovisual Online\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/audio_visual_online.jpg)\n\nBose SoundLink Micro Speaker Orange\n\n\u00a389.00](/gotostore/v1/UK/47286_86336?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)\n\n[Musical-images\n\nBose SoundLink Micro Bluetooth Speaker in Black\n\n\u00a389.00](/gotostore/v1/UK/102359_bose-soundlink-micro-bluetooth-speaker-in-\nblack?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)\n\n## 9\\. Bose SoundLink Revolve\n\nPowerful 360 degree sound in a neat format\n\n **Dimensions:** 15.2 cm x 8.2 cm x 8.2 cm **Weight:** 680 g **Connection:**\nBluetooth, NFC, line in (3.5 mm), micro USB Measured battery life: 11 hours\n**Waterproof:** Yes (average, IPX4 class) **Miscellaneous:** Support for Siri\nand Google Assistant commands, built-in microphone for use as a speaker\ntelephone\n\n![Bose SoundLink\nRevolve](https://www.pricerunner.com/product/400x400/1680510621/Bose-\nSoundLink-Revolve.jpg)\n\nThe **Bose Soundlink Revolve** is a Bluetooth speaker in a neat format with a\nreally good, enfolding sound stage. The tower design means you get really good\nsound from all directions. For example, the format is suitable for the dining\ntable on a smaller patio. The fact that the design is also stylish means the\nspeaker fits in well on the table.\n\nThe battery lasts for about half a day, which is roughly two dinner parties\u2019\nworth. It\u2019s nothing to boast about, but nor is it too bad given how compact\nthe speaker is. The battery is charged easily via micro USB, but of course you\ncan also run it on a mains cable.\n\nGiven the price, we'd have preferred a slightly higher IP classification. You\ncan splash this model with water, but you can't drop it in the bath. It\u2019s also\ngot a rather poor range. We reckon you can go about 6-7 metres from the\nspeaker but then the connection quality starts to suffer. This isn't great\ngiven that it promises 9 metres.\n\nOtherwise, the speaker has similar specifications to its competitors in the\nsame price class \u2013 for example, you can answer phone calls with it and pair it\nwith units using NFC.\n\n###Great sound and a good app As we\u2019ve already mentioned, the Bose Soundlink\nRevolve offers very good sound quality, particularly given the compact format.\nYou get well-balanced sound with sufficiently powerful bass and a clear\ntreble. The mid-range emerges nicely too.\n\nThe sound spreads out well in the room, because the speaker is round.\n\n### Reliable-feeling build quality\n\nThe Soundlink Revolve exudes \u201cquality product\u201d, both in terms of material\nchoices and user experience. The associated app is also very easy to use. For\nexample, you can link together two similar speakers to cover a larger area.\nUnfortunately, however, you have to keep the speakers within a relatively\nshort distance of each other, because otherwise they lose the connection,\nwhich is pretty much the whole point of this function. If they'd worked on Wi-\nFi, it would have been better.\n\nThis speaker is great for anyone looking for a neat table unit for the patio\nthat gives equally good sound in all directions. You're paying above all for a\nneat, well-designed format, really good sound and high quality.\n\nGreat sound quality360 degree soundwell built\n\nPoor rangerather low IP class\n\n### Price Comparison\n\n[Compare all prices](/pl/267-3966481/Speakers/Bose-SoundLink-Revolve-Compare-\nPrices)\n\n[![Audiovisual Online\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/audio_visual_online.jpg)\n\nBose Revolve Bluetooth Speaker Black\n\n\u00a3159.00](/gotostore/v1/UK/47286_85864?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Hills\nRadio\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/hillsradio.gif)\n\nBose SoundLink Revolve Black\n\n\u00a3159.00](/gotostore/v1/UK/71549_bose-soundlink-revolve-\nblack?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Home AV Direct\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/home_av_direct.jpg)\n\nBose Soundlink Revolve Bluetooth Wireless Speaker\n\n\u00a3159.00](/gotostore/v1/UK/85655_bose-soundlink-revolve-bluetooth-wireless-\nspeakers?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)\n\n## 10\\. Bose Soundlink Color II\n\nExcellent sound and easy to carry with you\n\n **Dimensions:** 127x131x55.5 mm **Weight:** 540 g **Connection:** Bluetooth,\nNFC, line in (3.5 mm), micro USB **Measured battery life:** 8 h (measured)\n**Measured maximum sound level:** 86 dB (measured) **Water resistant:** Yes\n(average, IPX4 class)\n\n![Bose SoundLink Color\n2](https://www.pricerunner.com/product/400x400/1680512938/Bose-SoundLink-\nColor-2.jpg)\n\nDespite its small size, the **Bose Soundlink Color II** offers impressive\ndynamics and meticulously balanced timbre. Here you get just the right amount\nof treble, a well-defined mid-range \u2013 and a whole load of bass, at least in\nrelation to the size of the speaker. It may not move mountains, but it's still\nextremely powerful for its category. And it does it with style, too. It has\nboth tone and definition. However, other than the sound, the speaker's a bit\nnothingy. For example, eight hours' operating time is perfectly acceptable,\nbut not astonishing. And the IPX4 classification means that it's water-\nresistant rather than waterproof. So you shouldn't take the Soundlink Color II\nin the pool with you. But if it's raining a bit, it should cope without\nproblems.\n\nA plus point for the Soundlink Color II is how mobile it is. It's not exactly\nflat, but it's certainly thin enough to fit in a jacket pocket. The rubberised\nmaterial covering the speaker also gives a good grip, and keeps off dust and\ndirt very effectively. The controls are well positioned on the upper part of\nthe speaker, although they could have been a little bit clearer. But once\nyou've learned what's where, it quickly becomes easy to operate. It's easy to\npair the speaker with your phone, and the clear instructions from the built-in\nvoice makes the whole procedure very easy. So what is the target audience for\nthis Bluetooth speaker? The Soundlink Color II is a speaker for anyone\nprioritising portability and sound quality over volume and watertightness.\nAlthough to be perfectly honest, you'd better not be all that bothered about\nstylish design either.\n\nCompact format, very good sound, voice instructions for pairing\n\nNot watertight, operating time below average\n\n### Price Comparison\n\n[Compare all prices](/pl/267-3966536/Speakers/Bose-SoundLink-Color-2-Compare-\nPrices)\n\n[Musical-images\n\nBose SoundLink\u00ae Colour Bluetooth\u00ae Speaker II - Soft Black\n\n\u00a3107.00](/gotostore/v1/UK/102359_bose-soundlink-colour-bluetooth-speaker-ii-\nsoft-black?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Atlantic Electrics\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/altanticelectrics.gif)\n\nBose\u00ae SoundLink\u00ae Color II Portable Bluetooth Wireless Speaker - Red\n\n\u00a3112.00](/gotostore/v1/UK/71749_bose-sl-colour-ii-\nred?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Audiovisual Online\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/audio_visual_online.jpg)\n\nBose SoundLink Colour II White\n\n\u00a3114.00](/gotostore/v1/UK/47286_85790?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)\n\n## 11\\. Sony SRS-XB10\n\nSimple model with a cool design\n\n **Weight:** 259 g **Connection:** Bluetooth, NFC, line in (3.5 mm) **Battery\nlife:** 16 hours **Waterproof:** Yes (average, IPX5 class) **Miscellaneous:**\nSuspension ring\n\n![Sony SRS-XB10](https://www.pricerunner.com/product/400x400/1752774839/Sony-\nSRS-XB10.jpg)\n\nThe Sony SRS-XB10 is very easy to get started with. When you first start it,\nBluetooth mode starts automatically and we could immediately find the unit in\nthe phone's device list. You can easily set it up and start playing music. It\nalso supports NFC as well as Bluetooth.\n\nBut the sound quality leaves quite a lot to be desired. The speaker sounds as\nif it's underneath a rug. The bass pressure is perfectly acceptable for a\ncompact speaker, but that's at the cost of details in both the mid-range and\ntreble. There's also distortion at high volume.\n\nAs it's such a compact and cheap speaker, the sound is OK, but no more than\nthat.\n\nThe SRS-XB10 also has a microphone, which means you can take calls using the\nunit so you don't have to pick up your phone. The microphone does a good job\nof excluding environmental noise. But it's very sensitive, so you pretty much\nhave to speak directly into it from close range for the person on the other\nend of the line to understand what you're saying.\n\n### Attractive design but boring sound quality\n\nThe Sony SRS-XB10 has a rubberised surface that gives a good grip. But the\nmaterial also attracts a good deal of dust and dirt. The speaker feels well\ndesigned, however. It's a bit reminiscent of a small soft drinks can with\nbuttons on the side that give nice haptic feedback.\n\nOn the top there\u2019s a ring you can use to hang up the speaker so you get a\nbetter spread of sound. And the ring also doubles as a holder for the speaker\nif you lay it down, preventing it from rolling away. That's clever!\n\nThe SRS-XB10 is IPX5 classified, so it should be able to cope with jets of\nwater, but you can't take it swimming. The battery life of 16 hours is\nexemplary.\n\nGiven the price, this is a really portable speaker with rather poor sound\nquality but a long playback time. It's perfect if you're looking for a simple\nspeaker that you can take into the bathroom or out on a cycle trip in the\nrain.\n\nEasy to get starteduseful suspension ringattractive design\n\nUnbalanced sounddistortion at high volumesattracts dust\n\n### Price Comparison\n\n[Compare all prices](/pl/267-4417623/Speakers/Sony-SRS-XB10-Compare-Prices)\n\n[![Purewell Electrical\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/purewell.png)\n\nSony SRSXB10 Portable Wireless Speaker-Green ex Display\n\n\u00a339.87](/gotostore/v1/UK/59868_sony-srsxb10-portable-wireless-speaker-\ngreen?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Amazon.co.uk\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/amazoncouk_w.gif)\n\nSony SRS-XB10 Compact Portable Wireless Speaker with Extra Bass - Black\n\n\u00a340.00](/gotostore/v1/UK/2137_B06VWXPC19?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Amazon.co.uk\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/amazoncouk_w.gif)\n\nSony SRS-XB10 Portable Wireless Speaker NFC, Bluetooth and EXTRA BASS, Blue\n\n\u00a344.06](/gotostore/v1/UK/2137_B06XBTMMBW?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)\n\n## 12\\.

Of course you might feel that there's a\nbit more to a speaker than that, but let\u2019s start with the good things.\n\nThe speaker is really small (about the size of a 33 cl drink can) and it's\nalso very attractive with its mesh grille and matte plastic housing. It\u2019s also\nvery easy to pair with your phone, tablet or whatever the source is.\n\nBut other than volume there aren\u2019t many setting options when it comes to\nsound. There's no associated app or any controls on the actual hardware. You\nset the sound from the client you\u2019re using to play the music.\n\nHowever, there are play and pause buttons on the unit. These are responsive\nand a reasonable size, but aren't very visible, particularly in poor lighting.\n\n### Dubious 360\u00b0 sound\n\nThe unit is equipped with two speaker elements which claim to deliver 360\u00b0\nsound. This means that the sound should be sent out in all directions so that\nyou can stand where you want in relation to the speaker and still get good\nsound. In other words, it should sound about the same from all angles. But\nunfortunately it doesn\u2019t. The treble in particular changes enormously with\neven minor adjustments in the position of the speaker in relation to the\nlistener.\n\nBut the fact that the speaker only delivers 5 watts is astonishing, because it\ncan be really loud when you need it. Unfortunately, being very loud isn\u2019t the\nsame as producing a very good sound \u2013 and it definitely doesn\u2019t do this. The\nlower register rumbles quite a lot and the treble is often overdriven and\nsharp.\n\nThere\u2019s no bass pressure to speak of at all, but on the other hand that was\nonly to be expected given the size of the speaker, so it hasn't affected our\nscore much. But if you're looking for a party starter, this probably isn\u2019t the\nspeaker for you.\n\n### Perfect by the pool\n\nThe Muvo Play is watertight and you should be able to take it in the pool with\nyou. We tested it in a slightly more harmless situation \u2013 in the bath (in\nother words, where there\u2019s no chlorine). And here it definitely does live up\nto its promised watertightness. The sound isn\u2019t affected appreciably by the\nwater, even though of course the distribution effect isn\u2019t the same with part\nof the speaker under the water.\n\nIn terms of connection, the speaker offers a relatively classic Bluetooth 5\nexperience, where the signal holds up until we pass either thicker walls or\nreach about 12-15 metres from the unit.\n\nFor charging the speaker, it uses a USB-C connection.\n\nIt also works for telephone conversations and with the Siri or Google Play AI\nassistants. That\u2019s nice.\n\nOverall, our feeling is that you have to be very price conscious to consider\nthis particular portable Bluetooth speaker. It does offer a number of features\nthat you don\u2019t normally get in this price class. But it really doesn\u2019t produce\nvery good sound, and good sound is pretty much the point of a speaker.\n\nAttractivewatertightgood battery life\n\nPoor sound qualityuneven sound distribution\n\n### Price Comparison\n\n[Compare all prices](/pl/267-4995541/Speakers/Creative-Muvo-Play-Compare-\nPrices)\n\n[![Argos\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/argosnewer.gif)\n\nCreative Muvo MF8365 PC Speaker Set - Black\n\n\u00a329.99](/gotostore/v1/UK/30487_3083000?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Alzashop\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/alzashop.gif)\n\nCreative MUVO Play black\n\n\u00a338.90](/gotostore/v1/UK/64675_5652987?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)\n\n## 13\\. Dell AD211\n\nA budget model that fits in well on your desk\n\n **Width:** 213 mm **Height:** 87 mm **Depth:** 88 mm **Connection:**\nBluetooth, NFC, USB **Measured battery life:** 10h **Waterproof:** No\n\n![Dell AD211](https://www.pricerunner.com/product/400x400/1554108265/Dell-\nAD211.jpg)\n\nThe **Dell AD211** is a relatively straightforward Bluetooth speaker that\namazingly still features NFC support despite its relatively low price. This\nmakes it easy to connect to your mobile phone if it has an NFC connection. If\nyou don\u2019t have NFC, you can also still connect it via Bluetooth. The\nconnection is stable and delivers on Dell\u2019s stated ten metre range. The\nconstruction of the speaker is solid enough, but the material choice is a bit\nboring and feels slightly cheap. The buttons provide a moderate, almost weak,\nresponse which makes it rather difficult to feel whether or not you\u2019ve pushed\nthe button or not. Once you have succeeded in pressing the buttons the\nresponse is immediate and the LED icons clearly show the function of each\nbutton. The grey colour is the same as you find on many laptops, so the\nspeaker will also fit in nicely on a desk or in an office.\n\nThe Dell AD211 has an acceptable sound quality, but nothing more than that.\nUnfortunately the sound is a bit unbalanced, tending to edge towards a high\ntreble level. The bass is limited and the mid-range is a little bit mushy. At\nhigher volumes we also felt that the sound quality was a bit too sharp. We\u2019ve\ndefinitely heard speakers with worse sound quality, but this Bluetooth speaker\nsomehow manages to sound cheap \u2013 which, of course, it is. Despite this, the\nbattery life of the speaker is pretty good for its price and we got about ten\nhours out of it. It also has a low battery warning which is a rather\nirritating \u2018bloop\u2019 noise. It took us a while before we realised that this was\na battery level warning rather than problem with the music, as unfortunately\nthis sound recurs a bit too frequently.\n\nToday, the majority of speaker manufacturers build a voice feedback function\ninto their speakers and this Dell speaker would have benefited from this. The\nDell AD211 is aimed at anyone looking for a cheap Bluetooth speaker that\u2019s\neasy to carry around and while also fitting nicely on a desk.\n\nNFC supportNeat sizeGood battery life\n\nUnbalanced soundIrritating battery level warningBoring material choice\n\n### Price Comparison\n\n[Compare all prices](/pl/267-3024664/Speakers/Dell-AD211-Compare-Prices)\n\n![Illustration - No prices](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/empty-\nstate/NO_PRICES.svg)\n\n## 14\\.

This is a welcome break from the\nregular rubber or plastic button panels that most other speakers have.\n\nUnfortunately our positive first impression was somewhat marred by the\nexceptionally short USB cable that comes with the unit\u2019s mains adapter. This\nwas problematic right from the start, forcing us to stand the unit on the\nfloor while charging it, which wasn't optimal. We also had quite a lot of\nproblems with the Bluetooth pairing. Only after a couple of failed attempts at\nturning the Bluetooth on and off at both the speaker and the source did they\nfinally find each other. However, we didn't have this problem with the second\nsound source we tried, so it might have been a particular problem to that\nfirst device. In general, the Bluetooth connection of this speaker did leave a\nlot to be desired as the unit lost connection at mere 6m and 7m during our\nrepeated tests in a range of different environments.\n\nThe sound from the unit is perfectly OK, but definitely not the best amongst\nother speakers we tested in this size class. At low volumes the bass was far\ntoo weak and only started to come into its own at volumes that were so high\nthat the higher frequency ranges were distorted. This somewhat tinny sound\nalso made the upper mid-range and treble levels feel rather thin. However, the\nspeaker\u2019s sound was less direction sensitive than many of its competitors as\nthe unit has full range speakers in both its front and back. As a result of\nits low weight and compact size, the BT6000A is also very easy to take with\nyou and its IPX4 classification means it can cope with rain without problems.\n\nAttractive designmany connection options360\u00b0 sound\n\nTinny sound with thin trebleshaky Bluetooth connection\n\n### Price Comparison\n\n[Compare all prices](/pl/267-3065050/Speakers/Philips-BT6000-Compare-Prices)\n\n![Illustration - No prices](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/empty-\nstate/NO_PRICES.svg)\n\n## 15\\.

It's not just its classic design that the Marshall Stockwell shares\nwith Marshall\u2019s iconic guitar amps; perhaps not unsurprisingly, its sound also\npacks a punch. This is a speaker that provides a great deal of volume. With\nfull bass, we measured a volume of an astonishing 93.8dB. However, it doesn't\noffer particularly spectacular hi-fi quality. While its black and gold plated\nrectangular casing is no doubt attractive, it unfortunately has a relatively\ntinny and muffled sound. The bass thankfully doesn't bottom out or distort but\nis isn\u2019t particularly obvious or heavy. When you play music that has a\nslightly more airy and separated sound, it becomes painfully obvious that the\nfrequency response is rather weak in the lower mid-range and the treble lacks\nbite.\n\nIf you're looking for a speaker that's both loud and doesn't sound awful, this\none won\u2019t a bad choice. It's a very attractive and well-built speaker that\nfeels nicely heavy, stable and sophisticated and has nice metal controls. It\u2019s\na high quality design that you'd expect on a unit displaying the classic\nMarshall logo. The speaker\u2019s intelligent support also makes it easy to\nposition it in order to get best sound quality for the conditions it\u2019s\nsituated in. But if you're primarily after a speaker with really good sound\nquality, this won\u2019t be the speaker for you.\n\nBuild quality, designGood build qualityclassic and stylish design\n\nTinny mid-rangeweak bass pressure\n\n### Price Comparison\n\n[Compare all prices](/pl/267-3113464/Speakers/Marshall-Stockwell-Compare-\nPrices)\n\n[![I Want One Of Those\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/iwoot2015.jpg)\n\nMarshall Stockwell Black\n\n\u00a3109.99](/gotostore/v1/UK/10838_26411093275?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)[![Zavvi\nLogotype](https://www.pricerunner.com/images/180x48/logos/zavvi2015.jpg)\n\nMarshall Stockwell Black\n\n\u00a3109.99](/gotostore/v1/UK/32330_26409436229?clickarea=retailer&pagetype=test)\n\n## bluetooth-speaker\n\nThere are a wide range of Bluetooth speakers available on the market today,\nbut perhaps this isn\u2019t surprising. It has become extremely easy to carry your\nmusic collection or stream music via the internet these days and recent\ntechnological developments have meant that it\u2019s easy to find a compact, light\nspeaker system that doesn\u2019t need to cost a fortune. Given that we\u2019re now all\nrunning around with about 20 million songs in our pockets, it seems like a\ncarefully selected Bluetooth speaker is a mandatory gadget to add to your home\ntechnology list!\n\nThe major advantage of Bluetooth speakers is that they are portable. The\ncombination of an inbuilt battery and wireless connectivity \u2013 normally using\nBluetooth \u2013 means that you have the freedom to play music indoors and also\ntake your speaker out into the garden. A Bluetooth connection normally allows\nfor distances of around 10m between the speaker and the streaming source. This\nrange can vary partly depending on the version of the Bluetooth protocol they\nuse and partly due to the materials and other things used in the speaker.\n\nSome of the speakers in this test are splash resistant and some are even fully\nwaterproof. This means that you can take them outdoors even when it\u2019s raining\nor when they\u2019re likely to get splashed on with water from a pool. One easy way\nto help you tell which speakers are waterproof is to look at the speaker\u2019s IP\ncode number. IP code numbers are constructed so that the first digit indicates\nthe level of protection against foreign objects, such as dust, and the second\ndigit indicates protection against water. The higher the figure, the better\nthe protection. For example, an IP56 code indicates the speaker has protection\nagainst dust and powerful jets of water, while IP44 indicates that a steel\nwire of 1 mm cannot penetrate the unit and that it is protected against\nsplashes of water. If the figure is 0, the speaker has no protection from the\nelements. In our test, we chose to focus on how waterproof the speakers were,\nas portable speakers are often used by water.\n\nWaterproof IP code guide:\n\n  * None = IPX0\n  * Low = IPX1-IPX3\n  * Medium = IPX4-IPX6\n  * High = IPX7<\n\nA low waterproofing score means that you should avoid soaking the unit but\nalso means that it won\u2019t hurt it if it gets dripped on. A medium waterproofing\nscore means the unit can cope with more severe soakings for longer periods,\nincluding pouring rain or splashes from the pool. If the waterproofing score\nis high, you should actually be able to take the speaker into the pool with\nyou!\n\nNFC (Near Field Communication) is another exciting feature that many Bluetooth\nspeakers have. This means you can connect two speaker units together simply by\ntouching them together. Both units must support NFC for this to work, however.\nOnce connected, a Bluetooth connection will be used for the actual transfer of\ndata between the units.\n\n## Buying the right Bluetooth speaker\n\nWhen you buy a Bluetooth speaker, it\u2019s important that you choose a model that\nhas the right combination of a long battery life, a high sound quality and an\nattractive design to suit your preferences. Often you will have to compromise\nbetween sound quality, battery life and features if you're looking at speakers\nin the lower price class. Of course, the design of the speaker is an important\nfeature for many people and this is an area where the speakers vary massively.\nThere are larger speaker models that are intended to be stand in a single\nplace and look pretty and there are smaller models that are meant to be\ncarried around and used in different locations. Often you\u2019ll find the same\nspeaker model is available in a range of different colours so you can choose\nthe colour that you like.\n\n## Post a comment\n\nStick to the topic and maintain a respectful attitude toward others.
