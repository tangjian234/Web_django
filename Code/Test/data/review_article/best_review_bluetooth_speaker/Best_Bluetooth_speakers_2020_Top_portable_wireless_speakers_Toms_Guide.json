These wireless speakers pack rich sound into\nhighly portable designs, often complete with rich feature sets for jamming out\nwhile outdoors.\n\nEven if you enjoy most of your music inside, the best Bluetooth speakers make\na great addition to any audio setup. They offer a huge upgrade from your\nphone's tinny built-in speakers, and range in price from premium high-end\nmodels to great speakers that cost less than $50.\n\n  * The [best soundbars](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-soundbar-speakers,review-2004.html) for your home theater setup\n  * Here are the [best outdoor speakers](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-outdoor-speakers,review-2785.html) you can buy\n  * The [best computer speakers](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-computer-speakers,review-6355.html)\n\nBluetooth speakers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from pocket-friendly\nportable models to massive speakers for your backyard or patio. Many of the\ntop Bluetooth speakers support Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing you to\ncontrol music playback, check the weather or start a call using intuitive\nvoice commands. Better yet, lots of Bluetooth speakers are water- and dust\nresistant, meaning you can jam out by the pool without having to worry about\ndamaging your device.\n\nSee all of our best Bluetooth speaker picks below.\n\n## What is the best Bluetooth speaker?\n\nWe think the best Bluetooth speaker of all the models we\u2019ve tested is the UE\nMegaboom 3. It lands in the sweet spot of offering nearly everything you\u2019d\nwant out of a Bluetooth speaker at a reasonable price point. The Megaboom 3\nsounds great when playing all genres of music, offers an impressive 20 hours\nof playback and is sturdy enough to face the elements outdoors. It\u2019ll even\nsurvive an accidental drop in the pool.\n\nThe best Bluetooth speaker for those on a budget is the Anker SoundCore 2. For\n$40, the SoundCore 2 delivers loud sound in a durable, compact body. While\nit\u2019s a bit small for the average backyard party, it\u2019s great to toss in your\nbag for a beach venture or other outing. Plus its 24 battery life will survive\nany day trip you have in mind.\n\nIf money is no object, the massive, $399 Sonos Move has the most features of\nany Bluetooth speaker we\u2019ve tested. Its booming sound and clever carrying grip\nmake it the ultimate home audio companion, while its Google Assistant and\nAlexa capabilities let you control your smart home devices. The Move's Auto\nTruePlay adjusts the speaker\u2019s output settings to make it sound the best for\nthe space it\u2019s in, whether that\u2019s your patio, deck, backyard or bedroom.\n\nFor a less expensive option of a Bluetooth speaker with smarts, the JBL Link\n20 is a reliable choice. The Link 20 sounds as premium as the best Bluetooth\nspeaker and provides a reasonable 10 hours of battery life. It\u2019s waterproof,\ntoo, meaning you can bring Google Assistant in the pool with you next time you\ngo for a dip.\n\nThere are plenty of new Bluetooth speakers worth keeping on your radar as\nwell, including the new Marshall Emberton. This compact speaker fits in the\npalm of your hand, offers rich 360-degree sound and packs IPX7 water\nresistance for handling any tumbles into the pool.\n\nRead on for all of our best Bluetooth speaker picks.\n\n## The best Bluetooth speakers right now\n\n![Best Bluetooth speaker: UE Megaboom\n3](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: UE)\n\n### 1\\.

And with an IPX7-rated design, it can survive drops, splashes and a\nfall into the pool without skipping a beat.\n\nThe Megaboom 3 is a bit on the bigger side compared to other portable\nspeakers, and unlike many of its competitors, it doesn't have Alexa or Google\nAssistant support or other smart features. But if that\u2019s not a dealbreaker,\nthe Megaboom 3's sound quality and ruggedness can't be beat for the price.

While a number of wired speakers like the Amazon Echo provide excellent\nBluetooth listening, you can\u2019t bring them outside your kitchen or living room.\nStick to a speaker with a rechargeable battery for on-the-go audio.\n\nWith that, you\u2019ll need to decide if an option with a voice assistant is the\nbest Bluetooth speaker for you. If you plan to use your speaker in your\nbackyard, it could be useful to have Google Assistant\u2019s or Alexa\u2019s powers at\nyour disposal. That way you can change the music using your voice, rather than\ncontrolling the audio through your phone. These smart features will not work\nbeyond your home\u2019s Wi-Fi, so opt for a non-smart Bluetooth speaker for the\nbeach or other outdoorsy locales.\n\n## How we test the best Bluetooth speakers\n\nEvery product on this list is considered the best Bluetooth speaker for one or\nmore standout features, however each must meet basic requirements during our\ntesting to be considered. We spend several hours listening to music, making\ncalls and toting around every speaker to make sure it sounds great across all\ngenres, provides solid call quality and withstands minor bumps or splashes.\n\nIf a speaker offers smart features, we enable the supported voice assistant to\nsee how it fares against other top rated smart speakers. We\u2019ll use it to\ncontrol smart home devices, browse playlists and get answers to other common\nqueries.\n\nWe also test battery life, exhausting each speaker\u2019s battery after a full\ncharge to see how long it can last under realistic conditions. A smart speaker\nconnected to Wi-Fi should last at least 10 hours, while a standard Bluetooth\nspeaker should last around 20. Most people want to know how much play time\nthey can expect when their speaker is brought along for a day trip.\n\n  * [_Best Google Home speakers_](https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-google-home-speakers)\n  * [ _Best cheap Bluetooth speakers_](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/918-best-cheap-bluetooth-speakers.html)\n\nRound up of today's best deals\n\nUltimate Ears MEGABOOM 3...\n\n[Ultimate Ears Megaboom\n3](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB087C9GYKL%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-\nus-5467520849184940000-20)\n\nAmazon\n\n[$109.99](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB087C9GYKL%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-\nus-5467520849184940000-20)\n\n[View](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB087C9GYKL%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-\nus-5467520849184940000-20)\n\n[See all\nprices](https://www.tomsguide.com/deals/compare?model_name=Ultimate%20Ears%20Megaboom%203)\n\nAnker Soundcore 2 Portable...\n\n[Anker SoundCore\n2](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB074NS9P2J%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-\nus-7409161447178020000-20)\n\nAmazon\n\n[$31.99](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB074NS9P2J%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-\nus-7409161447178020000-20)\n\n[View](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB074NS9P2J%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-\nus-7409161447178020000-20)\n\n[See all\nprices](https://www.tomsguide.com/deals/compare?model_name=Anker%20SoundCore%202)\n\nUltimate Ears -
