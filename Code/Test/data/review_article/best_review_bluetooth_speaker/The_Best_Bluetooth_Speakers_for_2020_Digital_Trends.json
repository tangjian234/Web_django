When we tell you what the best Bluetooth\nspeakers are, we want to make sure we\u2019ve covered all our bases first.\n\nWe\u2019ve listened to these speakers outside, in the car, at work, and at home.\nThere have been plenty of stand-outs, but there are a few reasons why the\nUltimate Ears Megaboom 3 Speaker has made it to first place.\n\n## **The best Bluetooth speakers at a glance**\n\n  * Best Bluetooth speaker overall: Ultimate Ears Megaboom 3\n  * Best cheap Bluetooth speaker: Oontz Angle\n  * Best high-end Bluetooth speaker: Riva Festival\n  * Best rugged Bluetooth speaker: JBL Flip 4\n  * Best portable Bluetooth speaker: Ultimate Ears Wonderboom\n  * Best multiroom-capable Bluetooth speaker: Sonos Move\n\n### The best Bluetooth speaker: Ultimate Ears Megaboom 3\n\n![ultimate ears megaboom 3 front\nfull](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)  \n**Why should you buy this?** It offers gorgeous looks, a slew of features, and\ngreat performance.\n\n**Who\u2019s it for?** Everyone who wants great sound on the go.\n\n**Why we picked the Ultimate Ears Megaboom 3:**\n\nUltimate Ears has spent the better part of the last decade developing some of\nthe best-sounding, sharpest-looking, and most rugged Bluetooth speakers on the\nmarket. There is no product that better embodies this ethos than the Megaboom\n3.\n\nWhile it offers plenty of enticing features, perhaps the most impressive\nfeature of the Megaboom 3 is just how life-proof it is. It\u2019s got a specially\ndesigned fabric that can take a licking while still looking sharp. It\u2019s also\ndustproof and waterproof, even being able to be submerged in water up to three\nfeet for 30 minutes. Its two-year warranty should put to rest any concerns\naround testing these capabilities. All that, plus it\u2019s got up to 20 hours of\nbattery life for extended listening on the go.\n\nThe Megaboom 3 projects sound all around it, easily filling your space with\nyour favorite tunes. With vibrant highs and authoritative bass, it even\ncompetes with many non-portable options when it comes to fidelity. And it\u2019s\ngot something called the \u201cMagic Button\u201d, which allows you to change playlists\nand tracks when your phone is out of reach. If you are looking for a new Swiss\nArmy knife of sound to take with you anywhere, this is the best you\u2019ll find.\n\n**[Read our full Ultimate Ears Megaboom 3\nreview](https://www.digitaltrends.com/wireless-speaker-reviews/ultimate-ears-\nmegaboom-3-review/)**\n\n### **The best cheap Bluetooth speaker: Oontz Angle**\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n**Why should you buy this?** It\u2019s cheap, water-resistant, and sounds great for\nthe money.\n\n**Who\u2019s it for?** Those in need of a speaker that\u2019s affordable, compact, and\nworry-free.\n\n**Why we picked the Oontz Angle:**\n\nIf you\u2019re not trying to get audiophile-grade sound, throw your speaker\nstraight into the pool, or tap into your savings account to bring your\nfavorite tunes with you on the go, the Oontz Angle is a great choice.\n\nOne of the most popular choices on Amazon, the Angle \u2014 now in its third\ngeneration \u2014 came to our attention when we were looking for a cheap speaker to\ntake into the bathroom while showering. With good bass response, a water-\nresistant design, and up to 14 hours of battery life, this cheap little\nspeaker offers insane value at its low price.\n\nIts Bluetooth 4.2 antenna offers up to 100 feet of range, and the Angle even\nhas a 3.5 mm AUX port, should you want to plug into it. You can certainly pay\nmore for a Bluetooth speaker, but the Oontz Angle proves you don\u2019t have to.\n\n### The best high-end Bluetooth speaker: Riva Festival\n\n![Riva Festival Bluetooth\nspeaker](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n**Why should you buy this?** It offers excellent stereophonic sound, multiroom\nfunctionality, and support for high-resolution audio playback.\n\n**Who\u2019s it for?** Those willing to shell out a little extra dough for\nexquisite performance.\n\n**Why we picked the Riva Festival:**\n\nIn 2017, [Riva debuted](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/riva-audio-\nwand-series-multi-space-audio-system/) its WAND (Wireless Audio Network\nDesign) line of speakers, comprising the $250 Arena and the $500 Festival.\n[WAND](https://rivaaudio.com/wand/) is a wireless protocol that connects\nmultiple speakers across large spaces or in separate rooms, similar to Sonos\u2019\nproprietary system or JBL\u2019s Connect Plus.\n\nThe Festival boasts just about every connectivity feature under the sun. Along\nwith Bluetooth, the speaker can connect over Wi-Fi, including AirPlay, DLNA,\nand DDMS. The Festival supports several direct streaming options as well,\nincluding Spotify Connect, plus it\u2019s Google Cast-ready for instant streaming\nfrom multiple apps.\n\nAll that aside, the real reason you\u2019ll want to consider the Riva Festival is\nits audio performance. Packed with seven ADX drivers powered by 200 watts,\nsix-channel amplification with advanced digital signal processing (DSP), and a\ntotal of four passive radiators, it produces sound as clear, crisp, and\npowerful as you\u2019ll hear from a wireless speaker in this price range. Riva\u2019s\nADX Trillium stereophonic DSP system manages to project music across a wide\nsoundstage with effortless clarity, and the Festival is built to handle pretty\nmuch any audio codec you can think of \u2014 even hi-res lossless codecs like FLAC\nand ALAC.\n\nWhen it comes to design, the Festival is a bit on the boring side (especially\nconsidering its name), but that\u2019s a minor complaint and a trait that many will\nappreciate. We\u2019ll give a shout-out to [Bowers & Wilkins\u2019\nT7,](https://www.digitaltrends.com/music/bowers-wilkins-burberry-t7-bluetooth-\nspeaker/) the [Mass Fidelity Core](https://www.digitaltrends.com/wireless-\nspeaker-reviews/mass-fidelity-core-review/), and the [Marshall Stanmore II\nVoice](https://www.digitaltrends.com/speaker-reviews/marshall-stanmore-ii-\nvoice-review/), but they just can\u2019t beat the Festival.\n\n**[Read our full Riva Festival review](https://www.digitaltrends.com/wireless-\nspeaker-reviews/riva-festival-multiroom-speaker-review/)**\n\n### The best rugged Bluetooth speaker: JBL Flip 5\n\n![JBL Flip 5 waterproof Bluetooth\nspeaker](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n**Why should you buy this?** It offers great sound in a rugged, portable, and\naffordable package.\n\n**Who\u2019s it for?** Those who want versatility and serious durability on a\nbudget.\n\n**Why we picked the JBL Flip 5:**\n\nWhen it comes to wireless audio, durability is a big factor for those always\non the move. After all, taking your sound _everywhere_ is kind of the big\nseller for Bluetooth. JBL\u2019s Flip 5 fits that bill, and it\u2019s more than just\nanother run-of-the-mill waterproof option.\n\nJBL significantly upped the Flip 5\u2019s power when compared to the earlier\nfourth-generation of this speaker. With more than double the power of the\n[Flip 4](https://www.digitaltrends.com/wireless-speaker-reviews/jbl-\nflip-4-review/), the Flip 5 get impressively loud, while generating a copious\namount of bass.\n\nLike the Flip 4, it is [waterproof with an IPX7\nrating](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/what-is-ip-water-\nresistance-headphones-speakers/), meaning you can submerge the speaker in a\nmeter of water for up to 30 minutes. Battery life, while not massive at 12\nhours, is still plenty for an entire day\u2019s worth of tunes.\n\nUsing JBL\u2019s PartyBoost feature, you can link two PartyBoost-compatible\nspeakers for stereo sound, or link even more for a synchronized sound that can\nbe spread around a whole house (or pool party).\n\nWant to make a fashion statement with your speaker? When you [buy the Flip 5\nfrom\nJBL.com](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/2942700/type/dlg/https://www.jbl.com/bluetooth-\nspeakers/JBL+FLIP+5-.html) you can order it in one of 12 colors, or you can\nhave it [custom-printed with a photo](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-\ntheater/jbl-bluetooth-speakers-headphones-personalization-photo-printing/)\nthat you upload to the JBL site. This option costs a bit more, but no one will\never be able to claim it isn\u2019t _your_ speaker.\n\nThe Flip 5 is the right choice for a durable go-anywhere Bluetooth speaker for\nthose who place a premium on big, bold sound, However, the Flip 4 might be a\nbetter option for some. With its speakerphone function, voice assistant-\nbutton, and line-in capability, it trades absolute power for enhanced\npracticality. It\u2019s cheaper too.\n\n### The best portable Bluetooth speaker: Ultimate Ears Wonderboom\n\n### **![UE Wonderboom\nBluetooth](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)  \n**\n\n**Why should you buy this?** Inch for inch, it\u2019s the most capable micro-\nspeaker you can find that still produces decent sound.\n\n**Who\u2019s it for?** Those who value portability, but aren\u2019t willing to sacrifice\nsound quality or durability.\n\n**Why we picked the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom:**\n\nMini Bluetooth speakers often suffer from terrible audio quality and volume\nlevels that simply can\u2019t keep up with their larger cousins. The Ultimate Ears\nWonderboom defies this tendency and does it in a fully floating, waterproof\npackage.\n\nWhile its bass performance and overall power can\u2019t quite match that of the JBL\nFlip 5, the Wonderboom is shockingly good considering its diminutive size.\nUltimate Ears speakers are known for being minimalist in design, and the\nWonderboom is no exception. With only two buttons \u2014 for volume up/down \u2014 there\nisn\u2019t even a visible battery life indicator (instead you get an audio prompt\nwith three different tones). Still, it\u2019s hard to find fault with that\nconsidering the sound, the ruggedness, the size, and mostly the price of the\nWonderboom. You should be able to find it for less than $75.\n\n**[Read our full Ultimate Ears Wonderboom\nreview](https://www.digitaltrends.com/wireless-speaker-reviews/ultimate-ears-\nwonderboom-bluetooth-review/)**\n\n### The best multiroom-capable Bluetooth speaker: Sonos Move\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n**Why should you buy this?** It\u2019s a Sonos speaker that can also do double-duty\nas a rechargeable portable Bluetooth speaker. Need we say more?\n\n**Who\u2019s it for?** Sonos owners who want a portable Bluetooth speaker that will\nwork with their whole-home sound system.\n\n**Why we picked the Sonos Move:**\n\nMultiroom audio is something several companies claim their wireless speakers\ncan do, but we\u2019ve never come across a multiroom system that is as easy to use\nor as powerful as Sonos. So when Sonos finally introduced a battery-powered\nportable speaker that can effortlessly switch between Wi-Fi-based whole-home\naudio and go-anywhere Bluetooth connectivity, we were all ears.\n\nThe Sonos Move is pricey at $399, but it justifies that price through a build\nquality that goes well beyond most of the products on this list. Despite\nlooking like the rest of the Sonos line of indoor-only speakers, the Move is\njust at home outside, with an IP56 rating for dust and water-resistance. That\nmeans pool parties, unexpected rainstorms, or even trips to the beach are no\nproblem for the Move. Just don\u2019t immerse it in water \u2014 it isn\u2019t waterproof.\n\nIt has a big, bold sound that easily fills a room with warmth and depth.\nCleverly, the Move integrates a new form of Sonos\u2019 excellent [TruePlay EQ\ntechnology](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/sonos-trueplay-first-\nimpressions-review/) \u2014 one which requires no user intervention. It simply\nmeasures the room acoustics via the built-in mics and adjusts accordingly, and\nwill do so every time you move it.\n\nOf course, those mics would be under-utilized if they were only for Auto-\nTruePlay. They also serve as your smart speaker interface. Like the [Sonos\nOne](https://www.digitaltrends.com/wireless-speaker-reviews/sonos-one-review/)\nand [Sonos Beam](https://www.digitaltrends.com/sound-bar-reviews/sonos-beam-\nreview/), you get a choice of Alexa or Google Assistant. This won\u2019t work when\nusing Bluetooth, but it\u2019s pretty handy when at home.\n\nThe Move\u2019s battery is good for 10 hours of use between charges, which is\nfrankly a little underwhelming for a portable speaker. But we have to give\nSonos props for its decision to make the battery user-replaceable \u2014 a rarity\nin this category and a huge help in keeping the Move from an [early trip to\nthe landfill](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/sonos-users-angry-\nover-trade-up-program-old-speakers/).\n\nFilling out the Move\u2019s benefits is [AirPlay\n2](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/apple-airplay-2-explained/),\nwhich lets you stream directly to the speaker from any iOS device or MacOS\ncomputer. It\u2019s a higher stream quality than Bluetooth and makes the Move an\nideal source for better-than-iPad sound quality for YouTube, Netflix,\n[Disney+](https://www.digitaltrends.com/topic/disney-plus/) or any other video\nsource you can think of.\n\nIf we have one criticism of the Move it\u2019s that you don\u2019t actually want to move\nit much. It\u2019s very heavy compared to every other portable model on this list\nand its built-in carry handle isn\u2019t comfortable for anything beyond a trip\nfrom the kitchen to the patio.\n\n**[Read our full Sonos Move review](https://www.digitaltrends.com/speaker-\nreviews/sonos-move-review/)**\n\n### **How we test**\n\nWe test Bluetooth speakers the way normal people live.\n\nWe run every speaker through a rigorous process over the course of several\ndays. That includes playing them in all sorts of scenarios, be it in the park\nor at the beach (for portables), in the listening room, or at the office, and\nplaying back from our device library and streaming services like Spotify. We\nalso test range, connection stability, and interference in areas with a lot of\nradio frequency interference (i.e. the Digital Trends offices).\n\nFinally, we compare each speaker to some of our go-to models, both in their\nclass and price point, as well as a level or two above to find out if they can\npunch above their weight.\n\n### **How to decipher Bluetooth speaker terms**\n\n  * **NFC:** Shorthand for Near Field Communication, this oft-touted feature is actually quite limited when it comes to Bluetooth speakers, allowing select phones to pair with a speaker with a quick touch. Since pairing is often as simple as pressing a button, and speakers will be remembered by your device once paired, it\u2019s not seen as a must-have feature.\n  * **AptX:** Another feature limited to phones and devices outside of Apple\u2019s periphery, AptX is a codec (or group of codecs) said to allow Bluetooth streaming at \u201cnear CD quality\u201d resolution. Apple products do not use AptX, but Android users may find it improves performance when paired with high-quality tracks and high-performance speakers. [AptX Adaptive](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/qualcomm-aptx-adaptive-news/) is the latest and greatest version of this codec, but both source device and Bluetooth speaker must support it for you to get any benefit.\n  * **Passive radiator:** **** A passive radiator is a type of driver used to enhance bass in a speaker. In a sealed speaker enclosure (no portholes) a passive radiator responds to fluctuations in air pressure within the enclosure, creating sound. Since a passive radiator doesn\u2019t have to be powered by an amp, it has no magnet or voice coil and is therefore lighter and smaller than a traditional driver. This saves space and cost while increasing the speaker\u2019s performance.\n  * **Pairing (or Bluetooth pairing):** In the case of Bluetooth speakers, pairing is the act of making a wireless connection from a speaker to your wireless device via Bluetooth.\n  * **IPXX:** IP stands for \u201cIngress Protection,\u201d and this rating denotes how resistant a device is to dust (first number) and water (second). For instance, a device with an IP67 rating is dust-tight and allows water submersion up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes. The higher the numbers, the better the protection you get. If you plan to take your Bluetooth speaker near water, the minimum you should go is IPX7.
