These speakers\nare big and loud, blend in seamlessly with natural surroundings, and can\nhandle rain, wind and dust while powering your yard and patio with your\nfavorite tunes.\n\nMany of the best outdoor speakers now work with the likes of Alexa and Google\nAssistant, so you can play your favorite tracks or ask for the weather or the\nnews with a quick voice command. And outdoor speakers come in all shapes and\nsizes, whether you need something portable for the beach or pool or a massive\nmodel for bigger get-togethers.\n\n  * Need something smaller? Check out the [best Bluetooth speaker](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-bluetooth-speakers,review-1982.html) right now\n  * Here are the [best soundbars](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-soundbar-speakers,review-2004.html) for upgrading your home theater\n  * [4th of July sales](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/90-best-4th-of-july-sales-happening-right-now): The best deals to get now\n\nOutdoor speakers can be a bit on the premium side, but you're getting what you\npay for in terms of size, sound quality and, most importantly, durability and\nlongevity. If you're ready to take your outdoor audio setup to the next level,\nread on for all of our best outdoor speakers picks.\n\n## What are the best outdoor speakers?\n\nThe best outdoor speakers combine great sound, durable construction and\nhelpful features, but won\u2019t break the bank as you outfit your backyard or\npatio. The speakers on our list all meet these criteria, though they each have\ntheir pros and cons.\n\nWhen you\u2019re shopping for an outdoor speaker, you\u2019re likely looking for very\ndifferent things than for an indoor speaker. With most indoor speakers, you\ndon\u2019t need to worry about weather-proofing (unless you need a shower speaker).\nYou also may not care about the distortion levels at the loudest end, since\nyou might rarely turn up the volume to its highest setting.\n\nBased on our testing, the best outdoor speaker right now is the Polk Atrium 4,\nwhich offers quality audio and a sturdy design for a good price. The Atrium\nseries continues to impress. The Atrium 4 are fairly small but deliver full\nsound. And if you want more bass, the larger Atrium 5 set is also great if\nyou\u2019re willing to pay more.\n\nThe Dual LU53 is a great budget option that pumps out quality sound for around\n$50. It produces both rich bass and clear vocals, making it a top option for\nplaying music at parties.\n\nIf you want to go bigger and louder, we like the Klipsch AW-650, which has\nthunderous bass with crisp vocals and are among the sturdiest outdoor speakers\nyou can get. Then there\u2019s the Klipsch AWR-650-SM Outdoor Rock, which is\ndesigned to blend seamlessly into your backyard, though they are fairly\nexpensive.\n\nIf you want a smart outdoor speaker, the Sonos Move is a robust portable\nBluetooth speaker that features Alexa and Google Assistant voice controls.\nSonos even launched its own streaming radio service (dubbed simply Sonos\nRadio), making the Move a better option than ever for rocking out outside. We\nalso recommend the UE Megaboom 3 if you want a small, wireless outdoor speaker\nthat still sounds great.\n\nRead on for all of our picks for the best outdoor speakers.\n\n## The best outdoor speakers available now\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\n### 1\\.

These\nmonsters of rock measure 15 x 11 x 9.5 inches and feature a 6.5-inch woofer\nand 1-inch tweeter. The result is thunderous bass and crisp, full vocals that\ncan easily overpower the ambient noise of the outdoors when you want.\n\nThe AW-650 speakers are built like a tank, with a UV-resistant ABS plastic\npolymer enclosure that's backed by Klipsch's lifetime warranty. And at 9\npounds each, you'll want to make sure you securely mount them if you choose to\nplace them up high; they would also work well at floor level.\n\nBut all that power will cost you: A pair of AW-650s runs between $360 and $400\non Amazon.  \n\n![Best outdoor speakers: Dual\nLU53](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 3\\.

Add support for all major\nstreaming services on top of all that and you have the ultimate outdoor\nportable speaker.\n\n_Read our full_[ __Sonos Move\nreview__](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/sonos-move) _._\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: UE)\n\n### 5\\.

The AWR-650-SM is more than part garden decor and part undercover\nagent; like our premium pick, the Klipsch AW-650, it also delivers spectacular\nsound.\n\nThe housings of these ingeniously designed speakers are made to resemble\n17-inch-high hunks of either sandstone or granite, depending on the overall\naesthetic of your patio or garden. The undersides are slathered with sealant,\nand the wiring is thick and waterproof. But on the inside, Klipsch has packed\nthese faux boulders with punch: Dual 0.75-inch tweeters and a 6.5-inch woofer\ndeliver superior sound quality, with brass that pops and bass that comes in\nheavy and authoritative.\n\nThe biggest knock on these rocks? Price. Each one will set you back almost\n$300, and they really should be experienced as a pair. The 13-pound weight is\nnot terribly heavy, but these are clunky to carry. (They are, in essence,\nlarge rocks, and need to be handled as such.) But if you're willing to go the\ndistance for maximum outdoor sound and minimal footprints around your grounds,\npony up a few extra clams for these secret speakers.  \n\n## How to choose the best outdoor speakers for you\n\nAs you shop for outdoor speakers, the first thing you\u2019ll want to look for is\nweather-proofing. Outdoor speakers should be completely weatherproof or at\nleast rated IPX7 or above. The next thing you\u2019ll want to consider is how the\nspeakers will be connected. Many outdoor speakers are wired, so you\u2019ll need a\npower source. If that\u2019s not doable in your backyard or patio, then you will\nwant to concentrate on portable Bluetooth speakers.\n\nNext, think about how big your space is and what kind of volume level you\u2019ll\nrequire. If you have a small patio or mainly want music for dinner parties, a\nsmaller set of outdoor speakers may be perfectly adequate. But if you have a\nlarge suburban backyard or want to host crowded dance parties, you may want to\nshop for larger speakers with more audio capacity.\n\nLast but not least, there\u2019s cost to consider. Outdoor speakers can get pricey,\nas they need to be tough and rugged enough to withstand the elements. You can\nstill find great sets at any budget level. Note that Bluetooth speakers are\ngenerally going to be more expensive.\n\n## How we test best outdoor speakers\n\nFor the best outdoor speakers, we look at a number of factors. We start with\naudio quality: how bass, mid-range, treble and vocals sound. Are they\nbalanced? What kind of woofer, midrange driver and tweeter do the speakers\nhave? We also look at size and range to determine how the outdoor speaker will\nsound in different settings, from a large backyard to a smaller patio or deck.\nWill the speaker be able to fill various areas or are they better in certain\nset-ups?\n\nNext, since these are outdoor speakers, we have to take weatherproofing into\nconsideration. Are they temperature and water resistant? Does the speaker\u2019s\nhousing ward off against bugs and dust? Other factors include how easy it is\nto mount the speakers and to use any included features like smart technology.\n\nAnd we want to test a variety of outdoor speakers at different price points,\nso that we can recommend one for every type of budget.\n\n  * The [best Alexa speakers](https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-alexa-speakers) for your needs\n  * What are the [best computer speakers](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-computer-speakers,review-6355.html) to get?\n\nRound up of today's best deals\n\nPolk Audio Atrium4 Outdoor...\n\n[Polk Audio Atrium 4\nSpeaker](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB00378KMEG%3FlinkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-us-3805514979616604000-20)\n\nAmazon\n\n[$115.97](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB00378KMEG%3FlinkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-us-3805514979616604000-20)\n\n[View](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB00378KMEG%3FlinkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-us-3805514979616604000-20)\n\n[See all\nprices](https://www.tomsguide.com/deals/compare?model_name=Polk%20Audio%20Atrium%204%20Speaker)\n\nKlipsch AW-650 Indoor/Outdoor...\n\n[Klipsch\nAW-650](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB00096ZRJ4%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-\nus-8506885173017961000-20)\n\nAmazon\n\n[$499.99](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB00096ZRJ4%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-\nus-8506885173017961000-20)\n\n[View](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB00096ZRJ4%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-\nus-8506885173017961000-20)\n\n[See all\nprices](https://www.tomsguide.com/deals/compare?model_name=Klipsch%20AW-650)\n\nDual Electronics LU53PW 5 \u00bc...\n\n[Dual\nLU53](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDual-\nElectronics-LU53PW-Performance-\nBookshelf%2Fdp%2FB00081UPLK%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Delectronics%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1519753606%26sr%3D1-1%26keywords%3Ddual%2Blu53pw%26tag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-us-7540652170835792000-20)\n\nAmazon\n\n[$63.36](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDual-\nElectronics-LU53PW-Performance-\nBookshelf%2Fdp%2FB00081UPLK%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Delectronics%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1519753606%26sr%3D1-1%26keywords%3Ddual%2Blu53pw%26tag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-us-7540652170835792000-20)\n\n[View](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDual-\nElectronics-LU53PW-Performance-\nBookshelf%2Fdp%2FB00081UPLK%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Delectronics%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1519753606%26sr%3D1-1%26keywords%3Ddual%2Blu53pw%26tag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-us-7540652170835792000-20)\n\n[See all\nprices](https://www.tomsguide.com/deals/compare?model_name=Dual%20LU53)\n\nSonos Move -
