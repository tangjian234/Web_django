Hence we\u2019ve\ncompiled this guide to the loudest Bluetooth speakers on the planet right now.\n\nFrom the loudest down to the loud-but-not-as-loud, this guide will help you\ndecide which Bluetooth speaker is the right fit \u2013 and is capable of hitting\nthe right volume \u2013 for you and your music collection.\n\n  * The [best budget noise cancelling headphones](https://www.loudersound.com/features/best-budget-noise-cancelling-headphones) you can buy right now\n  * The [best music streaming services](https://www.loudersound.com/features/best-music-streaming-services-online): Tidal, Spotify and more face-off\n  * The [best phones for music lovers](https://www.loudersound.com/features/best-smartphones-for-music): plus the best phone deals\n\n## Loudest Bluetooth speakers: The Louder Choice\n\nHere\u2019s the quick and dirty for you.

Not unlike an earthquake, the higher up on a scale, the more\nexponentially powerful the sound is.\n\nEvery 10 dB represents a 10-fold increase \u2013 or doubling \u2013 in volume. For\nexample, 20dB is 10 times louder than 10 dB, while 30 dB is 100x louder than\n10 dB and \u2013 with that logic in mind \u2013 1,000x more powerful than 0 dB. For\nreference, the average concert has an intensity of about 100 dB.\n\n  * [Best headphones under \u00a3100](https://www.loudersound.com/features/best-headphone-under-100): true wireless, Bluetooth and noise cancelling\n  * [Best headphones for vinyl](https://www.loudersound.com/features/best-headphones-for-vinyl): bring the best in your wax\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about Wattage (W) \u2013 because all that sound needs to be backed\nby power. But how many watts do you really need? Every speaker is set at its\nown wattage, telling us exactly the strength of its perceived amplification.\nHowever, a 100W speaker isn\u2019t twice as loud as a 50W speaker, but rather 3dB\nlouder.\n\nNow that you know what you\u2019re looking for in terms of loudness, here\u2019s our\nguide to the victors of volume, the number ones of noise... the loudest\nBluetooth speakers around. Our price comparison widgets have found the best\nprices online right now for you, too.\n\n## The loudest bluetooth speakers you can buy right now\n\n![Loudest Bluetooth speakers: The New\nSoundBoks](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/loudersound/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\n(Image credit: SoundBoks)\n\n### 1\\.

One of the\ngreat things about SoundBoks is how accessible this speaker is from the casual\nlistener to the hardened musician. Stream music via Bluetooth or plug in your\nelectric guitar. Either way is good for this behemoth.\n\nIf your goal is to throw a party once everything gets back to normal, it\u2019s\nworth noting the speaker's ability to daisy chain connect with up to four\nother New SoundBoks speakers. On one hand, that could be enough to start your\nown makeshift rock festival.

In this case, delivering up to 90dB of sound \u2013 as loud as a\nrevved-up lawn mower \u2013 the Echo Studio does a very good job of shaking that\nnotion.\n\nIt\u2019s unlike other conventional Bluetooth speakers due to the positioning of\nits five speakers: there's a midrange speaker directed upwards, a midrange\nspeaker facing to the right and another to the left, a tweeter directed\nforward, and a woofer directed downwards towards the hollowed-out space which\nApple calls the bass aperture. These placements are meant to give listeners an\nimmersive experience \u2013 as if you are surrounded by sound.\n\nAs a smart home device, users get the perks of software updates, plus the\nability to connect to a whole host of other smart home devices. It\u2019s worth\nnoting that this speaker is designed for use within a home setting, not for\noutdoor use.\n\nAll in all, the Amazon Echo Studio may not be the choice for someone looking\nfor a pro-level speaker, however it is a great speaker for someone who wants\nan all-in-one device with great audio.\n\n![Loudest Bluetooth speakers: Marshall Woburn\nII](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/loudersound/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Marshall)\n\n### 3\\.

How loud? Well considering 30W generally is enough\nto power 100dB \u2013 about the volume you\u2019d get at your local cinema \u2013 that\u2019s\nplenty loud.\n\nDespite its sleek design, it\u2019s actually more rugged than it looks. For one,\nIt\u2019s IPX7-rated, meaning it\u2019s completely waterproof, snowproof and beer-proof.\nThat's a major plus if you find yourself wanting to bring music to the\noutdoors space.\n\nSome other bonus perks include a 24-hour charge and chain-tethering\ncapabilities with other JBL speakers. At this price point, you could invest in\ntwo Boomboxes to tether together for the price of one New SoundBoks. But let\u2019s\nbe real, one is powerful enough for the average person.\n\n![Loudest Bluetooth speakers: Bose S1 Pro\nSystem](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/loudersound/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Bose)\n\n### 5\\.

This combo of power and\nvolume makes it perfect for outdoor parties or spacious indoor venues. Its\nBluetooth connectivity and app come in handy for easy streaming and tethering\nwith other Bose Bluetooth speakers.\n\nThis speaker may be better suited to musicians due to its auto EQ technology,\nbuilt-in three-channel mixer, multiple inputs and outputs for connecting with\nother speakers and electric instruments. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not waterproof or\nresistant, and the 9 metre wireless range is kind of short.\n\nAs a pro-level speaker, it fits the needs of any musician just fine. For the\naverage listener it won\u2019t disappoint with its rumbling bass.

Two 5 \u00bc-inch woofers deliver rumbling bass boosted by a bass\nport. Soundcore has taken this a step further by using BassUp technology, a\ndigital signal processor that gives listeners a richer and clearer low-end. In\nother words, its bass drops lower than your average speaker.\n\nThe Rave boasts Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity, which for music-playing purposes\nmeans reliable connectivity and the ability to continue playing music up to\n240m away from the speaker itself.\n\nThe Rave sits at a moderately low price point and holds all the power and\nperks expected from a speaker that prides itself on being the loudest thing in\nthe room. At 17 kg, however, it\u2019s not the most portable thing.
