2019 | Best Portable Speakers On the Market Review\n\nJune 26, 2019August 14, 2019 [ Kyo ](https://www.chipin.com/author/kate/)\n\n![Best Portable Speakers](https://www.chipin.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/03/Best-Portable-Speakers-885x590.jpg)\n\nBluetooth tech is a godsend. We can up and haul our favorite playlist wherever\nwe want, be it the gym, the off-road track, or just milling about the home.\n\nFinding The Right Bluetooth Speaker For You\n\nAnd thankfully speaker systems haven\u2019t been left in the ever-evolving\nBluetooth dust. Now the latest generations of Bluetooth speakers are just as\nmobile as we are. And the performance isn\u2019t limited necessarily to price. As\nthe tech advances so do the product\u2019s accessibility to the public.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a food chain of relevant Bluetooth speakers\nto sort through. And that\u2019s where we come in. We\u2019ve managed to fish through\nthe overwhelming crush of Bluetooth speakers and separate the alphas from the\nbetas. There are some critical, determining factors that you should keep in\nmind before you whip off to the electronics store to purchase that new\nBluetooth speaker. A lot of it comes down simply to specs, price and mobility.\n\nHow Does It Stack Up\n\nPut on your Sleuth hat and ask yourself some serious questions about what you\nwant out of a Bluetooth speaker. Performance should be first and foremost on\nyour list of questions. Nothing demoralizes a consumer more than being duped\nby a nice slick presentation that is all bark and no bite. If the speaker\ndoesn\u2019t live up to the hype you\u2019ll be feeling it in the wallet afterward.\n\n![fugoo style best bluetooth speaker](https://www.chipin.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/03/fugoo-style-bluetooth-speaker-for-beach.jpg)\n\nThe Fugoo Style is one of the Best Bluetooth Speakers currently available\n\nSo ask yourself how strong of a performer the speaker is. What is the\nfrequency range on the speaker? Does it have a compelling range of sound,\nburrowing down into the lows and equally scaling up to reach those highs? Or\ndoes it sound like AM radio has made a comeback in a big way with no dynamic\nsound or performance to speak of? Does the speaker have a poor performance\nwhen it runs on battery power? How long does it last without recharging?\n\nWhere Do You Want To Take Your Bluetooth Speaker\n\nThen consider the speaker\u2019s mobility. Nothing cramps style more than a pair of\nspeakers that could pass for amplifiers at that huge Megadeth amphitheater\nshow. Sure they\u2019re big. But you can forget to transport them from place to\nplace. So taking size into consideration, what do you intend the speakers for?\nDo you plan to bring them with you to the beach for an outdoor barbecue? Or\nwill they be stationary in the home?\n\nGo to top\n\n### Editor Pick: Loudest Bluetooth Speakers 2019/h3>  \n\n[![Loudest Bluetooth Speakers On The Market](https://www.chipin.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/03/The-10-Loudest-Bluetooth-Speakers-On-The-\nMarket-1.jpg)](https://www.chipin.com/loudest-bluetooth-speaker/)\n\n## [The 13 Loudest Bluetooth Speakers On The Market in\n2019](https://www.chipin.com/loudest-bluetooth-speaker/)\n\nPosted: June 24, 2019\n\nWE all want speakers that go boom, plumbing down to the deepest depths while\nputting our subwoofers to the test. We also want speakers that boost each\ncello and each violin as if we are sitting front row at the orchestra. But\nit\u2019s ultimately all for naught if a Bluetooth\n\n### Please share:\n\n  * [Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/loudest-bluetooth-speaker/?share=twitter \"Click to share on Twitter\")\n  * [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/loudest-bluetooth-speaker/?share=facebook \"Click to share on Facebook\")\n  * [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/loudest-bluetooth-speaker/?share=linkedin \"Click to share on LinkedIn\")\n  * [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/loudest-bluetooth-speaker/?share=telegram \"Click to share on Telegram\")\n  * [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/loudest-bluetooth-speaker/?share=jetpack-whatsapp \"Click to share on WhatsApp\")\n  * [Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/loudest-bluetooth-speaker/?share=reddit \"Click to share on Reddit\")\n  * More\n  * \n\n  * [Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/loudest-bluetooth-speaker/?share=email \"Click to email this to a friend\")\n  * [Click to print (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/loudest-bluetooth-speaker/#print \"Click to print\")\n  *   * [Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/loudest-bluetooth-speaker/?share=tumblr \"Click to share on Tumblr\")\n  * [Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/loudest-bluetooth-speaker/?share=pinterest \"Click to share on Pinterest\")\n  *   * [Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/loudest-bluetooth-speaker/?share=pocket \"Click to share on Pocket\")\n  * [Click to share on Skype (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/loudest-bluetooth-speaker/?share=skype \"Click to share on Skype\")\n  *   * \n\n[3 comments](https://www.chipin.com/loudest-bluetooth-speaker/#comments)\n\nGo to top\n\nThen there is always the subject of your budget. Some people will say money is\nno object when it comes to finding the absolute best product on the market.\nBut now that price isn\u2019t necessarily an indicator of stellar design with the\ncurrent wave of Bluetooth speakers, there are some criteria to take into\naccount when looking at prices. How far will your buck go in finding the pick\nof the litter? A speaker that possesses the best design, best performance,\ngreat mobility, functionality and durability for its price may cost less than\na speaker that is inconsistent across the board with these qualities.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve gotten those criteria out of the way, we can lump our Bluetooth\nspeakers into two categories: truly portable speakers and the stationary\nspeakers you ultimately intend for the home or office.\n\n# Best Bluetooth Speakers\n\n**Stationary Indoor Bluetooth Speakers**\n\nSomething to consider with your choice of stationary indoor Bluetooth speakers\nis whether or not you want to pair the speaker with another to add a stereo\nsound. Some speakers allow multiple pairings so that you can even achieve a\nsurround sound effect. If looking for a solid product to add ambiance to your\nhome entertainment system, look no further than the list we\u2019ve mined from the\nconstellation of stationary indoor Bluetooth speakers orbiting out there in\nthe consumer electronics milky way.\n\n## 1. MARSHALL STANMORE\n\nMarshall has opened up its brand to a more mainstream audience with its take\non wireless speakers. Until that time it was more specifically known amongst\nmusic aficionados as the go-to brand for amps and musical instrument gear.\nFast forward to today and Marshall wants to fill your home with the same wall\nof sound it\u2019s gifted musicians over the years. The Stanmore retains the same\nguitar amp look that Marshall has cultivated through time. But that\u2019s the only\nsimilarity between the Stanmore and Marshall\u2019s vast lookbook of guitar amps.\n\n![marshall stanmore bluetooth speakers](https://www.chipin.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/03/marshall_stanmore_bluetooth_speakers.jpg)\n\nMarshall has opened up its brand to a more mainstream audience with its take\non wireless speakers.\n\nThis baby has a respectable threshold for creating near CD quality sound.\nWhile Bluetooth streams a lower audio quality sound, the Marshall Stanmore\ncomes equipped with the AptX codec which makes up for that difference. It uses\nthe 4.0 version of Bluetooth and is compatible with iOS, Android, PC, Mac,\nWindows and integrated speaker systems.\n\nAnd for the sound, it has a nice frequency range of 45Hz to 22kHz (30 Hz lower\nthan the average wireless speaker). So while you won\u2019t be causing an\nearthquake with subs you will still get some nice bass and highs during your\nlistening session. And best of all it packs a punch when it comes to volume.\nIt falls under the $400 price bracket.\n\nAs for the brass tacks, this one channel wireless speaker has two tweeters and\none woofer. It clocks in at 13.5 x 7.3 x 7 inches.\n\n## 2. BOSE SOUNDLINK III\n\nBose has created a winner of a wireless speaker in the Soundlink III. With 14\nhours of battery life generated from its rechargeable lithium-ion battery,\nyou\u2019ll be sure to listen to music uninterrupted. Its Bluetooth reaches up to\n30 feet. And it uses RCA 3.5mm inputs and a mini USB. All of these things will\ncertainly come in handy if you want to stack the speaker with another or\nseveral others in order to create a full surround sound experience.\n\n![Bose SoundLink III speaker ](https://www.chipin.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/03/Bose-SoundLink-speaker-III-speaker.jpg)\n\nThe Soundlink is a smaller speaker than the Stanmore, clocking in at 2 inches\nin width and depth and weighing no more than 3 pounds. But it makes up for\nsize with big sound. It, like the Marshall Stanmore, boasts an AptX codec to\nhelp round out that dynamic sound you are looking for. And just like the\nMarshall Stanmore the Soundlink is compatible with iOS, Android, PC, Mac and\nWindows operating systems.\n\n![Bose Soundlink 3](https://www.chipin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Bose-\nSoundLink-speaker-III-bluetooth-speaker.jpg)\n\nBose has created a winner of a wireless speaker in the Soundlink III.\n\nBut here\u2019s an interesting addition that the Marshall doesn\u2019t possess,\nspeakerphone. Should you pair your speakers with your smartphone, feel free to\naccept those incoming calls and route them through your Soundlink. Some\ndowners though about the Soundlink are no EQ app to adjust and tweak the\nsound, the limited Bluetooth distance, and Bose does not publish its frequency\nresponse for the speaker. We\u2019re assuming somewhere in the 80Hz to 20kHz range.\nNot all A\u2019s across the board but for a speaker that you can place in the home\nand only at a price of $269, it performs handily.\n\n## 3. FLUANCE Fi50\n\nHere is a genuine contender for a reasonable indoor Bluetooth speaker. The\nFluance Fi50 packs powerful sound, boasting a 5-inch woofer with a tweeter\ndead smack in its center. The Canadian speaker has a built-in 40-watt\namplifier as well.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about all that sound. While it kicks out a hefty bit of\nvolume, you won\u2019t be able to readily transport it from place to place without\nplugging it into a wall socket. There is no rechargeable unit with this one.\n\n![Fluance Fi50 Bluetooth Speaker](https://www.chipin.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/03/Fluance-Fi50-bluetooth-speaker-e1488928404585.jpg)\n\nThe Fluance Fi50 Bluetooth Speaker has a tweeter in the center of its 5-inch\nwoofer\n\nBut if you\u2019re willing to overlook that, it has some other stellar qualities\nworth taking on board. You have an adjustable LED display, ready to be dimmed\nor brightened to your needs. You also have a USB input that will allow you to\ncharge other devices like your smartphone or tablet.\n\nThe Fluance streams via the Bluetooth 2.1 version. But it does offer AptX to\nhelp boost that streaming capability. Overall it is a solid speaker with a\ndynamic sound. And at only $200 it is a nice investment for the home or\noffice.\n\n## 4. CAMBRIDGE AUDIO YOYO M\n\nThe Cambridge Audio Yoyo M is a refined specimen of a bluetooth speaker. The\nbrand cultivates a genuinely unique design aesthetic in the rendering of this\nmoderately sized 6.6-pound speaker. Instead of opting for the typical source\nmaterial like plastic, Cambridge goes the route of British wool.\n\n![Cambridge Audio YOYO M](https://www.chipin.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/03/Cambridge_Audio_YOYO_M.jpg)\n\nThe Cambridge Audio Yoyo M is a refined specimen of a bluetooth speaker.\n\nThese speakers are optimized for a stereo configuration in your home or\noffice. With a Bluetooth range of 30 feet sound fills ample space. Imagine\neven stacking these babies to generate a nice full surround sound. A full 24\nhours of battery power will keep the speakers pumping out a respectable\nfrequency range on a full charge. While like the other speakers on this list\nyou won\u2019t be blasting out tremendous subs, you will have a clear sound. They\nretail for $375.\n\n## 5. CREATIVE SOUND BLASTER ROAR 2\n\nThe Creative Sound Blaster Roar 2 is a lightweight speaker, weighing in at 3.6\npounds and not taking up more space than a normal forearm. The speaker\nresembles a little black case, something in which you might stow away your\njewels or secrets. Instead, it\u2019s a powerful speaker that goes hard in the\npaint.\n\n![Creative SoundBlaster Roar 2 wireless bluetooth\nspeaker](https://www.chipin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Creative-\nSoundBlaster-Roar2-wireless-bluetooth-speaker.jpg)\n\nThe Creative Sound Blaster Roar 2 is a lightweight speaker, weighing in at 3.6\npounds and not taking up more space than a normal forearm.\n\nWhat separates the Sound Blaster from the others on this list? The Roar 2 has\nan overdrive function to take the sound to the next level of dynamic\nperformance. That becomes especially attractive as a feature given the\nspeaker\u2019s 40-foot Bluetooth range. You\u2019ll be filling your home with all your\nfavorite sounds with this one.\n\nIt is NFC enabled and has a USB port. Should you decide to stack this for a\nfull on surround sound or stereo sound experience you can avail yourself of\nthe AUX inputs. Battery life for that power is a sparse 8 hours, however. It\u2019s\na discreet looking speaker with an extroverted sense of bravado. It retails\nfor $164.\n\n## 6. NAIM MU-SO\n\nThe Naim Mu-So falls on the higher end of the price spectrum. But if you are\nlooking for a premium indoor Bluetooth speaker, this is the one. It features\nBluetooth AptX, two USB optical inputs, 1 woofer, 1 midrange, and 1 tweeter.\nThe results are a robust range, dynamic performance, and crisp pure sound.\nThis is a muscular speaker.\n\n![Naim Mu-So Bluetooth](https://www.chipin.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/03/Naim-Mu-So-Bluetooth.jpg)\n\nThe Naim Mu-So Speaker comes with six 75 watt digital amplifiers\n\nThe cons against such a fabulous speaker are few. The sound loses some of its\npristine detail as you pump up the volume into the louder registers. And when\nso many less expensive indoor Bluetooth speakers currently saturate the market\nwith somewhat comparable performance, is such a purchase justified? At this\nprice, you are venturing into a genuine Hi-Fi territory. The Mu-So retails for\n$1100.\n\n**Outdoor Portable Bluetooth Speakers**\n\nThe landscape of portable Bluetooth speakers is much more densely populated.\nWe find a constellation of speakers equipped to do more than just stream your\nfavorite tunes. And separating the fluff from the muscle is sometimes a\ngargantuan task for consumers. Here a generation of speakers plunge into the\nsurf with you and resist all manner of weather challenges. A few of the top\nperformers fall below\u2026\n\n## 7. FUGOO STYLE\n\nThe Fugoo Style is a durable dynamic all-weather speaker that weighs in at\n11.6 ounces and measures 5.3 x 1.6 inches. Talk about a compact gem of a\nBluetooth speaker! This is one of the most affordable and equally strong\nperforming speakers out there this season.\n\n![fugoo style best bluetooth speaker](https://www.chipin.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/03/fugoo-style-best-bluetooth-speaker.jpg)\n\nThe Fugoo Style is a durable dynamic all-weather speaker that weighs in at\n11.6 ounces and measures 5.3 x 1.6 inches.\n\nWhere do you take this speaker? Anywhere you want. It\u2019s waterproof and boasts\n40 hours of strong battery life. So if you\u2019re wandering aimlessly nearly 2\ndays nonstop in the wilderness or floating in the middle of the Bermuda\nTriangle, never fret. You still have music to while your hours away. And top\nit all off with voice controlled functionality via Siri or Google Now. It\nretails for $140.\n\n## 8. UE ROLL 2\n\nThe UE Roll 2 is your swim coach. Take this orb like speaker into the pool\nwith you, never missing a beat from your favorite playlist. Its frequency\nrange is decent, scaling admirably through the midrange sounds with ease.\n\n![UE Roll 2 wireless pool speaker](https://www.chipin.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/03/UE-Roll2-wireless-pool-speaker.jpg)\n\nThe UE Roll 2 is the perfect companion for your next pool party.\n\nIt\u2019s got a few cons weighing against it: no voice commands, only 9 hours of\nbattery life, and no in speaker controls. Certainly, these might seem damning.\nBut if you are taking this into the pool or into the surf, chances are you\naren\u2019t so concerned. And for only $100, those elements can be quickly\noverlooked.\n\n## 9. BRAVEN XXL\n\nThe Braven XXL is a hefty yet luggable (pun fully intended) Bluetooth speaker.\nHere\u2019s a heavyweight in the line of portable Bluetooth speaker weight classes.\nWeighing in at a chunky 18 pounds and measuring 20.25 x 9.5 x 8.25 inches, the\nBraven recalls the days of massive boom boxes and tailgate parties.\n\n![Braven XXL bluetooth speaker](https://www.chipin.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/03/BravenXXL-bluetooth-speaker.jpg)\n\nThe Braven XXL is a hefty yet luggable (pun fully intended) Bluetooth speaker.\n\nWhere do you schlep this one? Probably to those BBQ picnics, tailgates and\noutdoor extravaganzas that require killer bass, dynamic frequency range, and\nfull-bodied sounds that have legs. This is definitively that speaker.\n\nBut while it is water resistant, it is not the sporty sort of speaker put\nforward by JBL or Naim. It retails for $250.\n\n## 10. JBL CLIP 2\n\nAnd speaking of JBL, the JBL Clip 2 clips the competition (another bad pun,\nfolks) with its light and remarkably portable design. This waterproof speaker\nis only 6.5 ounces, 5.5 x 3.7 x 1.7 inches and has 8 hours of battery life.\nFrom a distance, it looks like a miniature kettle bell one finds in a Crossfit\ngym, with its orb shape and handle.\n\n![JBL Clip 2 best bluetooth speaker](https://www.chipin.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/03/JBL_Clip2-best-bluetooth-speaker.jpg)\n\nThe JBL Clip 2 clips the competition with its light and remarkably portable\ndesign.\n\nBut in fact, it\u2019s one of the most affordable speakers on the market at only\n$60. Not remarkable on sound and no app to speak of. However, it\u2019s a very\nforgiving purchase to your wallet. Need an upgrade in the same family of\nspeakers, try the JBL Xtreme on for size.\n\nGo to top\n\nBest Bluetooth Speakers \u2013 Quick Questions and Answers\n\n1\\. What Is A Bluetooth Speaker?\n\nA Bluetooth speaker is a wireless speaker that uses its built-in amplifier to\nrelay sound. Devices like smartphones, tablets, computers and TVs transmit to\nthe speaker, (this is called pairing) and the speaker, in turn, streams the\naudio from the source.  \n\n2\\. How do I connect to my laptop, smartphone, or TV to my Bluetooth Speaker?\n\nTurn on your speaker. Then go into the settings of your device. You will\ntypically have a menu bar that lists wifi, Bluetooth, etc. Click on Bluetooth\nand click an option that says the search for devices. After a few moments,\nyour device should list your speaker. Click on the speaker option. You will be\npaired after a few moments.  \n\n3\\. What does NFC stand for on Bluetooth Speakers?\n\nNFC stands for Near-field communication and it means a portable device,\ntypically a smartphone, can be linked up to another device (like a Bluetooth\nspeaker) when brought within 4cm of proximity.  \n\n4\\. How can I connect, pair or stack multiple Bluetooth Speakers?\n\nMake sure all of your speakers are turned on. Following your steps for\nconnecting to a Bluetooth speaker, connect two devices.

Indoors or Outdoors\n\nFinding just the right mix of dynamic sound, durability, Bluetooth range, and\nperformance is what will ultimately land you the right indoor or outdoor\nspeaker. Taking into consideration price doesn\u2019t guarantee the best speaker on\nthe market, you\u2019ll be best served to ask yourself how you plan to use the\nspeaker. If it will be a part of the stationary furniture in the home or\noffice, then go the route of the indoor speakers, ignoring such things as\nwater and weather resistance. If you\u2019re planning that beach vacation and want\nto set your moment in the sun to music, look for a sturdy weather and water\nresistant speaker with some reasonable battery life.\n\nGo to top\n\n### Please share:\n\n  * [Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/best-bluetooth-speaker-review/?share=twitter \"Click to share on Twitter\")\n  * [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/best-bluetooth-speaker-review/?share=facebook \"Click to share on Facebook\")\n  * [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/best-bluetooth-speaker-review/?share=linkedin \"Click to share on LinkedIn\")\n  * [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/best-bluetooth-speaker-review/?share=telegram \"Click to share on Telegram\")\n  * [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/best-bluetooth-speaker-review/?share=jetpack-whatsapp \"Click to share on WhatsApp\")\n  * [Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/best-bluetooth-speaker-review/?share=reddit \"Click to share on Reddit\")\n  * More\n  * \n\n  * [Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/best-bluetooth-speaker-review/?share=email \"Click to email this to a friend\")\n  * [Click to print (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/best-bluetooth-speaker-review/#print \"Click to print\")\n  *   * [Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/best-bluetooth-speaker-review/?share=tumblr \"Click to share on Tumblr\")\n  * [Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/best-bluetooth-speaker-review/?share=pinterest \"Click to share on Pinterest\")\n  *   * [Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/best-bluetooth-speaker-review/?share=pocket \"Click to share on Pocket\")\n  * [Click to share on Skype (Opens in new window)](https://www.chipin.com/best-bluetooth-speaker-review/?share=skype \"Click to share on Skype\")\n  *   * \n\n[![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/84d1f1065e724b971d1b37e7b14153b1?s=75&d=mm&r=g)](https://www.chipin.com/author/kate/)\n\n### By [**Kyo**](https://www.chipin.com/author/kate/)\n\nView all articles by **[Kyo](https://www.chipin.com/author/kate/ \"Posts by\nKyo\")**\n\n#### Post navigation\n\n[__Crypto Exchanges Conquering the Market for Initial Coin\nOfferings](https://www.chipin.com/crypto-exchanges-conquering-the-market-for-\ninitial-coin-offerings/)\n\n[__TOAxMELT announce new inter-festival collaboration \u2013 TOA Berlin\n2019](https://www.chipin.com/toaxmelt-interfestival-collaboration-toa-\nberlin-2019/)\n\n  * What's hot\n  * Random Stuff\n\n### What\u2019s hot\n\n  * [ ![Best Preparation Tool to Explore Microsoft 70-740 Test](https://www.chipin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/microsoft-exam-preparation-300x200.jpg) ](https://www.chipin.com/exam-dumps-preparation-tool-microsoft-70-740-test/)\n\n[ Myth or Reality: Are Exam Dumps the Best Preparation Tool to Explore\nMicrosoft 70-740 Test?

In a series of articles, we try to cover Topics, that include:\n\n\tThe history behind cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and Ethereum\n\nThe process behind digital, public ledgers\n\nThe blockchain mining process\n\nProof-of-work and proof-of-stake systems\n\nAll of that sounds technical \u2013 trust us, we\u2019ve broken it down into layman\nterms that not only simple to understand but is also accurate technical-\nwise.\")\n\n  * [Cappasity](https://www.chipin.com/cappasity/ \"Cappasity, a company that specializes in 3D digitizing and its applications for augmented and virtual reality, is launching a global Ecosystem based on blockchain technology which will allow for the quick and inexpensive production of high-quality content. \")\n  * [Crowdfunding](https://www.chipin.com/crowdfunding/ \"In 2015, the crowdfunding industry was worth over $30 billion, up from a little over $5 billion in 2013. With increasing interest in the idea of public-supported projects and several crowdsourcing success stories making the news, the crowdfunding field looks to have an even bigger 2016.\n\nIn theory, it\u2019s a great idea: let public demand dictate which projects get\nfunded. It saves companies the trouble of making a product that no one really\nwants, and it also gives them money up front to pay for development,\nmanufacturing, and marketing. But it\u2019s also been a great idea in practice, as\ncompanies like Pebble, Bragi, Misfit, and others have benefitted from the\nmoney raised during their crowdfunding campaign and released highly regarded\nproducts to the general public.\n\nSome naysayers might balk and the idea of crowdfunded items, insisting that\nthey\u2019re little more than well-crafted marketing campaigns with no substance\nbehind them. Others may say that the public doesn\u2019t know what it wants until\nthey\u2019re presented with a finished product. While these arguments have been\ntrue for a small number of campaigns, we think crowdfunding works. It\u2019s been\nproven over and over again that great products can come out of crowdfunding\ncampaigns, and we think it\u2019s safe to say that crowdfunding is here to stay. \")\n\n  * [Crowdsourcing](https://www.chipin.com/crowdsourcing/ \"Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining ideas, funds, time, expertise etc. from a group of people or a \u2018crowd\u2019 in a bid to accomplish a premeditated goal.\")\n  * [Fintech](https://www.chipin.com/fintech/ \"Checking out and reviewing the most innovative Fintech Start-ups in Europe, especially London and Berlin. What are the trends and which ones can you trust?\")\n  * [Fitness](https://www.chipin.com/fitness/ \"With the immense popularity of fitness trackers in recent years and the perpetual need of the general public to shape up, slim down, and get fit, there have been a significant number of products in the fitness and sports category looking for crowdfunding support. And while the fitness tracking craze may have already reached its peak, that pesky fact hasn\u2019t done much to slow down the chain of fitness and sports products looking for support on sites like Indiegogo and Kickstarter. In fact, market saturation may be driving more and more innovation, as products promise to do more, cost less, and look better than their predecessors.\n\nIn fact, some popular fitness and sports products on the market today exist as\na result of their successful crowdfunding campaigns. The Misfit Shine got its\nstart on Indiegogo, as did the Atlas Wristband, and both of these devices\nrepresented an innovative breakthrough in materials engineering and movement\nrecognition, respectively. And the hugely successful Bragi Dash raised over $3\nmillion on Kickstarter several years back. Maybe the market for fitness and\nsports devices is crowded, but the some of these past products prove that if\nconsumers see a product that\u2019s innovative, creative, and useful, they\u2019ll back\nit.\")\n\n  * [General](https://www.chipin.com/general/ \"Selection of interesting topics and articles which don't fit into the other categories.\")\n  * [Health](https://www.chipin.com/health/ \"The motivation to improve the quality of life for humans all over the world is one of the biggest drivers of health innovation. It\u2019s pushed us to develop life-saving medical technologies, devices, and surgeries, all of which have saved many, many lives. The other big driver of health innovation, of course, is money. Without funding for research, product development, and testing, many transformative ideas simply can\u2019t come to fruition.\n\nIn the past, this money has come from several sources: the pharmaceutical\nindustry, the government, and foundations with healthcare as part of their\nmissions, primarily. While the general public has always been solicited for\ndonations and for help with fundraisers, crowdfunding can now take that\nsolicitation to the next level and directly involve the public in the\ndevelopment of these new technologies.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in the healthcare field, crowdfunding isn\u2019t just for these big\nentities \u2014 it\u2019s available to anyone. Now, raising money to cover expensive\ntreatments that insurance won\u2019t fully cover can be done on a wide scale;\nanyone can create a crowdfunding page and ask for help. In a country such as\nthe United States, where healthcare is not a guarantee \\(and is a touchy\nsubject all around\\), this has been a  lifesaver for many. Crowdfunding is not\nonly helping to improve medical technology, but it\u2019s helping individuals pay\nfor care.\")\n\n  * [ICO](https://www.chipin.com/ico/ \"Looking to invest in Initial Coin Offerings \\(ICO\\) but don\u2019t know where to start? ICOs have boomed in popularity ever since the Ethereum craze at the start of 2017.\n\nPreviously, startups could only hope to raise money through complicated seed\nrounds, uncertain VC-funding, or even go bootstrap if they fail to secure\ninvestments.\n\nWith ICOs, startups not only get to raise money through crowdfunding, they\nalso allow normal people who don\u2019t have the financial capacities of a\ntraditional investor to invest in projects they like.\n\nWhile ICOs have disrupted the startup funding scene \\(as well as the fintech\nworld\\), it is still in its infancy with lots of room for errors and\nuncertainties.\n\nBecause of this, Chipin strives to provide our readers with the latest updates\nand news in the ICO scene, upcoming ICOs, intimate interviews with notable\npersonalities in the scene as well as coverage on exclusive cryptocurrency-\nrelated events.\")\n\n  * [Internet of Things](https://www.chipin.com/internet-of-things/ \"The Internet of Things, commonly referred to as IoT, are poised to change our lives at a very foundational level. \n\nThis emerging field is helping us move from total human involvement to near-\ntotal automation, as our devices, appliances, and data platforms become\ncapable of interacting with one another. While this may seem like cause for\nconcern at first \u2014 what role do people play? \u2014 the IoT can actually create a\nlot more convenience and safety for everyone.\n\nWith over 800 companies around the world working on IoT components, and\ninevitably with more on the way, the ground for crowdfunded IoT projects is\nquite fertile.\n\nSo far, lots of IoT projects have been funded on sites like Kickstarter and\nIndiegogo, including smart home components, platforms and interfaces, toys and\ngadgets, and trackers of all shapes and sizes. With the growing acceptance of\nand demand for IoT devices, there\u2019s plenty of room for more projects.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that IoT is a relatively young field, with the\naverage age of each category hovering around five years. This will be a fun\none to watch, as innovative new products, new automation, and new uses are\nbeing developed on a regular basis.\")\n\n  * [Lifestyle](https://www.chipin.com/life/ \"Selection of Articles about Life, Meditation, Mindfulness, Motivation, Happiness, and Health.

Plus, sometimes products are funded and never actually get made. There are a lot of details to keep track of, and this information isn\u2019t always aggregated in an easy to find spot. Well, until now, that is.\n\nHere at ChipIn, we aim to keep you caught up on the latest developments in the\ncrowdfunding world.

ChipIn has helped run over thousand crowdfunding campaigns.\")\n  * [Reviews](https://www.chipin.com/reviews/ \"Crowdfunding narratives, when done right, are incredibly alluring. They\u2019re the result of clever marketing, slick editing, and compelling storytelling. The pictures are beautiful, the prototypes are sleek, and the prices are only going to go up after the campaign has ended. It\u2019s tempting to throw your money at every attractive crowdfunding project you come across, but which ones are really worth it?\n\nThat\u2019s where the reviews here on ChipIn come in. We\u2019ll take a long, hard look\nat the popular, the creative, the innovative, the bizarre, and the curious\ncampaigns to help you decide which ones to back. We\u2019ll compare them to what\u2019s\nalready out there and show you how they size up. And, when the prototypes\nbecome shipments and find their way into the hands of supporters, we\u2019ll let\nyou know how these products fare against the competition.\n\nThe bottom line is that you need to be well informed when you\u2019re looking to\nback a crowdfunded product or service. Failures are not entirely uncommon, and\nthere\u2019s little or no recourse that backers can take if a product fails to ship\nor a company goes under.

ChipIn takes a closer look at the issues we will face.\")\n  * [Smart Home](https://www.chipin.com/smart-home/ \"No longer a futuristic detail out of bad sci-fi movies or the theme of childish Tex Avery cartoons, the smart home is a real home for many people all over the world. Sure, it\u2019s taken a while for our reality to catch up with the visionaries of 50 years ago, but the seamless automation has, we think, made the wait worthwhile. It\u2019s equally as wonderful in theory as in practice, making the lives of smart homeowners more convenient and also safer. \n\nThese days, smart home components make up a substantial percentage of the\ncrowdfunding projects that are up for support. This is probably a result of\nmore and more people becoming interested in home automation and recognizing\nthat it truly is an affordable and user-friendly possibility. In fact, popular\nproducts like Canary, LIFX LED light bulbs, and SmartThings switches all\nstarted out as projects on crowdfunding sites.\n\nAs developers figure out more ways for appliances and devices to interact with\none another, and as consumers become more comfortable with the idea of home\nautomation, we look for this category to grow in the coming years. It\u2019s clear\nthat the smart home sells and consumers are coming around to buying.\")\n\n  * [SmartWatch](https://www.chipin.com/smartwatch/ \"A few years ago, the thing to have on your wrist was a fitness tracker. Now, it looks like smartwatches are the next \u201cit\u201d wearable. Even though they\u2019ve been around for a few years, last year\u2019s highly anticipated release of the Apple Watch made it more mainstream, and now more and more manufacturers are coming out with their own riff on the theme.\n\nWhen done right, a good smartwatch will replace several devices, including and\nespecially your smartphone. Not that carrying around a smartphone is\ndifficult, but wearing it on your wrist? Now that\u2019s convenient.\n\nSmartwatches and crowdfunding, then, are a perfect match: an in-demand product\nmakes a compelling project. In fact, one of the biggest crowdfunding success\nstories of all time is the Pebble Time at over $20 million. A few years prior,\nthe original Pebble pulled in $10 million on Kickstarter. However, while the\nprecedent may seem clear, there is a big cautionary tale in the crowdfunded\nsmartwatch category, and that\u2019s the Kreyos Meteor. This project closed at $1.5\nmillion in the summer of 2013, and hopes were high. However, one failure after\nanother hit, and the entire company shut down a little over a year later.\nThankfully, the Kreyos story is the exception here, as other crowdfunded\nsmartwatches have done remarkably well. \")\n\n  * [Universa](https://www.chipin.com/universa/ \"Universa is introducing a revolutionary blockchain technology.\n\nUniversa is designed to improve on Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s technologies by\nimproving on their weaknesses as well as pushing for adoption by businesses in\naddition to improving smart contracts and the tokenization process.\n\nAside from making smart contracts work even quicker \\(and smarter\\) in\nUniversa, the platform wants to get rid of mining which wastes a lot of energy\nto process transactions.\n\nLike Ethereum, the Universa platform also works similarly in a sense that\nother cryptocurrencies can be built on the Universa blockchain without any\nproblems.\")\n\n  * [Virtual Reality](https://www.chipin.com/virtual-reality/ \"After a false start in the \u201890s, the future of virtual reality is exceptionally bright. Thanks to several successful crowdfunding campaigns, lots of people will get an early chance to wear a pair of brand new VR shades. Big names in the field such as Oculus Rift and Avegant Glyph pulled in well over a million dollars each on Kickstarter, demonstrating that the demand is there and the general public is excited about this new technology.\n\nWhile augmented reality products have so far met with less success than their\nVR counterparts, it\u2019s only a matter of time before some big AR campaigns start\nsmashing their goals. While the term \u201cvirtual reality\u201d may be a common one,\nthe public is only starting to become familiar with AR \\(Pokemon Go\\) and its\nvast potential.\n\nAs for what can be done with these products, we\u2019re only starting to understand\nthe potential for this technology. VR is already known as a gamer\u2019s paradise,\nbut opportunities for high stakes training in fields like medicine and the\nmilitary abound. AR is already being used as a gaming platform and a travel\naid, but uses in marketing, design, and even personal safety are also becoming\nmore popular. Needless to say, we\u2019re excited about the future, whether it\u2019s\nreal, virtual, or augmented.\")\n\n  * [Wearables](https://www.chipin.com/wearables/ \"The wearables category is an enormous one, mostly because there are a lot of smart devices that a person can wear somewhere on his or her body. You\u2019ve got the obvious wearables, like fitness trackers and smartwatches. Then, there are smart helmets, smart headbands that measure all sorts of things, all sorts of virtual reality headsets, smart clothing, and much, much more.\n\nThere\u2019s a substantial and longstanding tradition of wearables as successful\ncrowdfunding products. From the original Pebble, to later Pebble iterations,\nto the Muse brain sensing headband, to the Bragi Dash smart earbuds, there are\ndozens of popular products that got their start thanks to a Kickstarter or\nIndiegogo campaign.\n\nWhat\u2019s the explanation as to why wearables have done so well in crowdfunding?\nWell, for starters, the technology has come a long way; accelerometers,\ngyroscopes, and other sensors have now made it possible to sense, track, and\ndetect all sorts of activity. Plus, the prevalence of smartphones and the\n\u201cthere\u2019s an app for that\u201d mentality means that data can be aggregated in a\ncommon place. Finally, it\u2019s probably safe to say that people are more\ncomfortable with the idea of wearing technology instead 24/7. It all adds up\nto lots of wearables, and lots of crowdfunding campaigns.\")\n\n### Social Media\n\n  * [FACEBOOK](https://www.facebook.com/chipincom/)\n  * [TWITTER](https://www.twitter.com/chipin)\n  * [PINTEREST](https://www.pinterest.com/chipin_com/)\n\n### ChipIn\n\n  * [About](https://www.chipin.com/about/)\n  * [Editorial Promise](https://www.chipin.com/editorial-promise/)\n  * [Team](https://www.chipin.com/team/)\n  * [Advertising](https://www.chipin.com/advertising/)\n  * [Contact](https://www.chipin.com/contact/)\n\n### Find us on Facebook\n\n![As Seen In](https://www.chipin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/chipin-as-\nseen-in.jpg) \u00a9 [ChipIn](https://www.chipin.com/) 2018 All Rights Reserved |\n[Privacy Policy & Terms](/terms/)\n\nBack to top\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/chipincom/\n\"Facebook\")[__](https://www.twitter.com/chipin\n\"Twitter\")[__](https://www.chipin.com/feed/ \"RSS\nFeed\")[__](https://www.pinterest.com/chipin_com/ \"Pinterest\")\n\n  * [Crowdfunding](https://www.chipin.com/crowdfunding/)\n  * [Smart Home](https://www.chipin.com/smart-home/)\n  * [Reviews](https://www.chipin.com/reviews/)\n  * [Internet of Things](https://www.chipin.com/internet-of-things/)\n  * Other Categories __\n    * [Fintech](https://www.chipin.com/fintech/)\n    * [News](https://www.chipin.com/news/)\n    * [Wearables](https://www.chipin.com/wearables/)\n    * [Fitness](https://www.chipin.com/fitness/)\n    * [Health](https://www.chipin.com/health/)\n    * [Lifestyle](https://www.chipin.com/life/)\n    * [SmartWatch](https://www.chipin.com/smartwatch/)\n    * [Augmented Reality](https://www.chipin.com/augmented-reality/)\n    * [Virtual Reality](https://www.chipin.com/virtual-reality/)\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\n### Search the site\n\n__\n\n\u00d7\n\nThis site uses cookies.
