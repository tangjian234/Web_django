Bluetooth is a wonderfully easy and versatile way to stream music, and\nafter years of honing and improvement, the best Bluetooth speakers can sound\nexcellent \u2013 especially when they also utilise sound quality improving\ntechnologies such as aptX, aptX HD, AAC and/or Wi-Fi, so you can stream from\nyour device or the cloud, in higher resolution.\n\n  * Even higher fidelity, in more rooms?

This is going to become more of an issue\nas wireless speaker technology evolves.\n\nA lot of the best recent 'Bluetooth' speakers also feature Wi-Fi streaming\nfrom your phone or direct from the cloud for services such as Tidal, Spotify\nand Apple Music. Others include Alexa voice control, which can let you summon\nmusic from Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer and others. You need to be subscribed\nto these services, of course. A great example of this is the Audio Pro C3 that\nis #1 in this very list.\n\nBluetooth also turns up as an option on speakers that are really meant to be\nused with Wi-Fi or an analogue or digital, wired input \u2013 Bowers & Wilkins'\nZeppelin, Naim's Mu-so family and so on.\n\nHowever, since far more people search for 'Bluetooth speaker' than 'wireless\nspeaker' we're going to continue to call it that.\n\n## The best Bluetooth speakers to buy\n\n![Best Bluetooth speaker: Kanto TUK](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-\nimage.svg)![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Kanto)\n\n### 1\\.

Most\nhigher-end wireless speakers also include Wi-Fi and cloud connectivity to\nservice Tidal, Spotify, AirPlay, Chromecast et al. Kanto TUK has no truck with\nsuch new-fangled notions. It supports Bluetooth 4.2 \u2013 AAC and AptX \u2013 and NO\nOTHER WIRELESS CONNECTIONS AT ALL!\n\nIt's also not a speaker. It's a stereo pair of attractive, compact bookshelf\n_speakers_. The right hand one contains the connections and DACs and Class D\namplifiers and all that, and the right one is a slave, connected by a wire.\nYes, doing 'proper' stereo Bluetooth without a wire between the speakers is a\nmore elegant solution \u2013 but in my experience it never works satisfactorily\n100% of the time.\n\nIt's also not just a pair of speakers, either. With a pre-amped input for a\nturntable, a standard, line level phono input, optical digital and USB, the\nKanto TUK is actually what old people would call a 'music system' or 'mini\nsystem'.\n\nI've been using this for some months now via Bluetooth and from a DAC attached\nto my iMac and after a certain amount of running in, it sounds superb \u2013 as it\nshould for this price. Given that a stereo pair of speakers _always_ sounds\nbetter than a one-box speaker of equivalent price, this is THE choice for\nthose who want a music setup based around Bluetooth, with the best possible\nsound quality. Clearly, setup is more complicated than with a one-box but the\ncompact size of the TUK and straightforward connectivity, make it as easy as\nit can be.\n\nI've seen reviews of this saying the bass is a bit thin, but I can assure you\non a half decent pair of stands or a reasonably substantial shelf it is\n_booming._ There's a subwoofer connection as well, if you are a total bottom\nend fiend. A handsome and sturdy remote is included, although I can't say I've\nused it much. Your colour choices are the black pictured here, and its arch\nrival: white. The white finish looks better IMO and the casing doesn't seem to\nbe the dirt magnet that many white speakers are.\n\n![Best Bluetooth speaker: Sonos\nMove](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Sonos)\n\n### 2\\.

But really, it is a Sonos multi-room speaker, designed to\nbe connected via Wi-Fi. However the Move has been ruggedised, and had a\nbattery and Bluetooth connectivity added, so you can use it outdoors.\n\nBasically a Sonos One that you can take in your garden, the Move also includes\nAmazon Alexa or Google voice assistants (although not when in Bluetooth mode)\nand multi-room streaming support from a vast range of music services (although\nnot when in Bluetooth mode).\n\nSound quality is excellent, and there's some genuinely clever software that\nautomatically optimises the sound to its surroundings every time you move it.\nYou can have some fun with the Move putting it in the most acoustically\nunpromising positions you can think of \u2013 it nearly always ends up sounding\ngood, indoors or out.\n\nSonos Move is not the most handsome thing, but you soon realise it's design is\nexcellent. A massive, recessed 'handle' on the back makes it easy to\ntransport, and as well as being rugged, the base and paint finish are\ncunningly designed so it doesn't get marked and scarred by a life of being\nhefted about and placed on patios.\n\nSonos' app provides support for any music service you can think of or\nsubscribe to, as well as allowing voice control of tunes via Alexa or Google.\nWhen you're in Bluetooth mode however, Move functions like any other Bluetooth\nspeaker \u2013 you send music from your phone or other devices, from whatever music\napps you happen to have installed.\n\nAudio quality takes a noticeable hit when you switch to Bluetooth, compared to\nWi-Fi or cloud streaming. Even so, it sounds way better than any other\nportable Bluetooth speaker I can think of. The battery life of 10 hours isn't\nbad, but do remember to replace the Move on its elegant charging stand when\nyou're not using it outdoors or in the bathroom \u2013 the battery continues to\ndrain even in standby mode, which can be an annoyance.\n\n![Best Bluetooth speaker: Ultimate Ears Megaboom\n3](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 3\\.

It's fully focussed on the outdoors, being\nwaterproof and very rugged. Actually it's not just waterproof \u2013 it even\nfloats, so if it's accidentally (or deliberately) dropped in the pool, it's\neasily retrieved.\n\nUnlike the Addon C3, the Megaboom 3 probably won't win approving nods from\naudiophiles but while it may be targeted at those who want dance, pop and rock\ntunes in the outdoors, its small footprint and attractive design mean it can\nfunction perfectly happily in the kitchen. The cooly muted colours it comes in\nare, in fact, about the only quiet things about it.\n\nUltimate Ears has absolutely piled on the bonus features here, with the\nability to pair two in stereo as well as the option to chain anything up to\n'hundreds' of them (!) for even greater volume.\n\nA 'magic button' on top lets you easily play, pause and skip tracks and, uh,\nnot-so-easily control playlists. It's cool that UE has added this\nfunctionality but it has two problems: it only works with Apple Music and\nDeezer playlists, and you can only skip forwards through your playlists, one\nat a time. So if you have hundreds of playlists, this could be of rather\nlimited use (or at least, you'll get RSI skipping to the one you want).\n\nWith 20 hours of battery life, impressive bass and volume, 360\u00ba sound, and\nbuild quality that renders it essentially unkillable, the UE Megaboom is by\nfar the best outdoor speaker you can get. And as noted, you don't need to wait\nfor summer to come back to enjoy it, as it does work well (for pop music in\nparticular) in the kitchen, bedroom or elsewhere.\n\n\u2022 If you want a very similar speaker with Alexa built in, as on an Amazon Echo\ndevice, **UE also does the Megablast** **.** This doesn't float but it it\nwaterproof and does let you control Amazon and Spotify playlists and choons\nwith the power of your voice (and Alexa).\n\n![Best Bluetooth speaker: Bluesound Pulse Flex\n2i](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 4\\.

With Wi-fi and\nethernet included, it's actually like a more portable Sonos. It's Airplay 2\ncompatible, and also works with popular streaming services including Tidal and\nSpotify, and internet radio.\n\nConsidering how small it is, sound quality is little short of remarkable. With\na wired connection it's even capable of playing hi-res audio files, for\naudiophiles, but Tidal (CD quality) and even the likes of Spotify (compressed\nMP3) sound wonderful.\n\nThe versatility needn't stop there, as you can add a battery pack (\u00a369) and\ncarry it with you wherever you may roam. Although not for very long, as\nbattery life is only 6 hours.\n\nCompared to the Audio Pro speaker at #2, Bluesound's champ is bordering on\nugly, but since it sounds even better than the C3, has even more connectivity,\nand boasts an app that actually works, we'll set aside our aesthetic\nreservations.\n\n![Best Bluetooth speaker: Audio Pro Addon\nC3](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 5\\.

Android app still works fine (and older versions of iOS, if\nyou're a tardy updater).**\n\nThere are Bluetooth speakers that are more like updates to the old hi-fi mini\nsystems \u2013 you plug them in, they're mainly for streaming but have a line in,\nand the emphasis is on superior sound quality. Then there are your classic\nportable Bluetooth speakers with battery power and go-anywhere convenience.\nThe Audio Pro Addon C3 however \u2013 and a number of the other Bluetooth speakers\nlisted here \u2013 are a hybrid of the two.\n\nThe C3 looks extremely stylish, sounds superb but is very petite, has a natty\ncarry handle, and nine hours of battery life. It also piles on AirPlay and\nSpotify Connect via Wi-Fi, as well as Audio Pro's own app, so you can even use\nit as part of a very chic multi-room setup. There's a line in as well.\n\nAudio Pro's app is dire, but you don't actually need to use it other than for\nmulti-room control. If you use AirPlay from a laptop or mobile you can bypass\nit entirely and still have multi-room. Although one thing you should\ndefinitely use the app for is to set up the 5 preset buttons on the front of\nthe C3 \u2013 these then give instant access to your favourite web radio stations\nor Spotify playlists.\n\nSlightly surprisingly when connected via Bluetooth there's no support for the\naudio-improving Apt-X (Android) or AAC (iOS) codecs. However music played via\nBluetooth still sounds excellent. This isn't a cheap box for playing pop music\nin the park \u2013 although it will do that, so long as you keep it dry \u2013 it's a\nvery musical, high quality speaker that happens to use Bluetooth.\n\nWhat you've got here is a super-portable speaker with Wi-Fi streaming for\nhigher quality and multi-room, with Bluetooth for total convenience. It's a\nstunner, especially if you can avoid using Audio Pro's quite crappy app.\n\n![Best Bluetooth speaker: Bose Soundlink\nRevolve](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 6\\.

But it\nstill rocks, and this Mk 2 model is notably better than the (excellent) first\nKilburn in terms of both sound and looks.\n\nAudio is loud and proud, rich and powerful with plenty of bass, and cleverly\nprocessed with a strong 'faux-analogue' sound. Built as a compact speaker for\nsmall to medium rooms, it is nonetheless still battery-powered, and portable\nvia a natty strap.\n\nPairing is swift and the audio, while coloured so as to sound 'rocky', can be\ntweaked all over the place using the old-skool bass and treble tone knobs.\n\nThe looks might still not be to non-rockers' tastes, but Marshall has toned\ndown the 'heavy metal' styling in recent years, and this sits quite happily in\nany home that isn't overloaded with chintz.\n\nThe audio is still not what you'd call subtle, but there's little to beat the\nMarshall Kilburn for sheer room-filling oomph. The addition of basic splash-\nand moisture-resistance makes it suitable for bathroom use, so long as you\ndon't leave it too near the bath.\n\nIt's part of a range of excellent Marshall Bluetooth speakers and [also,\nnowadays, some excellent multi-room Wi-Fi\nspeakers.](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8269714/type/dlg/sid/t3-us-7197707572546836000/https://www.marshallheadphones.com/mh_uk_en/speakers/multi-\nroom)\n\n![Best Bluetooth speaker: Marshall Stanmore 2\nVoice](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n  \n\n### 8\\.

The Stanmore II Voice takes the\nmusical virtues of the KIlburn II but loses battery power and a bit of\nmoisture proofing.\n\nInstead what you get is a very stylish, plug-in speaker with 80 combined Watts\nof power (2x 15W plus a 50W woofer) and Alexa built in. It is a little bit of\na faff setting it up, and once that's done you have to press a button every\ntime you want to pair it, or it defaults to a Wi-Fi setting that as far as I\ncan see, is only needed for the aforementioned setup.\n\nHowever, maybe you don't _need_ to pair it.\n\nThat's because Alexa, used in conjunction with Amazon Music or Spotify (with\nother services to follow now Amazon has opened up Alexa to third parties),\nmakes for a great audio experience on the Stanmore II. Nobody is going to\nmistake it for audiophile sound, but being able to order up any tune in the\nworld, and have it blasted out, is highly enjoyable. Eventually, Marshall\nreckons Amazon will also allow third-party speakers to use its multi-room\nsystem, but we'll see about that.\n\nEven if you don't have Amazon Music or Spotify, Alexa's usual bag of tricks\nand Skills is on hand, and it's excellent as an apt-X Bluetooth speaker, too.\n\nIf you _only_ want to use it as a Bluetooth speaker, you're better off with\nthe vanilla, Alexa-less version of the [Stanmore\nII.](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8434&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FMarshall-\nMRL1001902-Stanmore-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker%2Fdp%2FB07HMTHH9C%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fs%3Delectronics%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1545645753%26sr%3D1-2%26keywords%3Dstanmore%2Bii%26tag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-21%26ascsubtag%3Dt3-us-8634460528900805000-21).\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 9\\.

But that's fine. In my opinion, the\nmore upfront sound of the Cambridge Audio YoYo (M) is better \u2013 and it's\ncheaper too \u2013 but I know loads of older folks and acoustic heads love the\nRuark sound.\n\nThe fact the speakers are wired to each other does make setup less of a\nhassle, as it removes the need to turn on two speakers every time you want to\nlisten to music. It does limit how far apart you can place them, but you could\nalways buy a longer 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable.\n\n **\u2022 Hey, why not add a turntable while you're at it?**\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\nRather brilliantly, you can mate the MR1 Mk II with a [Rega\nP1](https://www.audiot.co.uk/products/rega-planar-1-plus-12279.aspx) or\nupgrade to a [Rega P2](https://www.audiot.co.uk/products/rega-\nplanar-2-turntable-9915.aspx). As you can see, they make an exceedingly\nhandsome couple \u2013 and let me tell you, readers, they're a couple who make\nsweet music together. Mmm-mm.\n\nIf you don't require stereo, or lack the space for two speakers, but love the\nsophisticated, 1950s-esque look and sound of Ruark, you should seriously\nconsider the **Ruark R1 Mk III**. With a built-in DAB radio, it might be all\nthe speaker your kitchen or caravan ever needs\u2026\n\n## Best portable speakers with Bluetooth\n\nThe best portable speakers turn up everywhere from fields to beaches to\nkitchens, or even strapped to cyclists as they pedal past blasting out Taylor\nSwift or M\u00f6t\u00f6rhead. They're like the portable radios of the 21st century, and\nthe best portable speakers are waterproof or at least water resistant. Right\nnow, they are dead handy if you're working from home \u2013 specifically, from your\ngarden or balcony. Or, if you have no garden, they could be useful for those\nworking in the bathroom as it's the only unused space.\n\nWith a battery and vary degrees of ruggedising and waterproofing, these are\nhandy for moving from room to room, and also taking outside. Some are fully\nwaterproof and can be chucked in your swimming pool or, perhaps more\nrealistically for UK readers, stand up to sudden summer downpours.\n\n## How to buy the best battery-powered, portable, waterproof speaker\n\nPortable speakers use Bluetooth to receive music from just about any phone,\ntablet or laptop in existence, and although the audio may not be lossless, the\nbest ones do deliver decent sonics, as well as portability, versatility and\ntoughness.\n\nIdeally, you want aptX (usually found on Android device) and/or AAC (usually\non iOS and Macs although it is starting to appear on certain Android phones\ntoo) support for better audio \u2013 these suck more bytes of information out of\nyour music playing device, giving theoretically better sound, especially with\nhigher bitrate music streams and MP3.\n\nThat said, portable speakers for outdoors in particular are generally more\nabout volume than refinement, and any kind of Bluetooth delivers perfectly\nadequate audio for that. They just need to be loud enough to be heard over\n[the sizzling of your barbecue](https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-barbecue),\nor the drone of your [electric lawnmower](https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-\ncordless-lawn-mower).\n\n **Please note these speakers are not all fully waterproof.** There aren't\nsufficient waterproof speakers of good enough quality to make a list\nworthwhile. We've noted which ones you can submerge in water, and which ones\nwill just stand up to a bit of summer showering. Although all these sound very\ngood, most aren't of a suitable quality for 'serious' listening.\n\n## The best portable speakers, in order\n\n![Best portable speaker: Ultimate Ears Wonderboom\n2](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Ultimate Ears)\n\n### 1\\.

Better sound, longer battery\nlife (13 hours instead of 10), cool new buttons to play with, dust- and sand-\nproofing (as well as the previous imperviousness to water), and still all for\njust \u00a389.99. And Ultimate Ears products never retail at their RRP for long, so\ngive it a month or so and it'll be even more of a bargain.\n\nUnlike UE's more sophisticated Megaboom 3, there's no app to use more than one\nof them at once; it's just a straight-up Bluetooth speaker. It's super-\nportable though, and you can pair two of them either in stereo or dual mono.\nStrong Bluetooth means they can be placed 100m apart too \u2013 'at either end of a\ntennis court', was one example given at launch. Even with just one Wonderboom\n2 in play, the 360 degree audio is better than it has any right to be at the\nprice, especially with pop, hip-hop, EDM, bro rock and other outdoor party-\nfriendly sounds.\n\nThe Wonderboom 2 doesn't really try to straddle home and outdoors: it's\nclearly meant to be taken to wherever the party is. It's fully waterproof \u2013 in\nfact not only does it also float, but if you push it under the water for\nwhatever reason, it'll even survive that. Being IP57 rated, it's also well\nprotected against grit, salt water, dust and beach-side sand, so long as you\nkeep the USB charger cover in place. It's sufficiently rugged that you can\nchuck it at the wall if you like, and it'll survive that too.\n\nAnother interesting new feature is Outdoor Boost. This makes the sound a bit\nless bassy and more shrill. This doesn't sound better than the normal mode,\nclearly, but it 'cuts through' better and could be a handy addition. In an\nemergency, you can also still charge your phone from the Wonderboom 2.\n\nThe Wonderboom 2 is the state of the art in waterproof, outdoor portable\nspeakers. Keep an eye out for the original Wonderboom speaker going cheap,\nthough \u2013 it's still an excellent product.\n\nToday's best prices on the original Wonderboom\n\n[215 Amazon customer\nreviews](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Freviews%2FB06XXMFMG8%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26ascsubtag%3Dt3-us-9994249767373474000-20)\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nUE WONDERBOOM Super Portable...\n\nAmazon\n\nPrime\n\n[$49.99](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8434&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0787M88MY%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dt3-us-1205706301398678500-20)\n\n[View](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8434&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0787M88MY%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dt3-us-1205706301398678500-20)\n\nReduced Price\n\nUE Wonderboom\n\nWalmart\n\n[$315.75](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=789549608&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F789549608&subId1=t3-us-3543497440680983600)\n\n[$58.45](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=789549608&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F789549608&subId1=t3-us-2478101913313031000)\n\n[View](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=789549608&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F789549608&subId1=t3-us-3978969958777408500)\n\nUltimate Ears - WONDERBOOM...\n\nBest Buy\n\n[$99.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/221109/633495/10014?prodsku=5750405&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F5750405%2Fpdp&intsrc=CATF_4831&subId1=t3-us-3842819141688440000)\n\n[View](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/221109/633495/10014?prodsku=5750405&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F5750405%2Fpdp&intsrc=CATF_4831&subId1=t3-us-2672131055346820600)\n\nShow More Deals\n\nWe check over 130 million products every day for the best prices\n\n![Best portable waterproof speaker: Ultimate Ears Megaboom\n3](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 2\\.

The cooly\nmuted colours it comes in are, in fact, about the only quiet things about it.\n\nIn contrast to the simplicity of the Wonderboom 2, Ultimate Ears has trowelled\non the bonus features here, with the ability to pair two in stereo as well as\nthe option to chain anything up to 'hundreds' of them (!) for even greater\nvolume, via an app.\n\nA 'magic button' on top lets you easily play, pause and skip tracks and, uh,\nnot-so-easily control playlists. It's cool that UE has added this\nfunctionality but it has two problems: it only works with Apple Music and\nDeezer playlists, and you can only skip forwards through your playlists, one\nat a time. So if you have hundreds of playlists, this could be of rather\nlimited use (or at least, you'll get RSI skipping to the one you want).\n\nWith 20 hours of battery life, impressive bass and volume, 360\u00ba sound, and\nbuild quality that renders it essentially unkillable, the UE Megaboom is by\nfar the best outdoor speaker you can get. And as noted, you don't need to wait\nfor summer to come back to enjoy it, as it does work well (for pop music in\nparticular) in the kitchen, bedroom or elsewhere.\n\nTo put it simply, Wonderboom 2 is the best portable speaker, but Megaboom 3 is\na better speaker overall. But seeing as this is a list of the best portable\nspeakers, we have ranked the simpler, smaller Wonderboom 2 top. Hopefully that\nmakes sense.\n\n\u2022 If you want a very similar speaker with Alexa built in, as on an Amazon Echo\ndevice, **UE also does the Megablast** **.** This doesn't float but it is\nwaterproof and does let you control Amazon and Spotify playlists and choons\nwith the power of your voice (and Alexa).\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 3\\.

It's also pretty affordable for a Bang & Olufsen\nproduct.\n\nNeedless to say, it will not be of use as part of a grime sound system, but\nthere's enough bass to underpin the sweet mids and treble, giving a very\ndecent overall sound. For the size, which is smaller than many phones, it's\npretty remarkable.\n\nThere's no full-on waterproofing, so be careful, but the P2 is at least\n'splash and dust resistant'.\n\nYou'll probably want to use your phone to skip tracks and change volume\nbecause the P2's touch controls are, to put it mildly, hit and miss. I'd also\nadvise giving the Beoplay app a miss, other than for initial setup, and just\nusing it as a straightforward Bluetooth speaker.\n\nFinally, the P2 also makes a very solid speakerphone, for when the music must\ncease, and it's time for business.\n\n##### Bang & Olufsen Beoplay A1\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\nIf you want essentially the same speaker, but with more bass and volume, the\nlarger, circular Beoplay A1 is also well worth considering.\n\nToday's best B&O Beoplay A1 prices\n\n[369 Amazon customer\nreviews](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Freviews%2FB01KIV5WE4%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26ascsubtag%3Dt3-us-4006266374870308000-20)\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nB&O Play Beoplay A1 Portable...\n\nAmazon\n\n[$139.99](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8434&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07BV1TR1M%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dt3-us-9657531899545582000-20)\n\n[View](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8434&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07BV1TR1M%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dt3-us-9657531899545582000-20)\n\nBang & Olufsen Beoplay A1...\n\nBHPhoto\n\n[$250](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1351014-REG/b_o_play_by_bang_olufsen_1297880_a1_portable_bluetooth_speaker.html/BI/20811/KBID/16572?SID=t3-us-1071224329856737200)\n\n[View](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1351014-REG/b_o_play_by_bang_olufsen_1297880_a1_portable_bluetooth_speaker.html/BI/20811/KBID/16572?SID=t3-us-6408703916655391000)\n\nShow More Deals\n\nWe check over 130 million products every day for the best prices\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 4\\.

You can use the UE app to link dozens of Boom 2s together, if you wish,\nand also link multiple mobile devices, and then have DJ wars. With 15 hours of\nbattery life, the party can go on way past your neighbours' tolerance limits.\n\nThe audio was incredibly good for a waterproof speaker when it first appeared.\nUltimate Ears have since raised the game still further with the Mega and\nWonder brothers, but it still sounds good. As ever with EU, Boom 2 is best\nsuited to pop, dance and hip-hop, but it delivers a bit more nuance than the\nWonderboom 2.\n\n![Best portable speaker: Bose SoundLink\nMicro](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 5\\.

For its size and weight, though, which are small even when\ncompared to the Beoplay P2 lozenge and UE Wonderboom hand grenade, you can't\ncomplain.\n\nIn a selection of bright colours, the Micro is an IPX7 waterproof (although it\ndoesn't float), low-profile (10x10.3.5cm) square. It puts in a solidly musical\nperformance when you take those factors into account, and the six-hour battery\nlife is also not bad considering its size.\n\nAn integrated rubber strap makes it fairly easy to attach to tent poles,\nbicycle frames, backpacks and so on, although you do have to have a bit of\nmuscle power to stretch it over thicker mounting points. In short, the Micro\nis the best of the really ultra-portable, all-weather speakers.

However,\nunlike many of these speakers, the Muo has a sound that's really suited to\nlistening to 'properly', in a quiet setting (rather than blasting out Katy\nPerry in your back garden). It's a very musical portable speaker, aimed at\nmore demanding listeners. It has no water resistance, and is fairly crap for\nblasting out Katy Perry at your next pool party.\n\nFor the kind of 'audiophile; audience that demands a more refined sound even\nfrom a small portable, the KEF Muo is an excellent deal. It's also arguably\nthe most attractive portable you can buy, with its metallic finish coming in a\nvariety of hues.\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 9\\.

Despite that it is,\nbizarrely, available at John Lewis and Partners, which is not _traditionally_\nthe home of all bloodclaat gansta yout' mans dem. As you can see, Monster's\nmonster is the 80s 'ghetto blaster' reimagined for the 2018. All that's\nmissing is a big button marked 'Bass BOOST', although there is one that\ntoggles between 'indoor' and 'outdoor' modes.\n\nTo be frank, no Bass BOOST button is required, such is the brutal bottom-end\nassault that fires from this thing when you push the volume up. With NFC for\neasy pairing (not that pairing via Bluetooth is exactly arduous), the\nSuperStar Blaster also has a 3.5mm input, perhaps for your DJ turntable, or to\nadd a microphone and 'throw down some verbal foulness, yo'. If you want party\nrocking rather than background music, this Monster will leave you feeling\nbugged out by its electric boogaloo.
