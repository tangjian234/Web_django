looks.\n\nSpeakers don\u2019t sit idle at Klipsch. The company is always looking for ways to\nevolve its products. Case in point is the new One II wireless speaker, a\nscaled-down follow-up to the excellent [Three wireless\nspeaker](https://www.soundandvision.com/content/klipsch-three-wireless-music-\nsystem) we reviewed a couple years ago.\n\n[Continue Reading \u00bb](/content/simple-sound-klipsch-one-ii-wireless-speaker)\n\n[Bluetooth Speaker Reviews](/category/bluetooth-speaker-reviews)[Smart Speaker\nReviews](/category/smart-speaker-reviews)[Wireless Multiroom Speaker\nReviews](/category/wireless-multiroom-speaker-reviews)\n\n[Sonos Move Portable Wireless Speaker Review](/content/sonos-move-portable-\nwireless-speaker-review)\n\n[Leslie Shapiro](/writer/80481 \"View more from Leslie Shapiro\") |  Oct 29,\n2019 |  [0 comments](/content/sonos-move-portable-wireless-speaker-\nreview#comments-link)\n\n[![](/images/styles/600_wide/public/1019sonos.hand_.jpg)](/content/sonos-move-\nportable-wireless-speaker-review)\n\n![](/images/toppick.cur.png)  \n\nPerformance  \nFeatures  \nErgonomics  \nValue  \n\n**PRICE** $399\n\n**AT A GLANCE**  \n**Plus**  \nFabulous sound quality  \nReplaceable battery  \nSupports Alexa and Google Assistant  \nConvenient charging base  \n**Minus**  \nMono playback  \nAudio input limited to wireless  \nNo phone capability\n\n**THE VERDICT**  \nThe waterproof/dustproof Move is one of the best-sounding and full-featured\nportables available. It may just be my new favorite speaker.\n\nSonos is no stranger to compact speakers that play without wires, but the new\nMove ($399) is the first truly portable, battery powered model to come from\nthe company. The Move's connectivity options let you tote it around the house\nand even outside when using Wi-Fi; beyond that, as long as it's charged up,\nyou can take it anywhere and stream music via Bluetooth. The Move comes with a\ndedicated (and dare we say, stylish) charging base that eliminates fumbling\naround with connecting cables, and it can also be charged via USB-C (cable not\nincluded).\n\n[Continue Reading \u00bb](/content/sonos-move-portable-wireless-speaker-review)\n\n[Bluetooth Speaker Reviews](/category/bluetooth-speaker-reviews)[Bookshelf\nSpeaker Reviews](/category/bookshelf-speaker-reviews)[Desktop Speaker\nReviews](/category/desktop-speaker-reviews)\n\n[Audioengine A2+ Wireless Speaker System\nReview](/content/audioengine-a2-wireless-speaker-system-review)\n\n[Al Griffin](/writer/80426 \"View more from Al Griffin\") |  Oct 15, 2019 |  [1\ncomments](/content/audioengine-a2-wireless-speaker-system-review#comments-\nlink)\n\n[![](/images/styles/600_wide/public/1019audioeng.promo_.jpg)](/content/audioengine-a2-wireless-\nspeaker-system-review)\n\n![](/images/toppick.cur.png)  \n\nPerformance  \nFeatures  \nErgonomics  \nValue  \n\n**PRICE** $269\n\n**AT A GLANCE**  \n**Plus**  \nWarm yet detailed sound  \nUltra-compact form factor  \nBluetooth streaming  \n**Minus**  \nNo front panel volume control  \nUSB input support maxes out at 24/48\n\n**THE VERDICT**  \nThe A2+ combines audiophile-friendly sound with the convenience of Bluetooth\nto create a broadly appealing compact speaker package.\n\nAudioengine is well-known for making affordable powered and passive speakers\nthat are compact enough for desktop use. Like several of the company's\nprevious offerings, its most recent model, the A2+, is a petite powered\nspeaker with multiple connectivity options, including wireless aptX Bluetooth\nstreaming. What makes it stand out from other Audioengine speakers?

The company has established substantial cred for its active\ndesktop and bookshelf speaker lines, both of which deliver high value and\nwidely noted performance. Now, with a new model called TUK, the company is\nmoving up-range in market-segment, size, and price. Also, utility: TUK is an\nall-in-one powered-speaker solution, with a phono-preamp, an asynchronous USB\nDAC, a headphone amp, preamp controls, a subwoofer crossover, and\namplification all built right in.\n\n[Continue Reading \u00bb](/content/kanto-tuk-powered-bookshelf-speakers)\n\n[Bluetooth Speaker Reviews](/category/bluetooth-speaker-reviews)\n\n[Kanto SYD Bluetooth Speaker Review](/content/kanto-syd-bluetooth-speaker-\nreview)\n\n[Bob Ankosko](/writer/33083 \"View more from Bob Ankosko\") |  Sep 26, 2018 |\n[0 comments](/content/kanto-syd-bluetooth-speaker-review#comments-link)\n\n[![](/images/styles/600_wide/public/092618_kanto_syd_promo.jpg)](/content/kanto-\nsyd-bluetooth-speaker-review)\n\n![](/images/toppick.cur.png)  \n\nPerformance  \nFeatures  \nBuild Quality  \nValue  \n\n**PRICE** $330\n\n**AT A GLANCE**  \n**Plus**  \nExcellent sound quality  \nCompact and well-built  \nEasy to set up and use  \nGreat value  \n**Minus**  \nNo Wi-Fi streaming  \nNo visual feedback  \nNo grille cover\n\n**THE VERDICT**  \nKanto\u2019s SYD is a simple, high-performance Bluetooth speaker that will wow you\nwith rich, powerful sound that belies its size.\n\nI could tell SYD was a serious speaker the moment I heard Joni Mitchell\nsinging \u201cA Case of You\u201d from 1971\u2019s _Blue_.

Which is why I jumped at the chance\nwhen asked if I had any interest in auditioning The Sixes, the latest entry in\nKlipsch\u2019s Heritage Wireless series and big brother to [The\nThree](https://www.soundandvision.com/content/klipsch-three-wireless-music-\nsystem), the superb all-in-one wireless music system we reviewed in May.

If there\u2019s one thing your studio apartment,\ndorm room, bedroom, or guest bedroom doesn\u2019t need, it\u2019s an audio rack with a\ntangle of cables. But going without music would be barbaric. So how simple do\nyou need to get? If a bare-bones Bluetooth speaker isn\u2019t enough, a pair of\npowered speakers might make more sense.

Amazon is hoping you\u2019ll pick\nAlexa, and Cortana is hoping to get some traction in the market. Once you\u2019re a\nGoogle family, odds are you\u2019ll stay there. To that end, JBL just released a\nnew line of Google Assistant voice-activated speakers, and the LINK 20 is the\nperfect balance of features, sound quality, and portability. Yup \u2014 that\u2019s\nright \u2014 a voice-assistant that\u2019s not only portable, it\u2019s waterproof too so it\ncan go anywhere.\n\n[Continue Reading \u00bb](/content/jbl-link-20-portable-stereo-google-assistant-\nspeaker-whats-not)\n\n[Bluetooth Speaker Reviews](/category/bluetooth-speaker-reviews)[Smart Speaker\nReviews](/category/smart-speaker-reviews)[Wireless Multiroom Speaker\nReviews](/category/wireless-multiroom-speaker-reviews)[Grace\nNotes](/category/grace-notes)\n\n[Harman/Kardon Invoke with Cortana: a Smart Speaker That Actually Sounds\nGreat](/content/harmankardon-invoke-cortana-smart-speaker-actually-sounds-\ngreat)\n\n[Leslie Shapiro](/writer/80481 \"View more from Leslie Shapiro\") |  Oct 23,\n2017 |  [0 comments](/content/harmankardon-invoke-cortana-smart-speaker-\nactually-sounds-great#comments-link)\n\n[![](/images/styles/600_wide/public/Invoke%20HK.jpg)](/content/harmankardon-\ninvoke-cortana-smart-speaker-actually-sounds-great)\n\nWhen a company known for making very good speakers and receivers comes out\nwith the first Cortana-based smart speaker, it better sound good.

Of\ncourse, any conversation today about \u201coutdoor audio\u201d needs to be placed in\nmodern context.
