You\u2019d want it to be as nice as those with a higher\nprice tag but more affordable. It\u2019s easy to get lost when you have no clue\nwhat makes a speaker the best one in its price category. But we\u2019re here to\nprovide a few insights into the subject. Let\u2019s dive in right now.\n\n#### Table of Contents\n\n  * JBL Flip 4\n  * Ears Boom 2\n  * Anker Soundcore Flare\n  * Sony XB10\n  * TREBLAB HD77\n  * Conclusion\n\n## Meet the best portable speakers under $100\n\nLet us introduce the top 7 models that cost less than a hundred bucks but\nworth every single penny due to their awesome features. In these Bluetooth\nspeaker reviews under $100, here are the principal aspects our selection is\nbased on:\n\n  * Sound quality\n  * Build quality\n  * Battery life\n  * Connectivity\n  * Additional features (accepting calls, Siri activation, NFC, etc.)\n\nNow, let\u2019s regard them closely.\n\n## JBL Flip 4\n\n![JBL Flip 4](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1593/5675/files/JBL-\nFlip-4.jpg?v=1574861428)\n\nThis model is a successful combination of wireless technology, affordability,\nand durability. It\u2019s ideal for hiking, having fun in the pool, camping trips.\nSuper portable and easy-to-use, it\u2019s a decent representative of the JBL\u2019s\nlineup.\n\n  * ### Great beats\n\n40 mm drivers pump out strong sound with a clear bass without boomy tones and\ntreble. However, at high pitches, it might lose clarity. The sound is not for\naudiophiles with a meticulous ear, but still it\u2019s great and bright.\n\nThey recommend using it particularly for outdoor events with lots of ambient\nnoise and avoid for indoor listening sessions.\n\n  * ### Durable and waterproof\n\nBest cheap portable speakers do not necessarily compromise on durability and\nbuild quality. And the Flip proves that. It comes in a rugged, fabric-mesh\nweave, and its caps are covered with rubbery plastic, stretched across the\nback of the speaker.\n\nThe Flip 4 has IPX7 waterproof rating. It means you can use it in a shower and\neven drop into the pool for ten minutes.\n\n  * ### 12-hour battery life\n\nThe manufacturer promises 12 hours of playtime. But if you use it at the\nhighest volume, you can have just ten hours, which is still pretty awesome.\nMoreover, it\u2019s also possible to use it as a power bank.\n\n  * ### Good connectivity\n\nBasically, the connectivity is ensured by the Bluetooth version and a signal\nrange. The Flip 4 features the Bluetooth 4.2 version. It is not bad\nconsidering that the latest one is 5.0. Besides, some reviewers say the signal\nrange is 20 feet, while the manufacturer has no info about it on the official\nsite. So, it's up to you to check this out!\n\n  * ### Calls and Siri activation\n\nThe speaker contains a built-in speakerphone that delivers loud and clear\nsound. It allows making calls, and the sound quality herewith is great. You\ncan also enable Siri and Google Assistant.\n\nIf you want to pump up your party, you can always pair this model with others\nthat contain the Connect+ feature. The Flip 4 comes in 6 colors.\n\n## Ears Boom 2\n\n![Ears Boom 2](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1593/5675/files/Ears-\nBoom.jpg?v=1574861453)\n\nIt is a smart speaker which is designed ergonomically. There\u2019s nothing extra\nhere. Simple by look, but powerful by features.\n\n  * ### 360\u00b0 sound and rich bass \n\nThe sound is surround and gives the feeling of diving into the music. It\ndelivers a profound bass, and at high volume, it doesn\u2019t crackle.\n\n  * ### Beat it up\n\nThe build quality is amazing - you can shake it or let it fall - the speaker\nwill survive. The speaker is shock-, and IPX7 waterproof and \u201cwrapped\u201d in\npremium materials.\n\n  * ### 15-hour battery life\n\nThe manufacturer states that the battery lasts for 15 hours. Many users would\nagree that at low volume you can eke out ten hours, but at high - merely 2-4\nhours.\n\n  * ### Excellent connectivity\n\nThe brand promises that this item has a 100 feet Bluetooth wireless range,\nwhich is quite impressive. The version of Bluetooth isn\u2019t provided.\n\n  * ### UE Boom app\n\nThe app allows pairing wirelessly more than 150 Ultimate Ears speakers. With\nthe app, you can use the features, such as Customizable EQ, Remove On/Off,\nBlock Party, Tap Controls, etc. You can also make calls and enable NFC.\n\n## Anker Soundcore Flare\n\n![Anker Soundcore Flare](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1593/5675/files/Anker-\nSoundcore-Flare.jpg?v=1574861474)\n\nThe speaker is one of the best cheap speakers for music reproduction outdoors.\nThe price is really competitive in terms of affordability and usability ratio.\nLet\u2019s have a closer look.\n\n  * ### Detailed, bright sound at high volumes\n\nThe double 6-watt drivers deliver stereo in all directions.The sound gets\nimpressively loud at high volume and particularly stands out for a profound\nbass. Even if the track gets a top volume, there\u2019s no distortion here. The\nvocals are very clear and detailed.\n\n  * ### Cloth grill and rubberized construction\n\nThe Flare\u2019s outer panel is covered with a nice cloth grill, and the bottom one\nis rubberized. It is also IPX7 waterproof, which means you can immerse it up\nto one meter in water.\n\n  * ### 12-hours playtime\n\nOfficially, the speaker\u2019s battery lasts for 12 hours. But it also depends on\nthe level of volume, settings, using LEDs.\n\n  * ### Good connectivity\n\nThe Flare features the Bluetooth version 4.2. There\u2019s no signal range\ninformation publicly available.\n\n  * ### Soundcore app \n\nIf you have any of Soundcore devices, then this speaker is for you. With the\napp, you can customize sound profiles and lighting. For example, to regulate\nthe sound, you can pick between Voice, Flat, or Chill; as for lighting -\nChill, Bedtime, Spring, Energy, or Party modes. Each mode has sub-modes as\nwell.\n\n## Sony XB10\n\n![Sony  XB10](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1593/5675/files/Sony-\nXB10.jpg?v=1574861501)\n\nIt can be boldly dubbed the best wireless speaker under $100 because of its\nsize and yet almost the full package of everything a speaker must have. It\nstands out for a punchy bass and mic and stereo pairing feature.\n\n  * ### Balanced sound with profound bass\n\nThe XB10 delivers articulate mids, and the vocals are very bright. The bass is\npowerful, without treble at high volume. However, when gaining above 70% of\nvolume, it might have distortions.\n\n  * ### Matte silicone finish\n\nThe speaker features grill at the top. The construction is covered with matte\nsilicone finish. The manufacturer claims it is splashproof. It can survive\nbeing thrown into the pool or bathtub but it\u2019s not what it was made for.\n\n  * ### 16-hour battery life\n\nSony promises it will last for 16 hours. Again, when it\u2019s about speakers, the\nbattery life always depends on the level of volume and other settings that\nmake it discharge.\n\n  * ### Standard connectivity\n\nThe XB10 connects to another device via Bluetooth and NFC. The latter doesn\u2019t\nmake a huge difference since it just connects within 4 cm. The signal range is\n33 feet.\n\n  * ### True stereo and NFC\n\nThe speaker might grab attention thanks to its capacity to pair with another\none for true stereo. It has a speakerphone to manage calls. There\u2019s an awesome\naccessory in the box - a cord for pending it with an oval loop.\n\n## TREBLAB HD77\n\n![TREBLAB HD77](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1593/5675/files/Treblab-\nHD77.jpg?v=1574861531)\n\nThis one is 100% the loudest Bluetooth speaker under $100. It\u2019s like a music\nstatue on the move. The HD77 has everything you need in a portable wireless\nspeaker. The speaker is designed to turn any outdoor event into a music\nfestival.\n\n[Look at TREBLAB HD77](https://treblab.com/products/treblab-hd77)\n\n  * ### Detailed 360\u00b0 HD Sound and DualBass subwoofers\n\nThe audio is really powerful here. Not only is it crystal clear, but\nvoluminous and with a rich bass from two sides. The True Wireless Stereo\ntechnology that\u2019s included in the product allows it to couple with another\nspeaker to double the volume and expand the audio stage. This has a\nmesmerizing effect!\n\n  * ### Shockproof and water-resistant\n\nThe HD77 is not afraid of rain since it is certified with the IPX6 waterproof\nrating. Throw, let it fall, or shake it - the speaker will survive thanks to a\nreliable, rugged construction.\n\n![Shockproof and water-resistant\nHD77](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1593/5675/files/HD77.jpg?v=1574861572)\n\n  * ### 12-hour battery life\n\nYou can literally use it the whole day on a single charge. It has signature\nPlayXTend energy-saving and high-capacity 5200mAh battery that allows it to\nstream for 12 hours nonstop.\n\n  * ### Ideal connectivity\n\nTop Bluetooth speakers under $100 use the 4.2 version for the best possible\nconnectivity. So does the HD77. Besides, it has a SBC audio codec that\ntransmits ideally the sound from both iOS and Android. The signal range here\nis 33 feet.\n\n[Look at TREBLAB HD77](https://treblab.com/products/treblab-hd77)\n\n  * ### Inserted microphone for calls\n\nYou can make calls and not to worry about the sound reproduction. Also, there\nare LEDs to set the mood at the parties. The speaker comes with a hand strap\nand carabiner to suspend on your backpack.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs you can see from the review, the best cheap portable Bluetooth speakers may\nsurprise with great functionality, solid build, water-resistance, and\noutstanding audio performance.\n\nWhat is it that you need the most? Deep bass or more balanced tones at lows,\nmids, and highs? Do you want LEDs? Does the water-resistance rating matter to\nyou? In short, these best speakers for under $100 are capable of meeting these\nneeds perfectly.\n\nTo make your choice even easier, look at the following comparison table:\n\n|\n\n**JBL Flip 4**\n\n$99.95\n\n|\n\n**Ears Boom 2**\n\n$98.95\n\n|\n\n**Anker Soundcore Flare**\n\n$62.00\n\n|\n\n**Sony XB10**\n\n$39.99-58.00\n\n|\n\n**TREBLAB HD77**\n\n$79.00  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n**Sound quality**\n\n|\n\n  * strong sound with a clear bass without boomy tones and treble\n  * oat high pitches, it might lose clarity\n\n|\n\n  * surround sound \n  * deep bass, and at high volume\n  * No crackles\n\n|\n\n  * stereo in all directions\n  * loud at high volume and deep bass\n  * at top volume, there\u2019s no distortion \n  * clear, detailed vocals\n\n|\n\n  * articulate mids\n  * vocals are very bright\n  * powerful bass without treble at high volume\n  * when playing above 70% volume, it might have distortions \n\n|\n\n  * Crisp 360\u00b0 HD Sound and DualBass double subwoofers\n  * rich bass from both sides\n\n  \n  \n**Build quality**\n\n|\n\n  * rugged, fabric-mesh weave\n  * its caps are covered with rubbery plastic, stretched across the back of the speaker\n  * IPX7 waterproof rating.\n\n|\n\n  * shock-, and IPX7 waterproof \n  * \u201cwrapped\u201d in premium materials\n\n|\n\n  * nice cloth grill\n  * rubberized\n  * IPX7 waterproof \n\n|\n\n  * grill at the top\n  * matte silicone finish\n  * splashproof\n\n|\n\n  * Shockproof and IPX6 water-resistant\n  * rugged construction\n\n  \n  \n**Connectivity**\n\n|\n\n  * Bluetooth 4.2 version\n  * Signal range is 20 feet\n\n|\n\n  * 100 feet signal range\n  * Bluetooth version is not provided \n\n|\n\n  * Bluetooth version 4.2. \n  * no signal range information\n\n|\n\n  * Bluetooth and NFC\n  * 33 feet signal range\n\n|\n\n  * Bluetooth version 4.2.\n  * 33 feet signal range\n\n  \n  \n**Battery life**\n\n|\n\n12 hours\n\n|\n\n15 hours\n\n|\n\n12 hours\n\n|\n\n16 hours\n\n|\n\n12 hours  \n  \n**Additional features**\n\n|\n\n  * Calls and Siri activation\n  * pairing with others via the Connect+ feature\n\n|\n\n  * UE Boom app to pair wirelessly more than 150 Ultimate Ears speakers \n  * calls and enable NFC\n\n|\n\n  * Soundcore app to adjust sound profile and lighting\n\n|\n\n  * pairing with another one for true stereo\n  * speakerphone to manage calls\n  * a cord for pending it with an oval loop\n\n|\n\n  * Bluetooth 4.2 version\n  * 33 feet signal range\n  * TWS -pairing with another one for true stereo\n\n  \n  \n[Look at TREBLAB HD77](https://treblab.com/products/treblab-hd77)\n\n## Comments\n\nWhat do you think?
