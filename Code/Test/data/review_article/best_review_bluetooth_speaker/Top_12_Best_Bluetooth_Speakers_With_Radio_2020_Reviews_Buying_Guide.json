Hollen\")\n\nLooking for the Best Bluetooth Speakers with Radio means we are going to be\nfaced with different designs \u2014 the styling of cabinets that may influence our\ndecision to buy.\n\nKierkegaard, the Danish Philosopher, wrote, \u201cWe live our lives moving forward\nand then understand them by looking back.\u201d This, of course, is great wisdom\nthat has never been appreciated by world leaders who consistently take us to\nwar. But then you do need a modicum of intelligence to understand Philosophy\nso we shouldn\u2019t expect too much of them.\n\n![best bluetooth speakers with\nradio](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![best\nbluetooth speakers with radio](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/best-bluetooth-speakers-with-radio-1.jpg)\n\nAuthentic\u2026\n\nThe point being, in our modern lives, we find security, learning, and\nunderstanding by looking back as we move forward. Learning from previous\nmistakes might be an easier way to put it. This is the reason we like things\nfrom the past. This manifests itself in many ways, but sometimes in making\nthings look \u2018authentic.\u2019\n\nWe love things to be the \u201960s or 70s\u2019 or other decades. Our music, our\ngadgets, even sometimes our furniture and devices all come under this\numbrella.\n\nSome of the products we are about to look at are doing exactly that, taking us\nback in time. Others don\u2019t and remain true to the modern style. It gives us a\nchoice and a certain nostalgia. Bluetooth is modern technology. It has become\nan essential part of our lives and especially a part of our listening\nexperience. It is now embedded in our speaker systems and is significant in\nhow we listen to our music.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s go through some high-quality Bluetooth speakers with\nradio and find the perfect one for you\u2026\n\nContents\n\n  * Top 12 Best Bluetooth Speakers With Radio To Buy 2020 Reviews\n    * 1 ION Audio Tailgater (iPA77) | Portable Bluetooth PA Speaker\n    * 2 Sbode Bluetooth Speaker\n    * 3 Pyle Wireless Active PA Speaker System\n    * 4 Libratone Zipp Wifi Bluetooth Smart Speaker\n    * 5 Anker Soundcore Flare Mini Bluetooth Speaker\n    * 6 Rerii Handmade Walnut Wood Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n    * 7 Pyle Retro Wireless Bluetooth Radio Speaker\n    * 8 Tivoli Audio M1BTCLA Bluetooth AM/FM Radio\n    * 9 Bluetooth Speaker by Celtic Blu\n    * 10 Soundance FM Radio Wireless Bluetooth Speaker\n    * 11 Avantree Portable FM Radio With Bluetooth\n    * 12 ZoeeTree S8 Bluetooth Speakers V5.0\n  * Best Bluetooth Speakers With Radio Buyer\u2019s Guide\n    * What Do You Want From Your Speaker?\n    * What About The Look?\n    * Budget\n  * So, What Are The Best Bluetooth Speakers With Radio?\n\n## Top 12 Best Bluetooth Speakers With Radio To Buy 2020 Reviews\n\n  1.

It was founded in 2002 and is part of InMusic Brands. They manufacture\na range of electronic and audio systems but especially known for the speakers\nand Bluetooth linked products.\n\nIt is a tough, well-built unit made from MDF with some plastic fittings and\nhas reinforced corners, so it will take a few bumps. And it is a compact size\nat 9.21 inches by 12.5 by 13 inches but is no lightweight weighing nearly\nseventeen pounds. It hasn\u2019t got wheels to move it around. So if you are taking\nit out, it will have to be carried.\n\nIndoors not out\u2026\n\nBuilt-in is a woofer and tweeter. They have a frequency range of 77 Hz-20 kHz.\nIt is rated at 50 watts, but in RMS, that is probably around 25-30watts. It\nwill best be used inside rather than outdoors, we think. And has a\nrechargeable battery giving up to 50 hours os fuse before a recharge is\nnecessary.\n\nObviously comes with Bluetooth connectivity, and there is an app for IOS or\nAndroid users tom give you more control. There is a USB port, but that is only\nfor charging any devices that may be connected to it.\n\nFancy singing a song?\n\nIt has AM and FM and has the capability to store six AM stations and six FM.\nThere is a sturdy rubber aerial. There is a bright-colored display on the\nfront of the Tailgater that gives basic connectivity information. It has a\nmicrophone, so it could be a great little basic karaoke machine for parties.\n\nThere are a master volume and a separate volume for the mic. It has a \u215b\u201d inch\ninput for connecting your CD player or other devices with the correct\nfittings.\n\nSet at a reasonable price point, it is a good little machine for small\ngatherings.\n\n[ ![ION Audio Tailgater \\(iPA77\\) | Portable Bluetooth PA\nSpeaker](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![ION\nAudio Tailgater \\(iPA77\\) | Portable Bluetooth PA Speaker](https://images-\nna.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/51RWgNRhW6L._AC_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SNBCBGE/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.3 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.3\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.3) (4.3 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SNBCBGE/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __Well-made with sturdy construction.\n  *  __Some good connection options at a reasonable price.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __Some will want more power and features.\n\n### `2` Sbode Bluetooth Speaker\n\nThis Bluetooth speaker from Sbode is certainly not much of a party animal. But\nas a personal speaker system, it has a lot going for it. It has certainly got\na tough build. We often think this design tends to look like one of those\nheavyweight industrial torches you see. Of course, for this product, it is an\nideal design.\n\nThe black rubber and fabric design give it a rugged feeling, and this is\nenforced by the metal radiators at each end. It is listed as being rainproof\nand splashproof, but it is not suitable to be submerged. Therefore it is great\nfor the pool or the beach but don\u2019t drop it in the water.\n\nSearch and store\u2026\n\nIt has Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity with the usual distance of about 100 feet\nfor use. And it has an FM radio with automatic and manual search facilities.\nPlus, it also lets you store your favorite stations.\n\nIt is a nice compact size at 7.4 inches by 2.7 by 2.7 inches and weighs just\none pound. And it will deliver nine watts of output so enough for a few people\naround the pool or on the beach. It is not going to drive a party, though.\n\nA little lacking in the low end\u2026\n\nThere is a built-in microphone, and it has a battery life of about eight\nhours. The sound is quite good, with two drivers producing a decent sound. But\nif we are honest, a little underpowered in the low-frequencies.\n\nControls are easily managed but are not labeled particularly well, which is a\nnegative in our view. The micro-USB and microSD memory slots are placed under\na flap below the control buttons. There is a 3.5mm Auxillary input.\n\nThis is a decent water-resistant speaker, but it has its limitations. The\nmaterials used for the actual water prevention are not helpful in producing a\ngreat sound. The sound, therefore, is not the best. We don\u2019t think you can\nexpect it to be. And it is lacking a little bit in volume, which is a shame\nbecause it is a good little system. But for the price and what it does, it is\na good buy.\n\n[ ![Sbode Bluetooth\nSpeaker](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Sbode\nBluetooth Speaker](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/81Y6gfuliNL._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071DGXVWB/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.3 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.3\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.3) (4.3 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071DGXVWB/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __Strong build with good materials and splashproof.\n  *  __Affordable price with some nice features.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __A little underpowered and lacking quality sound reproduction.\n\n### `3` Pyle Wireless Active PA Speaker System\n\nPyle does like to make a lot of noise at times, and this active speaker is\ncertainly designed to do that. It has two 10-inch woofers and two three-inch\ntweeters that drive a claimed 1000 watts, or 500 watts RMS with a prominent\nbottom end.\n\nThis is built for partying and even has its own array of flashing LED lights.\nThat is going to add the \u2018disco\u2019 feel to your outdoor party.\n\nGuitar or mic?\n\nIt has Bluetooth connectivity for streaming music and will give you access to\nyour iOS or Android phone or tablet to play music from your own libraries. It\nis fitted with an SD card reader and a USB flash drive, as well as the 3.5mm\naux input. There are also inputs that will take a guitar or a microphone.\n\nThis speaker can now take on a different role. With its flashing lights and\nvolume potential, it becomes a pretty powerful karaoke machine. It also has an\nFM radio.\n\nEverything you need for full-on karaoke fun!\n\nThe control panel on the top is nothing if not impressive. Jack sockets for\ntwo microphones and a guitar or keyboard with separate microphone and guitar\nlevel controls. There is an echo effect, an EQ switch, and separate bass and\ntreble controls. There is also an Aux audio input and a master volume.\n\nPride of place, though, goes to a 7-channel EQ with sliders. There is also a\ndigital LCD display. On the back are connections for extra passive speakers if\nrequired, an off and on switch for the lights, the antenna, and RCA\nconnectors.\n\nNot exactly compact\u2026\n\nIt is quite a size at 15.75 inches by 14 by 37.25 inches and weighing 43.44\nlbs. And it does not operate from batteries just from AC power. Also, it has a\nremote control unit, which is always a useful addition to any sound system.\n\nThis is a big powerful speaker with Bluetooth capability that can also be used\nfor karaoke. It lends itself to the party style. Probably not something you\nmight use at home for just listening to music. It has an affordable price\npoint\n\n[ ![Pyle Wireless Active PA Speaker\nSystem](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Pyle\nWireless Active PA Speaker System](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/610J04NU%2BJL._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EM7C89I/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.2 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.2\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.2) (4.2 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EM7C89I/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __Strong build with plenty of volume.\n  *  __Good for parties and even karaoke.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __Not for those who want to just have some music at home.\n\n### `4` Libratone Zipp Wifi Bluetooth Smart Speaker\n\nLibratone is a Danish company that excels as an audio equipment manufacturer.\nCouple that up with Danish design excellence, and we are in for a treat. If we\nare looking for the best quality Bluetooth speakers with radio, we might not\nhave to look too much further.\n\nRugged and practical\u2026\n\nThis version of the Zipp resembles the original version that came out in 2012.\nIt has been upgraded with a different control panel and the inclusion of\nBluetooth 4.0 capability. But it has kept its practical, rugged design.\n\nThe design is similar to others, but just a little bigger. The Zipp is 4.8\ninches by 4.8 by 10.3 inches and weighs three pounds. As the name indicates,\nyou can remove the outer, zipper cover, which will reveal two one-inch\ntweeters and a four-inch woofer. There are also two four-inch low-frequency\nradiators.\n\nA Class D amp delivers 100 watts of sound and features Digital Signal\nProcessing. The bottom has a rubber coating to ensure stability when it is\nused in an upright position.\n\nAll-around sound!\n\nThe speaker has an efficient design that projects the sound in almost 360\ndegrees. It has a backlit control panel on the top edge. They have been\ncreative with the design of the controls.\n\nThe Libratone logo of a bird acts as the play and pause and also the Bluetooth\npairing control. There is a heart button that helps you set up and store five\nof your favorite radio stations. A sound space button lets you link external\nspeakers. To adjust the volume, you run your finger around the top of the\nunit. This reveals dots that indicate the volume level.\n\nAnd the sound it delivers?\n\nThe only word you can use is impressive. It reminds us of the first time we\nsaw a Bang and Olufsen stereo unit. They were Danish as well.\n\nIt offers various ways to listen to music and links perfectly with your\ndevices. It will reconnect to the last used device and has a standard 30 feet\nrange. There is a 3.5mm socket which expands the connectivity options. It is\ncompatible for use with Alexa.\n\nAlthough it carries so many features, some we haven\u2019t even mentioned, It is\neasy to use and at a very affordable price \u2014 a great speaker with Bluetooth\nthat can be used at home or for parties.\n\n[ ![Libratone Zipp Wifi Bluetooth Smart\nSpeaker](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Libratone\nZipp Wifi Bluetooth Smart Speaker](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/61L7TDyGltL._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017WOOYE4/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.3 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.3\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.3) (4.3 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017WOOYE4/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __Great Danish design with superb functions and build quality.\n  *  __Powerful, clear sound at an affordable cost.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __The price might put some people off.\n\n### `5` Anker Soundcore Flare Mini Bluetooth Speaker\n\nAnker has given us a compact little speaker with a variety of uses. At 3.4\ninches by 2.8 by 5.6 inches, it certainly isn\u2019t going to take up too much\nroom. And at just over one pound in weight, it is easy to carry around. Its\ncircular design delivers an all-round 360 degrees sound.\n\nIt isn\u2019t particularly loud with just two drivers and dual radiators with a\npower output of 10 watts. It might only be a small unit, but it has a big\nlight show. Eight separate LEDs with five different lighting settings allow\nyou to add a bit of atmosphere to the party.\n\nSuperb for the seaside or poolside\u2026\n\nYou can take it around the pool as it has an IPX7 rating, which means it is ok\nin the rain or just getting wet. It even allows for submersion for up to 30\nminutes though we don\u2019t recommend you try it.\n\nIt is powered by Li-ion battery that gives about 12 hours of use, which is\nbetter than some.

It\noperates with most smartphones, tablets, and laptops, but it doesn\u2019t have an\nAux-in.\n\nA little underpowered\u2026\n\nIt is a small little speaker that will serve a function; however, it might be\na bit underpowered by it can be linked up.

Plus, it will operate while it\u2019s being charged.\n\nBasic and practical\u2026\n\nThe radio has both AM and FM capability via Bluetooth, and the micro-USB cable\nacts as an aerial. It is not a loudspeaker system, that is not what it is for.\nIt has a power rating 0f 8 watts, 4 watts RMS, so that is a comfortable use\nindoors.\n\nThe sound is quite good, clear, and quite bright but lacking a little in the\nlow frequencies. We think this is a super little speaker with a great design\nand well worth its modest price point. It is very basic, but that is what it\nis supposed to be.\n\n[ ![Rerii Handmade Walnut Wood Portable Bluetooth\nSpeaker](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Rerii\nHandmade Walnut Wood Portable Bluetooth Speaker](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/81W%2BlurRIaL._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076DWB4GG/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![5 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![5\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=5) (5 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076DWB4GG/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __Nice design, hand made from walnut.\n  *  __Decent sound with acceptable power rating for use at home at an affordable price point.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __Some will want more power.\n\n### `7` Pyle Retro Wireless Bluetooth Radio Speaker\n\nAnother return to the mind of Kierkegaard with this retro speaker design from\nPyle. That is an interesting idea in itself that Pyle has manufactured this\nspeaker. They are better known for their modern-day blow your head off speaker\nsystems.\n\nThey have produced a really nice, quaint, old-fashioned looking speaker your\nGranny would have appreciated. As we say, that is interesting in itself.\nNevertheless, here it is a classic style from the days when our early radios\nwere made from something called \u2018bakelite.\u2019 It has that vintage style, but\nit\u2019s full of modern technology. Not a bad combination.\n\nQuality stereo sound\u2026\n\nIt is Bluetooth 2.1 compatible and will pair up with your devices\n-smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Without obstacles, it will operate at the\nusual 30-meter distance. There is an Aux input. That allows you to connect MP3\nor CD players, and it also has a USB flash drive. The USB can also be used for\ncharging external devices. There are twin speakers to give you a decent stereo\neffect.\n\nThe control layout has stayed almost true to its retro design. It has a large\ncentral display, albeit in color which we wouldn\u2019t have had,-never mind, and\nother rotary controls. These are the off/on and volume, selector for AM/FM and\nUSB, and a station tuner.\n\nAttractive and affordable\u2026\n\nIt is a decent size as well, so it is going to be prominent in a room.\nMeasuring 14 inches by 8.8 by 10.2 inches, it weighs seven pounds. It is made\nfrom MDF fiberboard and has an attractive finish. The price point is set at an\naffordable level.\n\n[ ![Pyle Retro Wireless Bluetooth Radio\nSpeaker](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Pyle\nRetro Wireless Bluetooth Radio Speaker](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/71SYCW16FsL._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013OVZ588/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.2 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.2\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.2) (4.2 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013OVZ588/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __Nice retro design with easy to use controls.\n  *  __Affordable price.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __Larger than most and quite heavy.\n\n### `8` Tivoli Audio M1BTCLA Bluetooth AM/FM Radio\n\nAnother attempt at delving into the past for design, though this one is hard\nto give a timeframe too. It has the feeling that they wanted to do it but\ndidn\u2019t get the \u2018vintage\u2019 idea quite right. However, it isn\u2019t a bad design; it\njust doesn\u2019t have that feel of a time that some do.\n\nBasic and functional\u2026\n\nIt has a wood veneer finish in a Beige color, which is not particularly\nappealing and is a compact little speaker at 5.2 inches by 8.4 by 4.5 inches.\nIt weighs just over four pounds, which is quite heavy for its size.\n\nFeaturing two operational modes, the first of which is a straightforward radio\nwith AM and FM. And secondly, the Bluetooth connection allows you to listen to\nyour music or stream from other sites. It pairs up quite simply with your\nsmartphone, tablet, or your laptop. For sound, it relies upon a 3-inch long-\nthrow driver covered with a metal grille. The faceplate is also metal, and it\nhas a 3.5mm socket.\n\nA maritime look?\n\nControls are very easy to use and well-labeled. Besides the speaker covering,\nyou have a volume control and a selector switch. This allows you to choose\nbetween AM, FM, and Bluetooth or Aux. We like the large dial for tuning the\nsignal. Does it resemble something you might see on a boat? Or is it just us?\n\nIt should be noted that this does not use battery power. It is a mains unit\nsupply only. Neither does it have a remote control.\n\nRather bland and uninspiring\u2026\n\nIt is a basic radio with not a great deal in the way of features. Having a\nseparate built-in radio is a nice idea. The design is rather bland and\nuninspiring, which makes this quite an expensive speaker at its price point.\n\n[ ![Tivoli Audio M1BTCLA Bluetooth AM/FM\nRadio](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Tivoli\nAudio M1BTCLA Bluetooth AM/FM Radio](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/81LHIbnXgCL._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DJEKJG/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.4 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.4\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.4) (4.4 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DJEKJG/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __Well-made with decent materials.\n  *  __Separate radio and Bluetooth functions.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __Quite expensive for what it is.\n\n### `9` Bluetooth Speaker by Celtic Blu\n\nThese days we have speakers that are designed for many different situations.\nThis is one of those products. What is it suitable for?\n\nLet\u2019s deal with any confusion first of all\u2026\n\nSome of the advertising material call this product waterproof. It has an IPX4\nrating. That is water-resistant. Quite a different thing. It will be ok in the\nrain, but it cannot go in the pool. Waterproofed products can be submerged for\nup to 30 minutes or even longer.\n\nThis is a unit that can be used in a lot of situations, even on your bicycle,\nfor which it has a mount. It will actually fit a variety of uses. It has 16\nwatts of power, which is adequate for it to be heard in exterior environments\nand has a 360-degree audio circle.\n\nRing, ring\u2026\n\nFeaturing a built-in rechargeable Ion battery, the battery life is impressive\nat about 30 hours. It is Bluetooth compatible and given a clear line of sight,\nhas a standard 100 feet range. There is a microphone that allows you to take\ncalls hands-free.\n\nA good feature is that it will interrupt the music when a call comes through,\nmeaning you don\u2019t need to. A useful addition is the power bank, which allows\nyou to charge any other devices you may have.\n\nThe FM radio gets you a good service, and there is a built-in antenna. If you\nwant to use other sources, there is a TF card facility with 32 GB of memory.\nIt is well-built with a rugged design and includes a remote control, a USB\ncable, and 3.5mm Aux Cable. And it is a compact size measuring 7.1 inches by\n2.7 by 2.7 inches and weighing just 1.3 pounds.\n\nSeems expensive for what it is\u2026\n\nIt is a good little speaker and will be able to cope with a variety of\nenvironments. It is though quite expensive.\n\n[ ![Bluetooth Speaker by Celtic\nBlu](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Bluetooth\nSpeaker by Celtic Blu](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/71y6FSRkc0L._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LY6UKCL/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.4 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.4\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.4) (4.4 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LY6UKCL/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __Quite a sturdy speaker that will cope in most outdoor environments.\n  *  __Some useful built-in features.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __It might be considered a little expensive.\n\n### `10` Soundance FM Radio Wireless Bluetooth Speaker\n\nSoundance has come up with an interesting design for this speaker. Known as an\n**oblique trapezoidal structure** (sorry we just had to say it). It resembles\na soundbar you might see in someone\u2019s living room. Measuring just 9.5 inches\nby 2.2 by 2.5 inches, it is a compact speaker that is also lightweight at 14.4\nounces.\n\nIt fulfills three functions\u2026\n\nIt is, of course, a speaker with Bluetooth 3.0 connectivity and has a\ndedicated FM radio. They have also included an alarm clock, which we think is\na great addition. It takes TF and Micro SD cards and has USB and 3.5mm\nconnections for external music selection from MP3s, etc.\n\nIt has a built-in rechargeable battery that will give you up to eight hours of\nplaytime. That might be its weak point as that is not a great deal of playback\ntime. There is a built-in microphone for hands-free calling.\n\nOn the FM radio, there is an auto-search facility. Easy to use, it will locate\nand save stations of your choice. There is a manual adjustment to fine-tune\nthe signal. If you are in an area where there is a bad reception by connecting\nthe USB or Aux cable, you will strengthen the signal.\n\nNice display but average sound\u2026\n\nOn the front is a nicely designed illuminated LED panel where brief\ninformation is displayed. It also displays the time in 24 hours status only.\nThe sound can best be described as adequate.\n\nIt has two 40mm drivers that generate 6 watts each. As with all speakers with\nthese facilities, it is the low frequencies that suffer a bit. Generally\nspeaking, the sound is no better ot=r no worse than most other units of this\nsize.\n\nWe think this is a decent little speaker and, at the price point, excellent\nvalue for money. Given its price and the extra little features built-in, it\ncould be considered one of the best value Bluetooth speakers with radio\navailable.\n\n[ ![Soundance FM Radio Wireless Bluetooth\nSpeaker](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Soundance\nFM Radio Wireless Bluetooth Speaker](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/71b13qnIoTL._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LTG0NBU/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.2 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.2\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.2) (4.2 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LTG0NBU/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __Nice build and design, and easy to use.\n  *  __Built-in alarm clock and decent sounds at an affordable price.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __Battery life only eight hours.\n\n### `11` Avantree Portable FM Radio With Bluetooth\n\nNow, back to the future, we go again.

And has a modest output of 3 watts across a frequency range of 90Hz to\n18kHz.\n\nIt has three operational modes. Firstly utilizing its Bluetooth 2.1\nconnections to stream music from your devices, and it has the standard range.\nThen it is an FM radio that has a search and save facility, or thirdly you can\nlisten to your own music via the Micro SD card.\n\nThere is a rechargeable battery, but it only has about 6 hours of charge when\nused with Bluetooth. To get a full charge takes about two hours.\n\nNicely designed\u2026\n\nThe controls are neatly positioned as buttons across the top of the speaker.\nThe volume control dial, headphone socket, and 3.5mm Aux along with the SD\ncard port on the side. All very easy to locate and adequately labeled. It as\nsix basic EQ modes designed to enhance your listening depending on the genre\nof music.\n\nThe sound quality is adequate if a little quiet. Playing it too loud will\ncause distortion depending on what sort of music it is. It is a fun little\nradio and not designed to be carried around too much and certainly isn\u2019t for\nanything more than maybe a few hours a day.\n\nAt the price point, it is a great little buy if you just need a few hours of\nmusic or to listen to the news.\n\n[ ![Avantree Portable FM Radio With\nBluetooth](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![Avantree\nPortable FM Radio With Bluetooth](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/61JgkO5RzCL._AC_SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J3N8ICQ/?tag=1stmusic-20)  \n\n**Our rating:**![4.5 out of 5\nstars](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=)![4.5\nout of 5 stars](https://oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/plugins/universal-star-\nrating/includes/image.php?img=01.png&px=18&max=5&rat=4.5) (4.5 / 5)\n\n  \n\n[ Check Price on Amazon\n__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J3N8ICQ/?tag=1stmusic-20)\n\nPros\n\n  *  __Nice nostalgic look about it.\n  *  __It has some nice features at an affordable price.\n\nCons\n\n  *  __Some will just want more volume and a better sound.\n\n### `12` ZoeeTree S8 Bluetooth Speakers V5.0\n\nAnother Bluetooth speaker design that could have been lifted from a 70s museum\nin terms of its look. It isn\u2019t the most powerful speaker giving out a modest\n10 watts. But the sound is actually well-rounded and the bass not completely\nlost as is often the case.\n\nIt is a plastic build but quite sturdy and suitable for outside use at\nparties, though the power might be a little quiet. Also, it has built-in\nBluetooth 5.0 capability with a stable connection. It is compatible with Echo\nDot. It will also operate with iOS, Android, and Windows devices.
