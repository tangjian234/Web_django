If you visit\nthe [Portable Bluetooth Speakers category](https://amzn.to/2XCB03R) on\nAmazon.com you\u2019ll find more than 2000 speakers to pick from! If you filter by\nonly those with a rating of 4.5 stars or higher, you still end up with more\nthan 1000. So, where do you start?\n\n## ![The Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n1](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjAwIDEyOSIgd2lkdGg9IjIwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMjkiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)  \n[OontZ Angle 3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073BVWRSP/?tag=outeraudio-20)\n\nDon\u2019t let its small size fool you, the sound produced by the OontZ Angle 3 is\nabsolutely remarkable for such a small speaker. The high-quality sound is more\nthan loud enough to fill a room without any distortion and the accompanying\nbass is unbelievable.  \n\n[ **Check Price**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073BVWRSP/?tag=outeraudio-20)\n\n![Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle\n3](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTczIDUwMCIgd2lkdGg9IjU3MyIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1MDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)\n\nThere are quite a few factors that you\u2019ll have to take into consideration\nbefore making your purchase. The intended use of the speaker will obviously\nplay a big role, for example, do you lead an active lifestyle and want to take\nthe speaker with you on sporting events or do you like chilling in the park\nwith friends and just want something funky to provide some background tunes.\n\n## How did we pick these speakers?\n\nWe understand that everyone has their own unique set of features that they\nvalue when considering a Bluetooth speaker. So what did we look at in\nselecting speakers for this list and making our ultimate recommendation? Here\nare some of the features we considered:\n\n  * Sound Quality\n  * Portability (more on that below)\n  * Design Quality and Materials\n  * Waterproof Ratings and Durability\n  * Battery Life\n  * Bluetooth Range and Connectivity\n  * Value for Money\n\nI wish I could tell you we then weighed each of these options scientifically\nand mathematically but let\u2019s face it, that weighting would be subjective in\nitself, so we simply leaned on years of experience and hours of comparing, and\npicked what we believed to be the best portable Bluetooth speakers on the\nmarket today. We\u2019ll keep on updating and changing this list as new speakers\nare released, or whenwe change our minds!\n\n## What does \u201cPortable\u201d mean?\n\nI think we can all readily agree that a portable speaker should be capable of\nbeing moved from one location to another. [Bookshelf\nspeakers](https://www.outeraudio.com/bookshelf-speakers/), or [in-\nwall](https://www.outeraudio.com/in-wall-speakers/) and [in-ceiling\nspeakers](https://www.outeraudio.com/in-ceiling-speakers/) will obviously not\nmake the cut. The problem is that the literal definition of \u201cportability\u201d is\nstill too broad. There are some truly tiny Bluetooth speakers that could fit\nin the palm of your hand, as well as PA systems or tailgate speakers that\nrequire being wheeled around like airport luggage. They may be movable, but\nfor the purpose of this discussion, we\u2019re not considering them as portable.\nHere\u2019s what we think:\n\n**A portable speaker should fit in your hand, or in a backpack or at a\nstretch, would have to go on the seat next to you in your car, but not in the\ntrunk!**\n\nBesides making sure your speakers are actually portable, you\u2019ll also want to\nensure that the speaker you buy has the right design, battery life, range,\naudio quality and durability that you desire if you want to avoid\ndisappointment. And then there\u2019s, of course, the price. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these considerations take. apeek at our Buyers Guide at. the end\nof this article.\n\nTaking the above-mentioned into consideration, here\u2019s our list of the best\nportable speakers with Bluetooth capabilities on the market.\n\n## 1\\.

The JBL Flip 5 is the best\nportable Bluetooth speaker for JBL fans who can\u2019t get enough of their\nproprietary sound signature, and want to take that sound profile on the go\nwith them. If you are on a camping trip, beach day, working outdoors, or\nhaving a small get-together you can\u2019t go wrong with the tried and true JBL\nFlip series, but what\u2019s new with the 5th iteration of the design?\n\nCompared to the Flip 4, the JBL Flip 5 is slightly bigger. This was a decision\nmade by the engineers at JBL to provide the new Flip 5 with a larger battery\nand a slightly bigger sound. The Flip 5 is still waterproof, still has a\nspeakerphone for taking calls, but comes with 4 more watts of output power.\n\nAnother change is that the Flip 5 is not compatible with Connect+ speakers,\nrather the new Flip series speakers will use JBL\u2019s PartyBoost connectivity for\nchaining speakers together. The Flip 5 also comes in more color varieties and\ncharges via a USB-c port.\n\nLike its predecessors, the JBL Flip 5 is a top competitor among portable\nBluetooth speakers, some may even call it the hands-down best portable speaker\nout there. The speaker is fully waterproof, has punchy bass, it\u2019s loud, and it\nhas a great new battery in it that is rated for 12 hours of life. At max\nvolume, you can still get at least 5 hours out of the Flip 5, which is amazing\nfor such a great price!\n\nOverall, I\u2019d say the Flip 5 totally lives up to the Flip family name.\n\nThere are key factors that people expect when they\u2019re buying a portable\nBluetooth speaker, and the Flip 5 hits every checkbox for a better price than\na lot of the competition. The only two criticisms I have are the lack of a\n3.5mm jack and 360 sound capability, but let\u2019s cross our fingers for the Flip\n6!\n\nFor the better part of a decade, JBL has been highly competitive in the\nportable speaker market with the Flip series, and with the Flip 5, they\u2019re\nsure to stay on top for a while longer!\n\n#### Why should you buy the JBL Flip 5?\n\n  * Great Sound Signature\n  * High-Quality Product\n  * Color Options\n\n![The Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n2](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMTUwIDE1MCIgd2lkdGg9IjE1MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxNTAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)\n\n##### **Previously Featured**\n\nThe JBL Flip 5 is an upgrade of the JBL Flip 4 previously featured here. Some\nbelieve the Flip 4, at a slightly lower price, is still a better option.\n\n[ **Check Price**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSYQWNY/?tag=outeraudio-20)\n\n## 2\\.

The OontZ Angle 3 provides\nyou with pretty much everything you could possibly need. The first thing you\nwill notice is that the speaker is pretty small and very light. It is about 5\ninches long and no taller than 3 inches, with a weight of no more than 9\nounces, making it super portable. This allows you to easily carry it around or\nsimply put in your backpack or handbag.\n\nDon\u2019t let the small size fool you though, the sound that is produced by the\nOontZ Angle 3 is absolutely remarkable for such a small speaker.

Cambridge SoundWorks claims that\nthe OontZ Angle 3 forms part of the next generation of portable speakers and\nwe have to agree because none of their competitors come close to what they\nhave achieved with this portable speaker.\n\nAs for some of the other aspects of the speaker; it is water-resistant with an\nIPX5 rating which basically means that it is splash-proof, rainproof,\ndustproof, and sand proof. You can also connect to the speaker via Bluetooth\nfrom pretty much any suitable device, or you can use an AUX cable. Thanks to\nthe built-in mic, you also get the convenient hands-free feature which will\nallow you to access your iPhone or Smartphone through voice commands.\n\nIt is hard to find anything bad to say about this particular portable speaker\nsince it truly does look great, feel great, and sound great \u2013 and best of all,\nit is totally affordable.\n\n#### Why should you buy the OontZ Angle 3?\n\n  * Best Budget Option\n  * Great Sound for Its Size\n  * Very Portable\n\n## 3\\.

They constantly release newer better speakers\nthat are available at affordable prices. With these high-quality speakers you\nwould almost expect there to be some kind of catch but that does not seem to\nbe the case. As far as we can see Anker just somehow continue to design\nawesome speakers that they continue to sell at low prices and all the while\nthe company keeps expanding.\n\nThe first thing you want to know about any speaker is if the sound is good.\nTake it from me; the Anker Soundcore 2 produced superior sound with little to\nno distortion at even the highest volumes. While on the subject of volume, the\nSoundcore 2 can go pretty loud despite its small and compact size. When you\nfirst hear the speaker at full volume, you almost want to look around the room\nto see if there is a larger more powerful speaker hiding somewhere that is\nactually responsible for the sound.\n\nThe majority of speaker brands take the contemporary, minimalistic route when\ndesigning their speakers. So, of course, Anker did the same. Give the people\nwhat they want, right? The Anker Soundcore 2 does, in fact, have a very simple\ndesign and I have to say I think that it looks great. The speaker is black\nwith a rectangular shape and has the Anker brand name printed on the grill in\na simple gray classic Anker font.\n\nSo now that we have established that the speaker looks great, the only thing\nleft to add is the fact that it is small and compact so it will easily fit\ninto your purse or backpack which is essential for a portable Bluetooth\nspeaker.\n\nThe Anker Soundcore 2 is a high-quality speaker that has managed to make\nitself a worthy competitor by giving users a feature that some of the other\nportable speakers lack, namely long battery life. The Anker Soundcore 2 gives\nus almost twice as much battery life as some of the other portable speakers\nwith up to 24 hours of playtime.\n\nFeaturing an IPX7 rating, the Anker Soundcore 2 is protected against rain,\ndust, and snow. Its build design features ergonomic controls, smooth clean\ncurves, and is available in 3 colors (black, blue, or red).\n\nAs for the sound, the speaker comprises of 2 x 6W drivers that emit powerful\nbass results with full sound. The clarity and volume are equally impressive\neven at its max Bluetooth connection range of 66ft.\n\nFor a small, high-quality contemporary speaker, with long battery life, the\nAnker Soundcore 2 is a perfect choice. It is probably the best portable\nBluetooth speaker for those hunting for real value for money.\n\n#### Why should you buy the Soundcore 2?\n\n  * Great Value for Money\n  * IPX 7 Waterproof\n  * Good Sound Signature\n\n![The Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n3](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMTUwIDE1MCIgd2lkdGg9IjE1MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxNTAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)\n\n##### **Previously Featured**\n\nThe Anker Soundcore 2 is an upgrade of the Anker Soundcore previously featured\nhere.

Many brands are\nalso choosing to go with cylinder shapes for their portable\n[Bluetooth](https://www.outeraudio.com/bluetooth/) speakers since they often\nproduce 360-degree sound and it makes them easier to hold in your hands. For\nthe hipsters out there, there are some popular brands that have released some\nfunkier designs, but they mostly still maintain the minimalist shape. For\ninstance, look at the hip UE Boom, in comparison to the contemporary [Harman\nKardon](https://www.harmankardon.com/) Esquire Mini.\n\n![UE\nBoom](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgODc3IDUwMCIgd2lkdGg9Ijg3NyIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1MDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)UE\nBoom\n\n![Harman Kardon Esquire\nMini](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNjY3IDUwMCIgd2lkdGg9IjY2NyIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1MDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)Harman\nKardon Esquire Mini\n\nWith competition mounting, many brands seek to distinguish themselves through\nthe designs of their speakers which is why design plays such a large role. If\nyou are young at heart or love to draw attention then some of the more funky\ndesigns should suit your needs. Anyone that is professional or a little bit\nmore conservative or who would feel simply uncomfortable when using something\nthat looks like a toy in public can opt for some of the more modern and sleek\ndesigns. It all comes down to a matter of personal taste and with so many\noptions to choose from this is one category where you probably won\u2019t have to\ncompromise.\n\n![Photive\nHydra](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMzAwIDMwMCIgd2lkdGg9IjMwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIzMDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)\n\n### Durability\n\nNo matter how careful you are when using your portable Bluetooth speaker\noutdoors accidents will inevitably happen. Durability should be an important\nconsideration for all portable speakers, but the more active your lifestyle\nthe biggest the influence this factor will be for you.\n\nFor the occasional hike or hanging out with friends at the beach, you might\nstill be able to get away with a speaker that is only water and maybe dust\nresistant, but for the more adventurous souls, it\u2019s a different matter.\nAdvantages such as being weatherproof and shock resistant become essential if\nyou spend a lot of time outdoors in bad weather or wet conditions. Sometimes\nthe extra durability comes with an inflated price tag, but you also get\nproducts like the [Photive\nHydra](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K589F8A/?tag=outeraudio-20) that can take\na few knocks without your wallet having to get involved in the beating as\nwell.\n\n### Size & Weight\n\n![Pocket Sized Anker Wireless Bluetooth\nSpeaker](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMzAwIDMwMCIgd2lkdGg9IjMwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIzMDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)\n\nEven in the portable Bluetooth speaker market, you will find that there are\nmarketable size differences between different brands. Obviously, you want\nsomething that is small enough to carry around and ideally fit in your pocket,\nbut not at the cost of inferior audio quality.\n\nIf you absolutely cannot live without thumping bass then you had better be\nprepared to lug around a bit more weight with you as the smaller speakers tend\nto be a bit lacking when it comes to the low-end of the audio spectrum.\nLightweight speakers can offer good sound quality as the Pocket-Sized Anker\nWireless Bluetooth Speaker have demonstrated, but compare it to something like\nthe Amazon Tap and you will hear the difference. If you don\u2019t mind sacrificing\na bit of audio quality for the convenience of carrying a lighter load you\u2019ll\nfind plenty of speakers, like those from Anker to choose from.\n\n### Battery Life\n\nAbout the only thing worse than carrying around a heavy portable speaker that\ndoesn\u2019t sound that great is carrying around a heavy portable speaker with a\nflat battery. If all you ever do is go for a walk in the park or lounge around\nin the backyard by [the pool](https://www.outeraudio.com/best-waterproof-\nfloating-pool-speakers/) you can still get away with a portable speaker that\nhas a shorter battery life. Anything that takes you further from home, and\nmore importantly the battery charger is going to require a portable speaker\nthat can keep going for a while.\n\nThe companies that try and sell you these speakers often have very optimistic\nestimates in their product descriptions and these don\u2019t always match what you\nwill get in real-life. Be prepared to get a much shorter battery life than the\nproduct description if you are prone to using your portable speaker at the top\nvolume all of the time. If extended camping trips in the wilderness are your\nthing something like the Eton Rugged Rukus All-Terrain Portable Solar Wireless\nSound System which can be recharged with solar power might be the only\nsolution for you. Just bear in mind portable speakers are not of much use if\nyour actual audio playback device, be it a smartphone, tablet or laptop runs\nout of juice so make sure you have something that can keep up with your\nspeaker.\n\n### Sound Quality\n\nDepending on how much of an audiophile you are, sound quality should be at the\ntop of your list when it comes to portable Bluetooth speakers. Let\u2019s face it;\nyou are going to find speakers that sound like an AM radio station playing in\nmono. This is why it is so important to test the speakers yourself or listen\nto the good advice from reputable websites. Product reviews from other\nconsumers should also give you a good pretty good indication about the audio\nquality, but bear in mind that tastes differ and something that sounds\nhorrible to one person might sound like a heavenly symphony to someone else.\n\nMany portable speakers inevitably sacrifice some audio quality in order to\npack all those components into a portable casing, but this doesn\u2019t mean you\nhave to settle for something that sounds like a payphone during playback. For\nthe best sound quality, especially when it comes to bass you might have to dig\na little deeper into your wallet and prepare yourself for some extra weight,\nbut in the end, it is worth it.\n\n### Extras\n\nIf all you want is a piece of plastic that plays music and doesn\u2019t really care\nfor much else you can probably overlook the extras. More discerning buyers, on\nthe other hand, will want to get as much value for money when it comes to\ntheir portable Bluetooth speakers. If you are the outdoors type that prefers\nto move around by means other than your own two legs you might want a speaker\nthat can be clipped to the handlebars of your bike or backpack. Some speakers\noffer this feature as standard while others require a separate purchase for\naccessories.\n\nFor example, the Pyle PWPBT60 Sound Box Splash has an integrated metal loop to\nhang it off anything, while if customization is your thing, you might like the\nBose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II with their soft covers or something\nfrom Jawbone that can be upgraded with new features or apps.\n\nThe types of ports and jacks included on the speaker are also quite important\nunless you plan on sticking exclusively to Bluetooth usage. Some portable\nspeakers include microphones so you can answer your phone via the speaker\nwhile others forego this option. Don\u2019t pay through your nose for extras that\nyou will never use, but don\u2019t compromise on a speaker that can\u2019t offer you\neverything you want either.\n\n### Range\n\nThe final thing to consider when it comes to portable Bluetooth speakers is\nthe range. Obviously, you are not going to leave your expensive speaker in the\nmiddle of nowhere and go wandering around, but neither do you want something\nthat has to be tethered to your phone in order to work correctly. The ideal\nportable speaker will give you some breathing room to move about without\nlosing the connection. The further the range of the speaker the better, but\nthere\u2019s no need to go overboard and pay extra for a speaker that can continue\nplaying even when you are too far away to hear it.\n\n## Summary\n\nTo recap on the above-mentioned speakers, and to help you choose between the\nprovided options; here is a quick table summary that compares the various\nfeatures of each speaker to help you pick the perfect speaker for you.\n\n## The Best Portable Bluetooth Speakers\n\nSpeaker| Range| Water Resistance| Price| Ranking  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n[OontZ Angle 3](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/cambridge-oontz-angle3)|\n30ft| IPX5| $| 4.4  \n[DOSS Touch](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/doss-touch)| 33ft| None| $|\n4.4  \n[JBL Flip 4](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/jbl-flip-4)| 30ft| IPX7| $$|\n4.6  \n[Bose SoundLink Mini II](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/bose-soundlink-\nmini-ii)| 30ft| None| $$$| 4.5  \n[Anker Sound Core 2](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/anker-cassic)| 66ft|\nIPX5| $| 4.4  \n[Photive Hydra 2](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/photive-hydra-portable)|\n30ft| IPX7| $| 4.4  \n[UE BOOM](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/ue-boom)| 50ft| IPX4| $$$| 4.4  \n[Etekcity RoverBeats T3](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/etekcity-\nroverbeats-t3)| 33ft| None| $| 4.4  \n[AYL Portable Speaker](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/ayl-portable-\nspeaker-outdoor-shower)| 33ft| IPX5| $| 4.5  \n[Photive M90](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/photive-m90)| 33ft| IPX5| $$|\n4.6  \n[Bose SoundLink Color](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/bose-soundlink-\ncolor)| 30ft| None| $$$| 4.5  \n[Anker SoundCore](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/anker-soundcore-\nbluetooth-speaker)| 66ft| IPX5| $| 4.6  \n[Sony XB10](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/sony-xb10)| 33ft| IPX5| $$| 4.4  \n[Big MagicBox](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/big-magicbox)| 33ft| None|\n$| 4.5  \n[APIE Speaker](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/apie-portable-wireless-\nbluetooth-speaker)| 33ft| IPX6| $| 4.6  \n[Bose SoundLink Revolve+](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/bose-soundlink-\nrevolve-plus)| 30ft| IPX4| $$$$| 4.5  \n[Anker Premium](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/anker-premium-stereo-\nbluetooth-speaker)| 33ft| None| $$| 4.3  \n[JBL Flip 3](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/jbl-flip-3-potrtable)| 30ft|\nIPX5| $$| 4.4  \n[UE ROLL 2 Volcano](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/ue-roll-2)| 65ft| IPX7|\n$$| 4.4  \n[Amazon Tap](https://www.outeraudio.com/go/amzn/amazon-tap)| 50ft| None| $$$|\n4.2  \n  \n## Conclusion\n\nConsumers really are spoiled for choice when it comes to portable Bluetooth\nspeakers so you can afford to be picky when it comes to picking yours.\nRemember it is something that you will be using in public so the more\ncomfortable you are with what you buy the better. It is easy to be swayed by\nsome of the funky designs that are available, but remember that there is more\nto a good speaker than just a pretty box so take the time to examine all the\nfactors that I mentioned in this guide and then make your decision. Making a\nlist of features and factors that are important to you when it comes to\nportable audio will allow you to narrow down your list and make an informed\npurchasing decision.\n\n## ![The Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n1](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjAwIDEyOSIgd2lkdGg9IjIwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMjkiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)  \n[OontZ Angle 3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073BVWRSP/?tag=outeraudio-20)\n\nDon\u2019t let its small size fool you, the sound produced by the OontZ Angle 3 is\nabsolutely remarkable for such a small speaker.
