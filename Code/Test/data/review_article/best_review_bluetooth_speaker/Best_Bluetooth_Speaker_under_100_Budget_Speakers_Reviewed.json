Well, for a start, you can lose nothing by becoming a more educated\nbuyer. Second, we need to set up some standards we\u2019ll use to tear these boys\napart.\n\nHere are the top four things to consider when buying your Bluetooth unit.\n\n###  **Size and weight**\n\nThe main perk of Bluetooth speakers lies in their portability. Sure, the\nabsence of pesky cables comes in a close second place.\n\nBut, what is the first thing that crosses your mind when you think about\nBluetooth speakers \u2013 some hulking wireless beast that can blow the roof off\nyour room or a portable piece of tech you can easily slip into any backpack?\n\nYeah, I thought of the latter mention as well.\n\nSo, keeping that in mind, we can say the good affordable speakers that cover\nmost of the primary user needs should feature manageable measures.\n\nJust how manageable?\n\nWell, even if we take into consideration the \"heavy-duty\" nature of this price\nrange, we can say that Bluetooth units under $100 should be no larger than 13\nx 7 x 5 inches and weigh no more than 5 pounds.\n\n###  **Battery life**\n\nSo, we\u2019ve established that the main purpose of Bluetooth speakers is to be\noutgoing. In order to achieve that, they don\u2019t only need to be portable enough\nto be easily carried around.\n\nOh no, they also need to pack enough juice to allow comfortable autonomy. As\nyou can guess, this critical feature mostly boils down to the capacity of the\nbattery.\n\nBut, just how much battery life is enough? Well, it really depends on a\nvariety of factors that can be broadly described as your personal needs.\n\nStill, if we take a look at the average number of hours offered by the\nspeakers in this range, we can mark 12 as some standard you shouldn't drop\nbelow unless your needs are very modest.\n\n###  **Sound quality and power**\n\nAlthough these two things are closely related, they don\u2019t automatically imply\neach other.\n\nNamely, higher power enables stronger output and, therefore, affects the sound\nquality.  \n  \nThis important feature is measured and described in Watts and, as you can\nguess, the more you get it, the better. Keep in mind, though, that stronger\npower draw has an influence on battery life as well.\n\nSo, the power definitely has an influence on the output quality.\n\nHowever, the ultimate sound quality is also largely affected by the following\nspecs:\n\n  *  **Audio accuracy** \u2013 Essentially, audio accuracy is the ability of the speaker to reproduce audio recording as close as possible.   \nLower quality speakers have a nasty habit of dropping all the nuances of\ncomplicated tunes and turned them into a jumbled mess than only vaguely\nrepresents the original song.  \n  \n\n  *  **Frequency range** \u2013 All the sounds that can be heard by humans (and the ones who don't) can be placed somewhere on the frequency spectrum.   \nThe broader part of this spectrum your speaker can play, the better. Pay\nspecial attention to the lower end that allows the reproduction of deep bass\nlines.  \n  \n\n  *  **360-degree output \u2013** To put it simply, the speakers that point the sound only in one direction need more power to fill in the room with sound. Their performance suffers even more in the open.   \nOn the other hand, the speakers who disperse the sound in multiple directions\n(preferably 360 degrees) handle this issue much better.\n\n###  **Water resistance**\n\nLooking at all the specs, we have previously covered, we can see that a lot of\nspeakers than can be found in the $50 - $100 range are real workhorses that\nare intended for open spaces and outdoor use.\n\nBecause of that, you should look for at least a certain degree of water and\ndust proofing. Fortunately, most of the speakers I'll cover in a minute are at\nleast splash-proof, which means they can survive a tamed pool party.\n\nBut, if you want to get the best level of enjoyment, you should look for\ndevices that feature a full-blown IPX7 that allows immersion up to one meter\nof water and for as long as 30 minutes.\n\n##  **Best Bluetooth speakers under $100**\n\nAnd now, when you know what makes a good speaker, it is time to take a look at\nsome of the best quality and most popular units currently floating the market.\n\nHere are some of the best Bluetooth speakers under 100 dollars.\n\n## **1\\. \u200b Bose SoundLink Micro  \n**\n\n![best Bluetooth speaker under 100 - Bose SoundLink\nMicro](https://www.pinnaclespeakers.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/71yqkmEkGzL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)\n\n\u200b **Our Rating: 93/100**\n\n _[Check Latest\nPrice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748N1BZD?tag=pinnaclespeakers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Latest Price\")_\n\nBose is a pristine name in the world of audio equipment. And although their\nbread and butter lie more in the field of smart homes and home theaters, their\noffer of affordable speakers is more than competitive.\n\nHowever, the brand name has never been a guarantee of quality.\n\nLet us see has the manufacturer found a formula to make their products\naccessible to average consumers while preserving the quality that made the\ncompany famous.\n\n###  **The design**\n\nAt first glance, Bose SoundLink Micro looks horribly uninspired. The unit is\nmade from dark plastic, features relatively modest dimensions of 1.4 x 3.9 x\n3.9 inches, and features no visible standout features whatsoever.\n\nBut, if you take a moment, you will see there is a lot of beauty to be found\nin this simplicity. And the resulting ergonomics of the product is simply\nawesome.\n\nYou want to ride a bike? Just strap the speaker on the handlebar, and you're\ngood to go. Going hiking? The speaker can be mounted on a backpack just as\neasily.\n\nThis situation is largely helped by the fact that the device features IPX7\nthat makes sure you'll be able to blast your tunes even if you are caught in\nthe middle of a blizzard.\n\nThe only downside of these design choices is that the battery that can be\nfound in the unit is very compact as well, which means you will get a below-\naverage autonomy of 6 hours.\n\n### **The performance**\n\nFortunately, in terms of performance, the unit easily rises to the\nexpectations I had from a manufacturer like Bose.\n\nNamely, the output you are going to squeeze out of this piece of plastic is\nincredibly loud for the unit\u2019s size, and all the tones across the frequency\nrange are played with crispness and precision while the bass lines were deep\nand booming.\n\nOverall, I was pretty impressed by how the speaker handled the wide variety of\ngenres ranging from hip hop to speed metal.\n\nBut, that\u2019s not all - SoundLink Micro also features a built-in microphone.\nThat means you will be able to use all the assistance from Google and Siri\nwithout having to pull out your phone. Now that\u2019s neat.\n\nWhat to say, check this product while it\u2019s still hot.\n\n### **Pros**\n\n  * \u200bSturdy build  \n\n  * Excellent ergonomics\n  * Very loud for its size\n  * Built-in microphone\n\n### **Cons**\n\n  * Not the most affordable product on the market\n  * Limited battery life\n\n_[Check Latest\nPrice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748N1BZD?tag=pinnaclespeakers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Latest Price\")_\n\n## **2\\. \u200bBugani M83 Outdoor Speakers Bluetooth 5.0  \n**\n\n![best Bluetooth speaker under 100 - Bugani Bluetooth\nspeakers](https://www.pinnaclespeakers.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/719VZWKup-L._AC_SL1500_.jpg)\n\n\u200b **Our Rating: 90/100**\n\n _[Check Latest\nPrice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LBPWM5Y?tag=pinnaclespeakers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Latest Price\")_\n\nBugani is far from being considered a top-tier audio-equipment manufacturer.\nBut, the beauty of these affordable price ranges is that you don\u2019t truly need\nto be one to put out a good product.\n\nWell, it seems that Bugani has managed to find that secret formula and\nassemble a unit that will provide you hours of fun without breaking your bank.\n\nThis bad boy barely passes the $50 mark.\n\n###  **The design**\n\nOk, let\u2019s cut the small talk and address the obvious elephant in the room\nhere. With its **quality materials and shock-absorbing housing** , Bugani M83\nis tough as nails.\n\nHowever, its design is hugely divisive. Seriously. Some people will dig the\nwhole **black and orange 80s toolbox vibe**. Others will find it so off-\nputting they'll simply skip the speakers in spite of the reliable performance.\n\nSo, in spite of all the goodwill, I'll count this as a drawback.\n\nBut, once you pass this issue, you can see that features a very powerful\n**40W-powered setup** that consists of two woofers and two tweeters.\n\nEven better, the battery you can find inside is not only capable of running\nthis setup. **If you keep the volume at 50%, you will be able to squeeze a\nwhole 40 hours of uninterrupted performance**.\n\nNearly two days of your favorite tunes!\n\nSure, recharge takes sweet 5 hours, but the very idea of blasting such a\npowerful sound outdoors for so long is still very novel. And then there is the\nwhole slew of connectivity options.\n\nThere is one thing I would like to see improved, though \u2013 the unit features\nonly the IPX5 waterproof certification.\n\n###  **The performance**\n\nAs you would expect, such a layered set up as the one we can find here should\nprovide **very reliable and precise** performance. And, in spite of the modest\nprice we can find on the box, the overall impression is, indeed, very solid.\n\nI tested the speakers with all sorts of different genres ranging from jazz and\nclassic rock to house, and they all came out more than pleasant. **The area I\nfound the most pleasing was the bass.**\n\nWith two powerful woofers pumping behind the grills, this bad boy puts on the\nlow-frequency performance very hard to match even if you invest a couple of\ndozens of bucks more.\n\nAs a matter of fact, this money will be much better used if you buy the\nspeaker bundled with a handy carrying bag.\n\n### **Pros**\n\n  * \u200bDurable shock-absorbing housing  \n\n  * Versatile speaker setup\n  * Incredibly powerful battery\n  * PX5 waterproof certification\n\n### **Cons**\n\n  * Divisive design\n  * The output could be louder\n\n_[Check Latest\nPrice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LBPWM5Y?tag=pinnaclespeakers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Latest Price\")_\n\n## **3\\. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bJBL FLIP 5 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker  \n**\n\n![best Bluetooth speaker under 100 roundup - JBL FLIP\n5](https://www.pinnaclespeakers.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/81AQKpDB9lL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)\n\n\u200b **Our Rating: 89/100**\n\n _[Check Latest\nPrice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QK2SPP7?tag=pinnaclespeakers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Latest Price\")_\n\nAny kind of list of best Bluetooth speakers simply wouldn\u2019t be the same\nwithout at least one entry coming from JBL\u2019s kitchen. And surprise, surprise -\ntoday we have not one but two speakers carrying this famous brand written over\ntheir body.\n\nLet us first take a look at the newer iteration of the famous FLIP lineup that\nrepresents the pinnacle of all the previous JBL\u2019s efforts.\n\n###  **The design**\n\nIn terms of design, JBL has always been very fond of the \u201c _if it ain't broke,\ndon't fix it_ \u201d philosophy. Therefore, it should be no surprise that FLIP 5\nfollows the same old design language the manufacturer has used time and again.\n\nBottom line, if you love that **bulky, grilled roller body** , this is the\nproduct for you. If you don\u2019t, there are very slight chances something will\nchange in the future.\n\nBut, on the bright side, the body is adamant, good-looking, features\ncomprehensive controls, and is even **resistant to submersion (IPX7\ncertification)** , so there are really not that many things to be frustrated\nabout.\n\nAlso, even if you feel that the design has become a bit tired by now, JBL\nallows you to choose between 11 exciting colors and break the monotony.\n\nI have always seen the whole FLIP series as a perfect pool-party companion, so\nI always leaned toward more vibrant options. This time I bought the red one.\nBoy, does it look energizing.\n\nFinally, much like with any other iteration of the FLIP series, the speaker is\ncapable of **360-degree sound reproduction** , which is just awesome.\n\n###  **The performance**\n\nIn terms of performance, FLIP 5 rises to the high standards set by the\nprevious products from the series. The output is loud, precise, and handles\nall of the tunes you can expect to find at a regular pool party with ease.\n\nThe fact that the thing effortlessly floats in the water and features\nsubstantial autonomy of **12 hours of playtime** just makes the impression\neven better.\n\nHowever, be aware that the speaker plays only mono audio. Sure, you can pair\nthe device with other Connect+-compatible devices to create the stereo setup.\n\nBut, if you don\u2019t own them\u2026 Well, that\u2019s a bummer.\n\n### **Pros**\n\n  * \u200bDurable build  \n\n  * Tried and true design\n  * Strong and precise output\n  * Comprehensive controls\n  * IPX7 certification\n\n### **Cons**\n\n  * Compatible only with the other Connect+ devices\n  * Mono audio\n\n_[Check Latest\nPrice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QK2SPP7?tag=pinnaclespeakers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Latest Price\")_\n\n## **4\\. \u200b\u200bJabra Speak 510 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker  \n**\n\n![](https://www.pinnaclespeakers.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/5112k-ThhsL._AC_.jpg)\n\n\u200b **Our Rating: 88/100**\n\n _[Check Latest\nPrice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AQUO5RI?tag=pinnaclespeakers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Latest Price\")_\n\nAnd now for something completely different. Yes, in the world of buffed up\nBluetooth speakers, Jabra made an interesting choice \u2013 their Speak lineup\nisn\u2019t trying to compete with any of them.\n\nInstead, the manufacturer has decided to position its product as a **business-\noriented series of conference speakers**.\n\nA very wise decision, indeed. But, what does that mean for the overall\nusability of this package?\n\n###  **The design**\n\nCall me crazy, but am I the only one that thinks Speak 510 looks like some\nkind of smart hot plate?\n\nJoking aside, this is what the most conference units look like, and this kind\nof design serves their purpose very well. And if you are willing to go with\nthis whole idea, you\u2019ll notice that the unit **looks rather sleek and it\u2019s\nbeen put together more than well**.\n\nBut, be warned, since the speaker is top oriented, its sound dispersion ( _at\nleast in terms of playing music_ ) is not that great.\n\nSo, what we can find when we take a closer look at the device? Well, the\ncontrols that are spread along the edge of the speaker are visible and\nresponsive.\n\nAlso, the battery that can be found inside is a no joke. With up to **15 hours\nof continuous playback** , Speak 510 can easily stand toe to toe with any\nother unit on the list.\n\nAnd when my battery run dry, I easily hooked up the unit with my PC and\ncontinued playing. So, taking into consideration what this speaker was made\nfor, I am pleased with everything I've seen so far.\n\n###  **The performance**\n\nIf I had to describe Jabra Speak 510 in one word, it would be \"fine.\"\nSeriously, this neat piece of tech is perfectly fine. I played a couple of\nmetal tunes; it performed well. When I switched to rap, bass ended up a bit on\nthe lower side, but the impression remained solid.\n\nBut, all these things are not what the speaker was made for. So, I made a\ncouple of conference calls. _Impressions are as follows:_\n\nThe unit picks up the voice exceptionally well and plays it even better. Also,\nkeeping in mind its purpose, the speaker is very loud. On the downside, the\nmicrophone cuts out when the speaker emits a sound, which is, I suppose,\nsomething you would want from a conference unit.\n\n### **Pros**\n\n  * \u200bGood build quality  \n\n  * The built-in microphone works very well\n  * Sleek design\n  * Seamless USB connectivity\n  * Solid real-life performance\n\n### **Cons**\n\n  * The USB cable is short\n  * The microphone and speaker can\u2019t work simultaneously\n\n_[Check Latest\nPrice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AQUO5RI?tag=pinnaclespeakers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Latest Price\")_\n\n## **5\\. \u200b\u200bJBL Flip 4 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker  \n**\n\n![best Bluetooth speaker under 100 for 2020/20 roundup - JBL Flip\n4](https://www.pinnaclespeakers.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/71dZJTGY4ML._AC_SL1500_.jpg)\n\n\u200b **Our Rating: 86/100**\n\n _[Check Latest\nPrice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSYQWNY?tag=pinnaclespeakers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Latest Price\")_\n\nAs I already mentioned, JBL is a powerhouse manufacturer \u2013 probably the most\nfamous name in the entire affordable Bluetooth speaker market segment. This\nsuccess can be primarily contributed to the insanely popular FLIP series.\n\nYou have already seen what I have to say about its latest iteration, FLIP 5.\nLet's see what happens if we take a step back. This time, we are going to take\na look at FLIP 4.\n\n###  **The design**\n\nSpeaking about the visual appearance and build quality of this unit is very\nhard. I had already said everything that needs to be told when I talked about\nFLIP 5.\n\nBut, for those who came in late, JBL has, by this point, mastered the art of\nroller-shaped speakers wrapped in a tough waterproof fabric, and can produce\nthe unit like this without a second thought.\n\nThe result of this tired practice and years is a product that was able to\nendure all sorts of abuse I put it through and continue working even after a\ncouple of serious submersions in the water (courtesy of IPX7 certification).\n\nOnce again, the speaker features **very intuitive and easy-to-use controls**\nas well as **seamless voice control integration** that make the use of various\nvoice assistants a breeze.\n\nIf we take a look inside, we can find a **battery of 3000mAh** , which allows\na **playback time of approximately 12 hours** , which is on par with the\nbattery life we saw in FLIP 5.\n\n###  **The performance**\n\nIn terms of the performance, JBL FLIP 4 does everything you would expect from\na FLIP series. **The sound reproduction is very precise, frequency range more\nthan satisfying, bass deep, volume high, and the audio mono.**\n\nHowever, the device supports the Connect+ option, so you will be able to\ncreate your stereo setup if you have at least one more of these.\n\nI told you \u2013 a pretty standard affair.\n\nThe main question here is what separates FLIP 5 and FLIP 4 and does going one\nstep back produces large enough savings to make sense.\n\nWell, the main difference between these two products can be found in power \u2013\nFLIP 5 runs on 20W, while FLIP 4 brings these numbers down to 16W. The result\nis noticeably weaker output.\n\nThat power gap comes with the price difference of about 10 to 15 dollars. What\nare you going to take out of this depends entirely up to you.\n\n### **Pros**\n\n  * \u200bSolid performance  \n\n  * Durable build\n  * IPX waterproof certification\n  * Good autonomy\n\n### **Cons**\n\n  * FLIP 5 simply makes a much better purchase\n\n_[Check Latest\nPrice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSYQWNY?tag=pinnaclespeakers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Latest Price\")_\n\n## **6\\. \u200bAOMAIS GO Bluetooth Speakers  \n**\n\n![buying best Bluetooth speaker under 100 in 2020/20 - AOMAIS\nGO](https://www.pinnaclespeakers.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/71oG-M2TVOL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)\n\n\u200b **Our Rating: 83/100**\n\n _[Check Latest\nPrice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071H8MJ99?tag=pinnaclespeakers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Latest Price\")_\n\nIf you thought that Bugani M83 was a niche product, you are forgiven \u2013 I mean,\ntoolbox speakers don\u2019t look like something that will eventually catch on. But,\nit turns out these workhorse devices are pretty popular.\n\nAnd when you think about it a bit, this whole idea makes horribly lot sense.\nHonestly, what would you bring to camping with you \u2013 your fancy JBL roller or\nsomething that looks like it went to hell and back and rocks the music for two\ndays uninterrupted?\n\nYeah, I concur.\n\n###  **The design**\n\nOne of the main problems with AOMAIS GO is that the powerhouse performance\nI\u2019ve talked about is somewhat missing. For instance, the **battery life of\n8800mAh** allows for a pretty comfortable **30 hours of playtime**.\n\nNot bad, but remember - Bugani M83 offers ten hours more and costs a lot less\nthan this piece of tech.\n\nAlso, the speaker setup here is a bit less inspired. This time, you get **dual\n15-Watt full-range drivers paired with two passive radiators**. Not bad, but\nI\u2019ve seen better.\n\nIt is the build quality where this speaker indeed rises to the occasion and\nfinds a way to stand out for the competition.\n\nFirst of all, the device is rock solid and looks like it can take more than a\ncouple of hits before breaking. Second, you get the **IPX7 certification** ,\nwhich means you will be able to play your favorite tunes even if you find\nyourself in the middle of a blizzard.\n\nAnd, as a cream on top, the manufacturer even gave you an option to choose\nbetween **three different color setups**. Overall, not bad.\n\n###  **The performance**\n\nSo, what all these building blocks amount to when you finally put the music\nthrough the speakers?\n\nWell, let\u2019s call it a reasonable performance. Namely, the quality of the\noutput is not that bad. As a matter of fact, classic rock tunes ( _think\nFleetwood Mac_ ) sounded rather nice when turned to eleven.\n\nBut, as soon as I moved to something more bass-heavy, I noticed that bass\nsounds way weaker than I hoped. It's not bad or anything, but for this money,\nyou can get better.\n\nAnd that is probably the main issue I had with this product. On its own \u2013 it\u2019s\nactually quite decent. But, the harsh competition simply makes this purchase\nunadvised.\n\n### **Pros**\n\n  * \u200bThe unit feels tough as nails  \n\n  * Three different color options\n  * Solid battery life\n  * Precise sound reproduction\n  * Lots of different connectivity options\n\n### **Cons**\n\n  * For this money, you can find something better\n  * Underwhelming bass\n\n_[Check Latest\nPrice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071H8MJ99?tag=pinnaclespeakers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Latest Price\")_\n\n## **7\\. \u200bAnker Soundcore Boost Bluetooth Speakers  \n**\n\n![ANKER Bluetooth Speaker under 100](https://www.pinnaclespeakers.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/616UnNkB91L._AC_SL1200_.jpg)\n\n\u200b **Our Rating: 80/100**\n\n _[Check Latest\nPrice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N4V4X5M?tag=pinnaclespeakers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Latest Price\")_\n\nFinally, we have an entry from Anker, the manufacturer that is far from\nunknown but still has a lot of work to do to become a household name in audio\nmarket.\n\nUp until now, the Anker mostly made an impression in the lower mid-range\nmarket segment. This unit is no different \u2013 with the **price tag that's just\nabove 50 dollars** , this unit ought to draw the attention of curious buyers.\n\nBut, is the affordable price enough taking into consideration such a harsh\ncompetition?\n\n###  **The design**\n\nIf you take a quick look at the Anker\u2019s speaker setup, you can easily confuse\nit for a tiny soundbar. And that is perfectly ok. This unit is pretty well put\ntogether, **looks sleek and way beyond its price range**. The connectivity\noptions ( **NFC** included) are also pretty bad-ass.\n\nThis sleekness, however, comes at the slight expense of durability. Also, the\ndevice features only the IPX5 certification, which means more extensive\noutdoor use is out of the question.\n\nToo bad \u2013 I grew very fond of this simplified but effective design language,\nand I wouldn't mind showing it off to my friends more often.\n\nAs for the very components that can be found under the front-facing grill,\nhere we can see **dual drivers packed with twin subwoofers** , which is,\nactually, pretty amazing.\n\nUnfortunately, the battery life is all but. The manufacturer says that the\nspeaker can work for 10 hours. I was barely able to squeeze 9. I really don\u2019t\nknow what to say \u2013 a mixed bag if there ever was one.\n\n###  **The performance**\n\nBut, all the things I mentioned are not that relevant. The most important\nthing is **the audio quality** when you finally start rocking your tunes. And,\nas you can probably guess, the performance you\u2019ll get from this **20W-powered\npiece of tech** is somewhat compromised.\n\nAs long as you keep the speakers below 50% volume, everything is peachy \u2013\nespecially the tight and well-delivered bass lines. But, try going beyond this\nthreshold, and the sound quality will quickly start falling apart.\n\nAll these things don\u2019t make Anker\u2019s latest effort a bad product. I just can\u2019t\nfind a good reason to recommend it amongst the superior competition.\n\n### **Pros**\n\n  * \u200bAffordable  \n\n  * Premium looks & build quality\n  * Strong & potent output\n\n### **Cons**\n\n  * Subpar battery life\n  * Sound falls apart when you turn it up above 50%\n\n_[Check Latest\nPrice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N4V4X5M?tag=pinnaclespeakers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Latest Price\")_\n\n## **After it's all said and done, we recommend:**\n\n![best Bluetooth speaker under 100 - Bose SoundLink\nMicro](https://www.pinnaclespeakers.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/71yqkmEkGzL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)\n\n#####  ** _ ** _ **[ _ **Bose SoundLink\nMicro**_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UFHXNI)**_**_**\n\n###  _ **Why is it better?**_\n\n  * \u200bElegant design  \n\n  * Excellent sound quality\n  * Very loud for its size\n  * Good portability\n  * Built-in microphone\n\n#####  **93/100  \n** **our score**\n\n _[Check Latest\nPrice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748N1BZD?tag=pinnaclespeakers-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Latest Price\")_\n\nWell, we are finally at the end, which means one thing \u2013 it's time to declare\nthe winner of this round-up. And, once again, the competition was very harsh.\nBut, when we take into consideration all the pros and cons, **Bose SoundLink\nMicro** simply stands out as the best-rounded product. Sure, other entries may\nexcel in one area or another, but in terms of portability and overall\nperformance, Bose's entry stands out as an undisputed king of the hill.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Barry Allen](https://www.pinnaclespeakers.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/image.jpg)\n\n#### About the author:\n\n####  **Barry Allen**\n\nI grew up to be a self-proclaimed stuck-up audiophile, and I \u2013 partially \u2013\nblame Pinnacle Speakers for it.\n\n  \n\nThe whole point of me starting this website was to keep the tradition going.\nAlthough the means have changed, the mission remains the same: Bringing\n\u201esterling sound\u201c as they once put it into home theaters and sound systems\nworldwide!\n\n  \n\n### Related posts:\n\n  1.
