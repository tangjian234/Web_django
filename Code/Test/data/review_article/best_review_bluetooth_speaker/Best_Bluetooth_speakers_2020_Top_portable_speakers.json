With added Alexa voice control and waterproofing it's\nclearly superior to the already awesome original.\n\nFor many the elephant in the room will be the Beosound A1 2nd Gen's asking\nprice. No, this isn't a low-cost speaker. But, yes, it most definitely is a\nhigh-quality one that delivers huge sound from a beautifully made package.\n\nIt might be small, but the Beosound A1 2nd Gen packs a big punch that makes it\nworth every penny. We can name no better portable at this scale.\n\n  * [Read our Beosound A1 2nd Gen review](https://www.pocket-lint.com/speakers/reviews/bang-and-olufsen/152302-beosound-a1-2nd-gen-review-bang-olufsen-portable-bluetooth)\n  * [Best Bang & Olufsen speaker: Which B&O is right for you?](https://www.pocket-lint.com/speakers/buyers-guides/140759-best-bang-and-olufsen-speakers)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n## Ultimate Ears Megaboom 3\n\nsquirrel_widget_145462\n\nThe UE Megaboom is a standout product; one only really limited by the high\nprice point. But even the high price can't muddy the raft of good points that\nsee it swim along - literally if you dunk it in the bath, thanks to\nwaterproofing and floatability.\n\nThis bass-booming cylinder sounds great (with even better bass than before),\nlooks great, and is tough enough to tackle music in the office, for that\nsummer picnic or festival, or whatever else you happen to throw at it. It's\nBluetooth speaker bliss.\n\n  * [Ultimate Ears UE Megaboom 3 review](/speakers/reviews/ultimate-ears/145462-ultimate-ears-ue-megaboom-3-review-speaker-portable-bluetooth)\n  * [Which UE speaker is right for you?](/speakers/buyers-guides/ultimate-ears/145633-which-ue-speaker-is-best-megablast-blast-megaboom-boom-and-wonderboom-compared)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n## Marshall Stockwell II\n\nsquirrel_widget_148684\n\nIt's not a party speaker - we'll leave that to the bigger [Kilburn II\n(featured below)](/speakers/reviews/145667-marshall-kilburn-2-review-ii-\nspeaker) and larger-than-life Tufton - but this is a super-portable unit that\nprovides you with powerful audio on the go.\n\nIt's ideal for camping and picnics (both tried and tested by us). It probably\nisn't going to be your main speaker at home - though it's totally capable of\nbeing that if you so require.\n\nAs well as the standard Marshall bass, treble and volume controls, there's\nalso a battery level indicator too. You'll get well over 20 hours of listening\ntime out of it. Indeed, you'll try hard to remember the last time you had to\ncharge it.\n\n  * [Marshall Stockwell II review](/speakers/reviews/147953-marshall-stockwell-ii-review)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n## Sonos Move\n\nsquirrel_widget_167282\n\nThe Sonos Move is both a Bluetooth speaker and a Wi-Fi speaker - offering a\ntoggle on the rear to switch between the two modes. In Wi-Fi mode, it connects\nto other Sonos speakers for a multi-room audio experience, while in Bluetooth\nmode, it delivers a fantastic sound experience with plenty of bass and a\ndurable and water-resistant design. It will also automatically tune itself to\nits surroundings.\n\nIt's not cheap by any stretch of the imagination and it's weighty too, which\nmeans while it is portable - there's an integrated handle on the back - it's\nnot the kind of device you can pop in your backpack for a picnic. That said,\nif you take it to the park or the beach, its sound and volume will impress (or\ndistress) most around you.\n\nIt's a great option for those with a Sonos system, offering the best of both\nworlds - an excellent Wi-Fi smart speaker with AirPlay 2 support that you can\nmove around as you please.\n\n  * [Sonos Move review](/speakers/reviews/sonos/149201-sonos-move-review-portable-bluetooth-speaker)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n## B&O BeoPlay A1\n\nsquirrel_widget_138348\n\nWith a slightly different name to the more recent 2nd Gen \"Beosound A2\" (which\nreplaces this device), the BeoPlay A1 is a savvy option if you can find it for\na bargain price. Like the A2 its big sound makes it stand out.\n\nSure, there's no Wi-Fi, [AirPlay](/speakers/news/apple/141261-apple-\nairplay-2-what-is-it-how-does-it-work-and-what-devices-are-supported),\nwaterproofing or 360-degree design like some of its competitors, but the solid\nbattery, build quality, extra bass punch and sheer audio clarity give this\nspeaker the upper hand when it comes to sound quality. It's well worth saving\nup to buy.\n\n  * [B&O BeoPlay A1 by Bang & Olufsen review](/speakers/reviews/bang-and-olufsen/138348-b-o-beoplay-a1-by-bang-and-olufsen-review-bluetooth-speaker-bliss)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n## Ultimate Ears Boom 3\n\nsquirrel_widget_148748\n\nThe [UE Boom 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014M909NC/?tag=pocketlintc07-20)\nwas excellent - it took taking one of our favourite portable Bluetooth\nspeakers, the original UE Boom, and made it even better - but the Boom 3 takes\nthis up a notch, while delivering a lower asking price.\n\nIf you're looking for portable, premium sound wherever you are, then the UE\nBoom 3 hits the nail on the head. Have reasonable expectations for bass\ndelivery and it's one seriously hot Bluetooth speaker. If you want even more\nthen the Megaboom 3 (featured up page) is a beefed up version.\n\n  * [Ultimate Ears UE Boom 3 review](/speakers/reviews/ultimate-ears/145473-ultimate-ears-ue-boom-3-review)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n## Marshall Kilburn II\n\nsquirrel_widget_145667\n\nThe beauty of the powerful Kilburn II is its simplicity and portability. The\nKilburn II is truly a wall of sound; a bass blaster that turns it up to 10\n(not 11, sorry). Mind you, if you get up to anything like that volume level\nyou'll be doing well to still be next to it.\n\nWe have listened to cleaner-sounding models and if you need 360-degree sound\nthen plump for the UE Megaboom 3 instead. Battery life is impressive at around\n20 hours though and naturally, being a Marshall product, the whole speaker has\na very distinctive look and feel.\n\n  * [Marshall Kilburn II review](/speakers/reviews/145667-marshall-kilburn-2-review-ii-speaker)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n## Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 2\n\nsquirrel_widget_148842\n\nIf you want to invest in UE's range of portable Bluetooth speakers, but want\nsomething smaller than the Boom or Megaboom, the Wonderboom is the one for\nyou.\n\nWhen you turn it on, prepare yourself for an explosion of 360-degree sound\nthat belies its size. It's palm-sized, and like other speakers in the range,\nis protected against knocks, bumps, drops and splashes thanks to its\nrubberised casing and IP67 rating.\n\nIt can float too, so you can comfortably take it in the pool with you. What's\nmore, several colours are available - black, grey, red, blue and pink. It can\ntackle all genres of music with aplomb and will add life to any social\nscenario. You can even stereo pair two together.\n\n  * [Ultimate Ears UE Wonderboom 2 review](/speakers/reviews/ultimate-ears/148230-ultimate-ears-wonderboom-2-review)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n## BeoPlay P6\n\nsquirrel_widget_145767\n\nDelivering sensational sound, there's lots to like about the P6 including its\nbeautiful sound quality and pleasant-to-use physical controls. It's also dust\nand splash-proof and has a rechargeable battery that lasts a thoroughly decent\n16 hours.\n\nThe only real disadvantage is the high asking price (which has come down a\nbit) and you may want to look at the cheaper A1, above. There's also no 3.5mm\nauxiliary input, either, which is a little disappointing.\n\n  * [BeoPlay P6 review](/speakers/reviews/bang-and-olufsen/145767-beoplay-p6-review-speaker-bluetooth)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n## JBL Xtreme 2\n\nsquirrel_widget_145677\n\nThis larger-scale portable speaker delivers loud and crisp sound, and even\nthough it doesn't have 360-degree sound it'll give you some pretty impressive\nbass from the dual woofers.\n\nIt's undoubtedly a party speaker and also features a large carry handle plus\nit's IPX7 water-resistant as well. There are only two disadvantages - a\nreasonably hefty price point for one, along with physical heft owed to the\nscale.\n\n  * [JBL Xtreme 2 review](/speakers/reviews/jbl/145677-jbl-xtreme-2-review-portable-bluetooth-speaker)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n## Denon Envaya DSB-250\n\nsquirrel_widget_143188\n\nDenon is a well-known name from the world of Hi-Fi. And true to these roots,\nEnvaya is a great-sounding speaker that balances fidelity and power. In fact,\nwe'd go as far as to say it's one of the best-sounding small wireless speakers\naround.\n\nBy the way, Denon has three models available, the 250BT being the largest and\nnaturally the beefiest. The Envaya Mini (150BT) and Envaya Pocket (50BT) slot\nin underneath. The DSB-250 is semi-rugged, with [IP67 water\nresistance](/phones/news/138727-ip-ratings-what-do-they-actually-mean). It can\nhandle being submerged in water a metre deep for half an hour.\n\n  * [Denon Envaya DSB-250 review](/speakers/reviews/denon/143188-denon-envaya-dsb-250-review-sensational-sound-from-this-small-scale-portable-bluetooth-speaker)\n\nSections [Denon](/denon) [Sonos](/sonos) [JBL](/jbl) [Bang & Olufsen](/bang-\nand-olufsen) [Ultimate Ears](/ultimate-ears) [Pure](/pure)\n[Speakers](/speakers)\n\n[Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/shop/pocketlint)\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/pocketlintcom)\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pocketlintcom/)\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pocketlintcom/)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Pocketlint)\n[PodCast](https://shows.pippa.io/pocket-lint-podcast/)\n\nsearch\n\n  * [Pocket-lint Gadget Awards](/awards)\n  * [RSS Feeds](/info/rss)\n  * [Newsletter](/info/newsletter)\n  * [Podcast](https://shows.pippa.io/pocket-lint-podcast/)\n\n  * Popular sections:\n  * [Phones](/phones)\n  * [Apps](/apps)\n  * [TV](/tv)\n  * [Smart home](/smart-home)\n  * [Games](/games)\n  * [Tablets](/tablets)\n  * [Laptops](/laptops)\n  * [Speakers](/speakers)\n  * [Cameras](/cameras)\n  * [Smartwatches](/smartwatches)\n\n  * [Site map](/info/sitemap)\n  * [Contact us](/info/contact-us)\n  * [About Pocket-lint](/info/authors)\n  * [Sustainability](/info/sustainability)\n  * [Editorial Standards](/info/editorial-standards)\n  * [Terms of Use](/info/terms)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/info/policies)\n  * [Advertise on Pocket-lint](/info/advertise-on-pocket-lint)\n  * Privacy Settings\n\n2003 - 2020 \u00a9 Pocket-lint Limited PO Box 4770, Ascot, SL5 5DP.
