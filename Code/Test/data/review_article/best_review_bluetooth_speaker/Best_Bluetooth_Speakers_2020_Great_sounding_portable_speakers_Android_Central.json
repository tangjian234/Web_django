For a fraction of the\nprice of the other Bluetooth speakers, Anker's latest packs respectable sound\nand all-day battery life into a small, rugged chassis. The Soundcore 2 is\nwaterproof and rated to last for a full 24 hours. Of course, you'd hope Anker\nof all brands would be able to provide good battery life.\n\nUnfortunately, the Soundcore 2 is significantly lacking in bass, which can\nhave a significant impact on specific genres of music, and it's a bit quiet\ncompared to other speakers on this list. Still, for the price it commands,\nit's a great little speaker available in a few color options, and you can even\nbuy more than one and pair them together for surround sound audio.\n\n### Pros:\n\n  * IPX7 water resistance\n  * Stereo pairing with other Soundcores\n  * Fantastic battery life\n  * Extremely affordable speaker\n\n### Cons:\n\n  * Lacking in bass\n  * Not as loud as other speakers\n\n### Best Battery Life\n\n[\n![](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/2x1.png)![](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/small/public/article_images/2019/10/anker-\nsoundcore-2-black-official-render.jpg)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTB55WH/?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU54067YYw)\n\n####  [Anker Soundcore\n2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTB55WH/?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU54067YYw)\n\nSmall and affordable\n\nThe Soundcore 2 has water resistance and long battery life.

It offers everything from good looks and\ngreat sound to water resistance, long-lasting battery life, and bold color\noptions.\n\nThe Megaboom 3 features UE's iconic cylindrical shape and soft-touch fabric,\nalong with two large buttons along with the casing for adjusting the volume up\nand down. The rubberized flap near the bottom of the speaker hides a Micro-USB\nport (sadly, no USB-C), and there's a fabric loop at the top for clipping the\nMegaboom 3 to a carabiner \u2014 perfect for carrying attached to your backpack.\n\nIt's a bit on the larger side, but the Megaboom 3's stature allows for\nfantastic, booming audio with just the right amount of bass. This is one of\nthe best-sounding speakers on the list, and the shape of the speaker allows\nfor 360-degree sound so that everyone in the area hears the same great audio.\nBest of all, you can link multiple Boom speakers together to play the same\nmusic throughout the house \u2014 as many as 150 speakers at once.\n\nYou won't have to worry about the Megaboom 3 running out of juice halfway\nthrough a party either since it's rated for up to 20 hours of playback on a\nsingle charge.

Still, it sounds even\nbetter, with a clearer high end and punchier bass that Bose is known for. The\naluminum unibody design is pretty slick, too \u2014 but it's only IPX4 splash\nresistant, rather than IP67 like the Megaboom 3.\n\nThe SoundLink's most significant disadvantage is its price, which is 50% more\nthan the Megaboom 3. Still, that could be worth it for audiophiles and fans of\nBose's legendary sound signature. It also has long battery life, coming in at\naround 16 hours per charge, and the handle at the top makes it easy to pick up\nand carry around once the party moves locations.\n\n### Pros:\n\n  * Sleek aluminum design\n  * Bose reputation\n  * IPX4 splash-proof\n  * Handle up top for easy transport\n  * Great battery life\n  * Omnidirectional audio\n\n### Cons:\n\n  * Significantly pricier than Megaboom 3\n  * Charges over Micro-USB\n\n### Best Audio Quality\n\n[\n![](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/1x2.png)![](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/small/public/article_images/2020/03/bose-\nsoundlink-revolve-plus-official-render.png)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCW4VFS/?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU54067YYw)\n\n####  [Bose SoundLink\nRevolve+](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCW4VFS/?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU54067YYw)\n\nThe pricier, better-sounding Megaboom 3 alternative\n\nThe Revolve+ is one of the best-sounding Bluetooth speakers around, and its\naluminum enclosure is sleek and splash-resistant.\n\n  * [$299 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCW4VFS/?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU54067YYw)\n  * [$350 at Best Buy](/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU54067YYw%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fbose-portable-home-speaker-with-built-in-wifi-bluetooth-google-assistant-and-alexa-voice-control-luxe-silver%252F6370824.p%253FskuId%253D6370824%26ourl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fbose-portable-home-speaker-with-built-in-wifi-bluetooth-google-assistant-and-alexa-voice-control-luxe-silver%252F6370824.p&token=KpyPP4b0)\n  * [$299 at Walmart](/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F612734%2F9383%3Fsharedid%3D159229%26subId1%3DUUacUdUnU54067YYw%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FBose-SoundLink-Revolve-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker-Black%252F837117591&token=sgLJKRBk)\n\n## Best-Looking Speaker: _V-Moda Remix_\n\n![v moda remix and\nheadphones](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/4x3.png)![v\nmoda remix and\nheadphones](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/07/v-moda-\nremix-lifestyle.jpg?itok=Unmio87Z)_Source: V-Moda_\n\nV-Moda is typically known for its high-end headphones, but the Remix impresses\nwith a unique, stunning design and modern appointments like USB-C.

If you're looking for that level of toughness, then look\nno further than the Tronsmart Force Bluetooth speaker.\n\nThis is the kind of speaker you can feel comfortable bringing with you on your\nnext pool party or beach vacation, but it is equally at home in the home. It\npairs quickly and easily to your devices via NFC, and even though the battery\nlife isn't as long as we'd like, you can charge it efficiently via its USB-C\ncharging port.

The standard is ubiquitous, with every phone,\ntablet, and notebook featuring Bluetooth connectivity. While some of the\noptions listed above feature Bluetooth 4.0 and several others are based on\nBluetooth 4.2, you won't notice any difference when it comes to connecting\nyour phone or tablet to any of the picks we've outlined.\n\nBluetooth speakers have come a long way in the last five years, with even\nbudget options offering great sound quality these days. They're ideal for\nlistening to music or your favorite podcasts at home or near the pool. You\ndon't have to worry about range either, with all of the options mentioned\nabove delivering rock-solid connectivity up to 50 feet. There are several on\nthe list that go up to 100 feet or beyond, with Ultimate Ears leading the\ncharge in this particular area.\n\nOne of the main reasons for going with a Bluetooth speaker is that you don't\nneed to worry about wires, and there's no specialized hardware required to\nconnect to one. Portability is also a primary factor here, as it's easy to\ncarry most of the picks we've listed above in your bag.\n\n## How to pick the best Bluetooth speaker for you\n\nWith a seemingly unending selection of Bluetooth speakers, it can be\nchallenging to decide where to start. These devices vary wildly by price, by\ndesign, by feature set, by sound quality, and more. Before you decide on a\nBluetooth speaker, here are some factors to consider:\n\n**1\\. Indoors or outdoors?**\n\nWhile many of the Bluetooth speakers on this list can function equally well\nboth inside and out, some are _tuned_ to work better in one environment over\nthe other.\n\nFor example, the Marshall Stanmore II or V-Moda Remix are both fantastic\nadditions to your living room or office, but you probably don't want to leave\nthem outside for hours at a time. Alternatively, something like the Tronsmart\nForce or Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 2 are outstanding for outdoor use, but if\nyou're primarily going to be listening inside, you can probably find better\noptions.\n\n**2\\. Price**\n\nBluetooth speaker pricing runs the gamut from bargains buys to premium\naudiophile halo products. Generally speaking, the more you spend, the more\nfeatures are included, and the better the speaker(s) sounds. But that doesn't\nmean that you can't find a good balance of features for a good value. True,\none of our absolute favorite speakers (of any kind) is the Bose SoundLink\nRevolve+, but just about any offering from JBL or Ultimate Ears should make\nmost ears happy.\n\n**3\\. Size matters**\n\nGet your mind out of the gutter; I'm talking speaker size here. If you want\nsomething portable for a mountain bike ride or commute, then you're not going\nto want to get anything much larger than the Bose SoundLink Micro or Sony SRS-\nXB12. However, if you're going to host an epic BBQ or dance party, the much\nlarger Bose SoundLink Revolve+ or Marshall Stanmore II might be more fitting.\n\n**4\\. Battery life and charging capacity**\n\nIf you're taking your Bluetooth speaker away from a steady power source, you\nwant to be sure that it can last the duration you need it to. And you don't\nwant to have to carry a phone, a Bluetooth speaker, AND a battery pack if you\ndon't have to.\n\nGenerally speaking, the larger the speaker, the larger the battery, but that's\nnot always the case. Just look at our pick for Toughest Speaker, the Tronsmart\nForce. It tops out at about 15 hours, where similarly-sized speakers can get\nfive to 10 hours more per charge.\n\n## Here's the Bluetooth speaker we would buy\n\n![Ultimate Ears Wonderboom\n2](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/4x3.png)![Ultimate\nEars Wonderboom\n2](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/06/ue-\nwonderboom-2-hero-1.jpg?itok=XiYYB0PD)_Source: Android Central_\n\nWhen it comes to portable Bluetooth speakers, you need to consider a few\nfeatures in your product, including battery life, sound quality, and element\nresistance. The portability means you're going to want to take it places that\nmight be dangerous to electronics, so you're going to want a speaker that's\nbuilt to take on the go.\n\nThere's no shortage of Bluetooth speakers to choose from, but if we were\nbuying one, we'd go for the [Ultimate Ears Wonderboom\n2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NFP6D7Q/ref=twister_B07ZPQ2KCS?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU54067YYw).\nThe speaker sounds fantastic for what it costs, and offers excellent value for\nyour money. While there are more specialized options that prioritize things\nlike longer battery life or better sound, the Wonderboom 2 is the most well-\nrounded speaker, offering loud, punchy sound, water resistance, and excellent\nbattery life.\n\nDon't forget that we have several guides for different kinds of Bluetooth\nspeakers, including ranking them by affordability, outdoor usage, and\ninteroperability with smart voice assistants.\n\n  * [Best Bluetooth Speakers under $50](/best-cheap-bluetooth-speakers-under-50)\n  * [Best Bluetooth Speakers under $100](/best-bluetooth-speakers-under-100)\n  * [Best Portable Bluetooth Speakers for Outdoor Sports](/best-water-resistant-bluetooth-speakers)\n  * [Best Bluetooth Speakers to Pair with Amazon Echo Input](/best-bluetooth-speakers-pair-amazon-echo-input)\n\n## Credits \u2014 The team that worked on this guide\n\n![](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/1x1.png)![](https://passport.mobilenations.com/avatars/000/010/352/100x100_10352017.jpg?r=3)\n\n**Hayato Huseman** is a recovering trade show addict and video editor for\nAndroid Central based out of Indianapolis.
