And in the last decade or so, as this product\nspace has steadily risen in demand, the market has been treated to an\nincreasing number of these wireless portable speakers. And while this affords\nbuyers an enormous number of options, it can also make it difficult to narrow\ndown which speaker is best for you.\n\nWith this in mind, we\u2019ve reviewed the last few years of releases and launches\nto generate this guide to the best portable Bluetooth speakers currently on\nthe market. Below we\u2019ll be exploring what factors and features to consider\nwhen in the market for one of these [wireless\nspeakers](https://hiconsumption.com/best-multi-room-wireless-speakers/), as\nwell as our choices for the dozen best items that are out there. So, whether\nyou\u2019re looking for a small personal speaker to take to the trails, or a plus-\nsized stereo to provide the soundtrack at your next party, this list has you\ncovered.\n\nPhoto: Bose SoundLink Revolve+\n\n## A Guide To Making A Sound Purchase\n\n11 Factors To Consider When Shopping For A Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\nBecause every portable Bluetooth speaker performs the same primary function of\nplaying music, it can be a bit confusing on the surface to understand the\nfiner points of what distinguishes the different available models on the\nmarket. Knowing this, we\u2019ve put together this section to educate you on what\nto focus on when buying a portable Bluetooth speaker.\n\n**Intended Use:** One of, if not the biggest guiding factor when shopping for\na portable [Bluetooth speaker](https://hiconsumption.com/best-bluetooth-\nspeakers-for-your-home/), intended use will dictate what size product you want\nand what features and amenities you\u2019ll need. Today\u2019s market boasts everything\nfrom pocket-sized speakers with built-in carabiners all the way up to classic\nboombox-sized party speakers. Think about the setting and conditions in which\nyou plan on using the speaker and use that as a starting point to help\ndetermine how much battery life you\u2019ll need and what kind of volume outputs\nyou\u2019ll want your speaker to be capable of.\n\n**Size & Weight:** Portable Bluetooth speakers come in a huge range of sizes,\nfrom items you can fit in the palm of one hand, to speakers that require two\nto hold. If you plan on using a speaker for camping or off-the-grid use,\ncompactness and minimal weight are going to be king, though if you plan on\nusing the speaker for rooftop kickbacks or [backyard\nBBQs](https://hiconsumption.com/best-grocery-store-bbq-sauces/), compactness\nand weight are much less an issue.\n\n**Music Playback Time:** Far more important than general battery life, music\nplayback time gives you a realistic understanding of low long a speaker can\nblare out your tunes before needing to be reconnected to a power source. It is\nimportant to note that this metric can be affected by factors such as volume,\nboosted bass, or other supplementary features or functions.\n\n**Recharge Time:** Just as important as how long a battery can last is how\nlong it takes that battery to charge. Most modern portable Bluetooth speakers\ncan be fully recharged within a few hours, though there are some that can\nyield several hours of music playback after only a few minutes of charging.\n\n**Materials & Construction:** This area is also one of the more important\nones, as it determines [the materials](https://hiconsumption.com/best-gear-\nmade-from-recycled-materials/) used to house a stereo\u2019s audio components as\nwell as how they were pieced together. Manufacturers that use high-quality\nmaterials such as steel, aluminum, leather, etc, will seldom fail to highlight\nsuch.\n\nPhoto: Bose SoundLink Micro\n\n**Ruggedness & Waterproofing:** Because portable Bluetooth speakers are\ndesigned for use outside of the home, they face a much larger number of\npotential hazards compared to indoor floorstanding or [bookshelf\nspeakers](https://hiconsumption.com/best-bookshelf-speakers/). As such,\nportable Bluetooth speakers are often designed and engineered to withstand\nsome abuse, though to what degree can hugely vary. Another important element\nto keep an eye out for is a speaker\u2019s waterproof/water-resistance rating,\nwhich is usually denoted via an IP/IPX-rating.\n\n**Sound Quality:** Just like with any other type of speaker or headphones, the\ndifferent transducers and components used to comprise a speaker will massively\neffect said speaker\u2019s audio quality (and clarity). The lion\u2019s share of\nspeakers will list specific specs that should help give you a general sense of\na speaker\u2019s sound quality.\n\n**Manufacturer:** Even if you aren\u2019t able to glean any meaningful info from\nlooking at a given speaker\u2019s frequency ranges and response rates, you can\noften get a general sense of how a speaker will perform in terms of sound\nquality and clarity based on who happens to be the manufacturer. While there\nare occasionally exceptions and outliers, you can typically trust that a\nspeaker made by a reputable American, Scandinavian, or [German\nbrand](https://hiconsumption.com/best-german-watch-brands/) will likely boast\na level of audio quality roughly on-par with the rest of that particular\nbrand\u2019s standards.\n\n**Extra Amenities:** Every portable Bluetooth speaker on the market will\nprovide you with an on-the-go means of listening to your music via a wireless\nconnection, though some speakers also afford their users supplementary\nfeatures such as built-in LED lights, internal power banks and USB ports for\ncharging smartphones and other devices, and integrated microphones for taking\ncalls or hands-free music playback controls.\n\n**Industrial Design:** Aside from usually being fairly compact, portable\nBluetooth speakers come in a myriad of shapes, designs, and colors. From\nsimple cylindrical items to modern Scandinavian-designed speakers, to\n[carabiner-style items](https://hiconsumption.com/best-edc-carabiner-\nkeychains/), there\u2019s a surprising amount of aesthetic diversity in this space,\nmaking it well worth research what all is out there before pulling the trigger\non your purchase.\n\n**Price:** While construction and materials, battery life, and sound quality\nare all of utmost importance, they should all be viewed relative to a\nspeaker\u2019s MSRP. Just like any other modern gadget, portable Bluetooth speakers\ncan vary hugely in price, and though there are some ridiculously-\ncompetitively-priced items out there, we\u2019d argue it\u2019s well worth investing a\nlittle extra to ensure you\u2019re getting your hands on a quality product that\nwill serve you for years.\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/AKG-Travel-Bluetooth-Wireless-\nSpeaker/dp/B07BR47V79/)\n\n### AKG S30\n\nTouted as an all-in-one travel speaker, AKG\u2019s S30 is a highly-compact gadget\nthat\u2019s brimming with features and functionality. The speaker plays through a\npair of 36mm drivers that have been painstakingly-tuned to the German brand\u2019s\nusual top-notch standards, resulting in a potent little stereo with sound that\npunches well above its weight class. Deceptively rugged, this unassuming\nspeaker boasts an aluminum unibody housing with diamond-cut edges, as well as\na pair of integrated microphones with noise and echo-canceling and a Lithium-\npolymer 2,500mAh [power bank](https://hiconsumption.com/best-portable-power-\nbanks/) that can refuel other mobile devices via a USB port. Weighing just\n300g (0.66lbs), this trusty little speaker offers up to ten hours of music\nplayback time. Equipped with Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity, the S30 also comes\nwith an auxiliary 1/8th input for wired connections. And though this item\ninitially retailed for $150, you can now snag one at the link below for just\nunder half that amount.\n\n[Purchase: $70](https://www.amazon.com/AKG-Travel-Bluetooth-Wireless-\nSpeaker/dp/B07BR47V79/)\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Micro-Bluetooth-\nspeaker/dp/B0748N1BZD/)\n\n### Bose SoundLink Micro\n\nThe Bose Soundlink Micro is a potent little speaker that, despite its\nincredibly-compact 3.87\u2033 x 3.87\u2033 x 1.37\u2033 form, manages to cram a slew of\nmodern amenities into the 0.64lb (290 gram) device. The gadget earns a rugged\nIPX7-rating thanks to an entirely silicone-covered housing that makes it\ncompletely impervious to water damage, so much so that it can be submerged a\nfull meter underwater without any issues. Inside, custom-designed transducers\nhave been paired with a set of silicone passive radiators that together afford\nshockingly crisp and clear sound considering the speaker\u2019s size. Offering a\ngenerous 30\u2019 range, the device also has a built-in microphone that allows you\nto calls and use on Siri or a smart home assistant, plus the Soundlink Micro\ncan be linked to the Bose Connect app where the speaker can be tweaked and\nadjusted, or set in \u201cparty\u201d mode to link up with other nearby speakers. Other\nnoteworthy elements include six hours of music playback time per charge and a\ntear-resistant silicone strap that can conveniently loop around a carabiner,\nMOLLE webbing, or on a [bike\u2019s handlebars](https://hiconsumption.com/best-\nfixed-gear-bikes/).\n\n[Purchase: $79+](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Micro-Bluetooth-\nspeaker/dp/B0748N1BZD/)\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Bluetooth-Wireless-Hardshell-\nProtective/dp/B08BPL5BC1/)\n\n### Sony SRS-XB23 EXTRA BASS\n\nSony\u2019s SRS-XB23 EXTRA BASS was designed to provide an easy and reliable means\nof taking your music with you anywhere. As its moniker implies, this product\nwas developed with a special focus on producing a deep and heavy low-end\nthough the rest of its frequency range is nothing to scoff at. A cylindrical\ndesign helps to minimize space and make the speaker particularly easy to slip\ninto a glove compartment or backpack, as well as the cupholder of a car or\n[camp chair](https://hiconsumption.com/best-camping-chairs/). This travel-\nfriendly speaker is also sold with an included hardshell travel case that\u2019s\nmade especially for the Sony device by Knox Gear. IP67-rated, this speaker has\nabsolutely no problem standing up to dust, dirt, rain, or the elements, plus\nthe SRS-XB23 was also extensively drop-tested, resulting in a largely\nshockproof body. The SRS-XB23 also gets a battery that allows for up to 12\nhours of music playback time.\n\n[Purchase: $100](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Bluetooth-Wireless-Hardshell-\nProtective/dp/B08BPL5BC1/)\n\n[](https://www.marshallheadphones.com/us/en/emberton.html)\n\n### Marshall Emberton\n\nReleased at the beginning of the month, the Emberton is a cutting-edge\nportable Bluetooth speaker dressed up in the British brand\u2019s signature style.\nThe crisp booming sound comes from a pair of 2\u201d 10W full-range drivers with\npassive radiators set behind Marshall\u2019s classic white script badge and cross-\nwire grille. The Emberton\u2019s timeless design has been paired with a\nminimalistic and intuitive control layout boasting only the bare essentials,\nwith the top of the device sporting a brass multi-directional control knob, an\nLED battery level indicator, and a Bluetooth pairing button. The speaker also\nbenefits from the London-based firm\u2019s True Stereophonic\n[360-degree](https://hiconsumption.com/best-360-degree-action-cameras/) sound\nwhich emits sound waves in every direction. The battery on the Emberton is no\nless impressive, offering more than 20 hours of music playback time and only\ntaking three hours to fully recharge, though 20 minutes of charging allows for\nanother five hours of playback. Utilizing Bluetooth 5.0-connectivity, the\nEmberton also has a 30\u2019 range. Weighing 1.5lbs, the speaker is also\nIPX7-rated.\n\n[Purchase: $150](https://www.marshallheadphones.com/us/en/emberton.html)\n\n[](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/speakers/beosound-a1)\n\n### Bang & Olufsen Beosound A1 2nd Gen\n\nAn even more refined version of the Danish company\u2019s Beosound A1, the second\ngeneration of the speaker gains a host of updates and upgrades, including\nIP67-certification Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity, and bolstered (3,000mAh)\nbattery life with a collective 18 hours of music playback. Debuting in May\n2020, this new version of the Beosound A1 also gets a trio of internal\nmicrophones that allow for hands-free functionality and the use of smart voice\nassistants.Bestowed with True360 omnidirectional sound, this Scandinavian\nspeaker\u2019s transducers consist of a 3.5\u201d woofer and a 3/5\u201d tweeter \u2014 with a\nfrequency range between 55-20.000Hz \u2013 that is backed by a pair of 30W [Class D\namps](https://hiconsumption.com/best-guitar-amplifiers-for-beginners/),\nenabling the circular speaker to blare out at up to 92dB.

And the audio outfit marches on\ntoday with this same proclivity for audiophile-grade sound, albeit in a\ncontemporary form with Harmon Kardon\u2019s Onyx Studio 6.

With an IPX7-rating\nyou also won\u2019t have to worry about its electronics being compromised should it\nface any outdoor elements.\n\n[Purchase: $300](https://www.harmankardon.com/bluetooth-\nspeakers/ONYX+STUDIO+6.html)\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Portable-Long-Lasting-\nBluetooth/dp/B06XCW4VFS/)\n\n### Bose SoundLink Revolve+\n\nBoasting unibody aluminum housing, the Bose Soundlink Revolve+ speaker offers\na range of up to 30\u2019 and a 16-hour battery life.

On top of being IPX4-rated, the\nSoundlink Revolve+ is equipped with impact-resistant top and bottom covers.

Inside, a\npair of 4.5\u201d woofers and dual 1\u201d tweeters flow through 7.5\u201d passive radiators\nsing out at up to an earsplitting 100dB and boast six-times the bass of the\nbrand\u2019s popular MEGABOOM 3 speaker.

The\nDanish brand starts with a pair of 0.82\u201d light-weight soft dome tweeters and\n3.5\u201d aluminum woofers that deliver signal through a digital amp and have been\nfortified behind an extruded aluminum cabinet mated to ABS and polycarbonate\ncomposite baffles front and aft via screws and an airtight EVA gasket.
