To make the water resistance work, the speaker has rubbery\npanels instead of clicky buttons, and they aren't half hard to depress\nsometimes.

A wireless speaker can be put anywhere, providing it's near enough to its source device \u2013 smartphone, computer, or otherwise. Keep in mind indoor speakers won't usually be waterproof, though. So it's always best to get one built for the outdoors to be safe.\n  *  **What's a good wattage for outdoor speakers?** 5W might be suitable for a quiet picnic, but you'll want more for a bustling BBQ or party out of doors. For comparison, most smart TVs come with maximum 10W speakers.\n  *  **How many outdoor speakers do I need?** This depends on the volume of the device and where you're putting it. For covering various spots around a garden or yard, you may want several.\n\n### Waterproof vs water resistant\n\n## Waterproof vs water-resistant speakers\n\nWhile waterproof and water-resistant aren't synonymous, they roughly translate\nto 'water won't ruin it'.\n\nWhen hunting for the best waterproof speaker for the great outdoors, look for\nits IP rating. This is how water resistance gadgets are categorized. You'll\nsee that IP mark, followed by two numbers \u2013 IP67 is one of the most common,\nand means the speaker can be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes. This is\nthe one you want and means it's a great option for waterproofing and one of\nthe best outdoor speakers your money can buy.\n\nWhich is best for you?\n\nThere are lots of speaker styles to choose from \u2013 that's why we've put\ntogether lots of guides on the best speakers you can buy in 2020:\n\n\\- [Best Bluetooth speakers](https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/portable-\naudio/10-best-portable-speakers-1069079)\n\n\\- [Best stereo speakers](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-stereo-speakers)\n\n\\- [Best wireless speakers](https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/portable-\naudio/10-best-portable-speakers-1069079/news/best-speaker)\n\n\\- [Best smart speakers](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-smart-speakers)\n\n\\- [Best Dolby Atmos speakers](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-dolby-\natmos-speaker-guide)\n\n\\- [Best soundbars](https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/home-cinema-audio/tr-\ntop-10-best-soundbars-1288008)\n\nAnd don't miss our round up of the [best\nturntables](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-turntables) to go with your\nnew speaker.\n\n **Waterproof** is the better of the two, as it usually carries an IP67 rating\nthat means it can withstand to float in around a meter of water for a half-\nhour before it bites the dust.\n\n**Water-resistant** , on the other hand, means it could survive a splash or\ntwo, but it's not the kind of thing you'd just want to casually throw in the\npool.\n\nOf course waterproofing isn't the only thing we looked for when picking out\nthis list of the best outdoor speakers. We also considered factors such as\nsound quality, price and feature set, all of which helped establish a set of\ncriteria that we could measure all speakers against. What you see above is the\nresult of that effort \u2013 our definitive list of the 10 best wireless portable\nwaterproof speakers.\n\n### Deals\n\nRound up of today's best deals\n\nUltimate Ears - WONDERBOOM 2...\n\n[Ultimate Ears Wonderboom\n2](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/221109/633495/10014?prodsku=6357654&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6357654%2Fpdp&intsrc=CATF_4831&subId1=trd-\nus-4267979798095681500)\n\nBest Buy\n\n[$79.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/221109/633495/10014?prodsku=6357654&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6357654%2Fpdp&intsrc=CATF_4831&subId1=trd-\nus-6797675099666302000)\n\n[View](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/221109/633495/10014?prodsku=6357654&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6357654%2Fpdp&intsrc=CATF_4831&subId1=trd-\nus-1409894991202957000)\n\n[See all\nprices](https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?model_name=Ultimate%20Ears%20Wonderboom%202)\n\nDenon DSB-250BT Envaya...\n\n[Denon Envaya\nDSB-250BT](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0777BVB82%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-\nus-8627627355847608000-20)\n\nAmazon\n\n[$199](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0777BVB82%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-\nus-8627627355847608000-20)\n\n[View](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0777BVB82%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-\nus-8627627355847608000-20)\n\n[See all\nprices](https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?model_name=Denon%20Envaya%20DSB-250BT)\n\nJBL Lifestyle Flip 5 Portable...\n\n[JBL Flip\n5](https://imp.i114863.net/c/221109/794166/11319?prodsku=Flip5Blk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FFlip5Blk\n--jbl-lifestyle-flip-5-portable-waterproof-bluetooth-speaker-\nblack&intsrc=CATF_5713&subId1=trd-us-1003959974296945800)\n\nSweetwater Sound\n\n[$89.95](https://imp.i114863.net/c/221109/794166/11319?prodsku=Flip5Blk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FFlip5Blk\n--jbl-lifestyle-flip-5-portable-waterproof-bluetooth-speaker-\nblack&intsrc=CATF_5713&subId1=trd-us-1355699421980242400)\n\n[View](https://imp.i114863.net/c/221109/794166/11319?prodsku=Flip5Blk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FFlip5Blk\n--jbl-lifestyle-flip-5-portable-waterproof-bluetooth-speaker-\nblack&intsrc=CATF_5713&subId1=trd-us-1350971015882878500)\n\n[See all\nprices](https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?model_name=JBL%20Flip%205)\n\nAnker Soundcore Flare Black &...\n\n[Anker Soundcore\nFlare](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07BHP4W36%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-\nus-8055318587722000000-20)\n\nAmazon\n\n[$64](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07BHP4W36%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-\nus-8055318587722000000-20)\n\n[View](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07BHP4W36%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-\nus-8055318587722000000-20)\n\n[See all\nprices](https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?model_name=Anker%20Soundcore%20Flare)\n\nUltimate Ears -
