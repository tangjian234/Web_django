This ensures the speaker can hold up to\nthe moisture exposure from steam or splashes. (BestReviews)\n\nMusic is totally portable these days, and it's in no way limited to\nheadphones. Now you can enjoy your favorite beats with those around you by\ninvesting in a mini Bluetooth speaker.\n\nWith their small footprint, mini Bluetooth speakers are easy to toss into your\nhandbag or backpack. Whether you're heading to a campsite, park, or the\noffice, a mini Bluetooth speaker is essential. Their long-lasting batteries\nand impressive sound quality make streaming music from your devices totally\nenjoyable and stress-free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeep reading this buying guide to hear more about these tiny wonders. At the\nend, you'll find our recommendations, including our top pick, the [Bose\nSoundlink Color Bluetooth Speaker\nII](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HETFQKS/?tag=tcausailchtr1109-20),\nwhich is compatible with digital assistants like Siri or Google Now.\n\n**Considerations when choosing mini Bluetooth speakers**\n\nAdvertisement\n\n**Size and weight**\n\nMini Bluetooth speakers are available in a variety of sizes and weights to\nsuit your portability needs. The smallest ones are a mere two or three ounces,\nwhereas larger ones weigh up to four pounds. Keep in mind that size may affect\nsound quality, especially in those with single or smaller speakers.\n\n**Bluetooth range**\n\nOn average, mini Bluetooth speakers have a connection range of 20 to 100 feet.\nThis is important if you intend to set it up in an open space, such as at a\ncampsite, or if you would like to pair it with nearby devices within range.\n\n**Battery life**\n\nMost models will last between eight and 10 hours, though premium models have a\nrobust battery life of almost 24 hours. Keep in mind that the battery life of\nmini Bluetooth speakers, as with other electronics, can be affected by a\nnumber of variables, such as charge quality or continuous play.\n\n**Sound quality**\n\nSmaller speakers can have a tendency to distort sound quality at louder\nvolumes, so it's worth comparing specs to find a mini Bluetooth speaker with\nattributes to produce the best sound. It's a good idea to invest in those with\nhigher wattage, as they can emit more decibels. Speakers with a higher\nfrequency range and lower impedance will also have dramatically better sound\nquality.\n\n**Features**\n\n**Device pairing**\n\nSelect mini Bluetooth speakers can be paired with multiple devices. While it\nmight not be an essential feature if your speaker is more for personal use, if\nyou'd like to link up several speakers to create an enviable sound system,\nit's nothing short of a must-have.\n\n**Voice commands**\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome mini Bluetooth speakers respond to voice commands, making it effortless\nto change songs or adjust settings. It's a nice feature if your hands are\ndirty or occupied, such as when you're working outdoors or cooking.\n\nMini Bluetooth speakers with built-in assistants, such as Google Assistant,\nhave risen in popularity. In addition to listening to music, you'll be able to\naccess apps, look up information, or set timers.\n\n**Durability**\n\nMini Bluetooth speakers are usually designed to handle rough usage and outdoor\nconditions. Some are waterproof or water-resistant for use poolside or at the\nbeach. There are also dust-resistant speakers, which are great for camping, as\nwell as shock-resistant ones, typically used by hikers or bikers.\n\n**Price**\n\nMini Bluetooth speakers priced between $30 and $75 often have 12 hours or more\nof playtime and some expanded functionality. Speakers closer to $125 often\nhave built-in assistants. If you'd like superior sound quality and voice-\ncommand features, be prepared to spend $125 and up.\n\n**FAQ**\n\n**Q. Are all smartphones and tablets compatible with mini Bluetooth\nspeakers?**\n\n**A.** While most are, there are some outliers, including older devices or\nthose with outdated software. Before you buy, be sure to check the speaker's\ncompatibility requirements to make sure your phones and tablets will work with\nit.\n\n**Q. How many devices can I pair with my mini Bluetooth speakers?**\n\n**A.** It depends on the model. Some speakers, such as those manufactured by\nJBL, can be paired with as many as 100 devices. Other speakers are more\nlimited, so they can only be paired with two or three at a time.\n\n**Mini Bluetooth speakers we recommend**\n\n**Best of the best:**[Bose's Soundlink Color Bluetooth Speaker II in Soft\nBlack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HETFQKS/?tag=tcausailchtr1109-20)\n\n**Our take:** Offers signature Bose sound quality and a sleek design available\nin soft black (featured here) as well as several other colors, including\n[aquatic blue](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Color-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker/dp/B01HETFPK4?tag=tcausailchtr1109-20), [polar\nwhite](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Color-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker/dp/B01HETFQKI?tag=tcausailchtr1109-20), and [yellow\ncitron](https://www.amazon.com/SoundLink-Color-Bluetooth-speaker-\nII/dp/B07RHTTRMW?tag=tcausailchtr1109-20).\n\n**What we like:** Voice-prompted connectivity.
