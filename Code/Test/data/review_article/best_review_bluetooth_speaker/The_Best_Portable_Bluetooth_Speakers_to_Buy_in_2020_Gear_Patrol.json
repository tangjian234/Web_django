It\u2019s extremely waterproof and has a\ndedicated button on the outside to boost its bass if you\u2019re into that sort of\nthing. Additionally, through Anker\u2019s Soundcore app, you can tweak the EQ\nsettings and customize the LED lights that flash on the outside of the\nspeaker.\n\n[Buy Now: $43 (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Soundcore-Bluetooth-\nWaterproof-technology/dp/B07PPNY861/?tag=geapat-20)\n\n## The Most Important Factors to Consider\n\nSo you want to make a carefully considered choice. Good on you! There are a\nlot of factors to consider, and Bluetooth speakers come in all different\nshapes and sizes, with different sound qualities and price points. Here\u2019s the\nshort list of things to make note of.\n\n### Brand\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of all the speaker manufacturers on this list, which is\na good thing. You want to trust that the speaker is not only going to sound\ngood but also last. Many portable speakers on this list work with other like-\nbranded speakers; for instance, you can pair two Bose Soundlink speakers\ntogether or two of Kicker\u2019s Bullfrog speakers together for more of a party (or\nmultiroom) setup. So there is an advantage to sticking to one flavor if you\nhave that usecase in mind.\n\n### Size and Shape\n\nGenerally, the bigger the speaker, the louder and better it is going to sound.\nYou also want to consider the shape and design of the speaker. The two most\npopular shapes these days are 360-degree (cylindrical) or monodirectional\nspeakers. The 360-degree speakers are generally better when placed in the\nmiddle of a room while monodirectional speakers are better for stereo audio.\n\n### Ruggedness\n\nAll rugged speakers aren\u2019t the same. And in order to know how water-resistant\nor drop-proof a speaker is, you really need to understand IP (Ingress\nProtection) ratings. The easy way to explain it is that the higher the IP\nrating of the speaker, the more water-resistant it is \u2014 an IP7-rated speaker\nis more durable than an IP4-rated speaker. You can check out how the IP\nratings are explained,\n_[here](https://www.westmarine.com/WestAdvisor/Understanding-IP-Ratings)_.\n\n### Voice Assistance\n\nSome of the newer portable speakers have wi-fi connectivity and support a\nvoice assistant, such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Google Assistant. This allows you\nto use a speaker similar to an Amazon Echo or Google Home, using voice\ncommands to request songs, answer general queries and control smart home\ndevices. However, you\u2019ll only be able to access the voice assistant when\nconnected to wi-fi or a mobile hotspot.\n\n### Battery Life\n\nBigger speakers tend to have larger and longer-lasting batteries. That said,\nit varies from speaker to speaker. If you know you\u2019re going to listen to the\nspeaker a lot and you\u2019re also going to have to go days between charges, these\nare things you should consider before purchasing a portable speaker.\n\n### Charge\n\nMost of today\u2019s portable speakers need a micro-USB cable to charge. However,\nthere are some speakers that require a USB-C or AC cable to charge. Knowing\nwhat kind of cable might seem like a small thing, but it\u2019s actually really\nconvenient to be able to use the same cables to charge a few of your devices,\nlike wireless headphones, your smartphone and computer.\n\n## Other Good Options\n\n### Bose SoundLink Revolve and Revolve Plus\n\n[\n\n](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Portable-Long-Lasting-\nBluetooth/dp/B06XCW4VFS/?tag=geapat-20)\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Portable-Long-Lasting-\nBluetooth/dp/B06XCW4VFS/?tag=geapat-20)  \n**Release date:** 2017  \n **Drivers:** Dual passive radiators, downward-facing transducer, deflector  \n **Battery:** Up to 16 hours  \n **Waterproof:** IPX4 (splash-proof)  \n **Charge:** Micro-USB  \nThe Bose SoundLink Revolve and Revolve Plus are the company\u2019s first 360-degree\nBluetooth speakers. They\u2019re loud and powerful, and they\u2019re able to deliver\naccurate and spacious audio; each speaker is engineered with dual-opposing\npassive-radiators and an efficient transducer to eliminate distortion. They\u2019re\nnot the most rugged speakers on this list, but each still splash-resistant.\nAnd their simple design and easily-defined buttons make this traditional\nBluetooth speaker very intuitive to use. It also has a built-in mic so you can\nanswer calls without having to take out your phone. For anybody who loves the\nBose sound and style, the SoundLink Revolve and Revolve Plus are a solid buy.\n\n[Buy Now: $199 (Revolve)\n](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=31959X896062&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fspeakers%2Fportable_speakers%2Fsoundlink_revolve.html&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gearpatrol.com%2Ftech%2Fa432677%2Fbest-\nbluetooth-\nspeakers%2F%3Fpre%3Dtech%252F%26prefix%3Da%26id%3D432677%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fbest-\nbluetooth-speakers)\n\n[Buy Now: $299 (Revolve Plus)\n](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=31959X896062&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fspeakers%2Fportable_speakers%2Fsoundlink_revolve_plus.html&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gearpatrol.com%2Ftech%2Fa432677%2Fbest-\nbluetooth-\nspeakers%2F%3Fpre%3Dtech%252F%26prefix%3Da%26id%3D432677%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fbest-\nbluetooth-speakers)\n\n[Read the Review](https://gearpatrol.com/2018/05/17/bose-soundlink-revolve-\nplus-speaker-review/)\n\n### Anker Soundcore Motion+\n\n[\n\n](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Soundcore-Bluetooth-Customizable-\nWaterproof/dp/B07P39MLKH?tag=geapat-20)\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Soundcore-Bluetooth-Customizable-\nWaterproof/dp/B07P39MLKH?tag=geapat-20)  \n**Release date:** 2018  \n **Drivers:** Two high-frequency tweeters, two neodymium woofers, one passive\nradiator  \n **Battery:** Up to 12 hours  \n **Waterproof:** IPX7  \n **Charge:** USB-C  \nThe Motion+ might just be the best-sounding portable speaker at the $100 price\npoint.

It\u2019s no small fry, either, weighing in at 13 pounds and reach\nup to roughly a grown person\u2019s knees. It\u2019s a 270-degree, not a true 360-degree\nspeaker, meaning it\u2019s best placed in the corner of a room rather than the\ncenter. It\u2019s also Bluetooth-only speaker, (no Wi-Fi, like the Sonos Move and\nUE Megablast), so it can\u2019t be used as a smart speaker. The Hyperboom is a\nspeaker that\u2019s designed for people looking for a versatile party speaker that\ncan be carried around the house.\n\n[Buy Now: $400\n(UE)](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=31959X896062&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ultimateears.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fwireless-\nspeakers%2Fhyperboom.html&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gearpatrol.com%2Ftech%2Fa432677%2Fbest-\nbluetooth-\nspeakers%2F%3Fpre%3Dtech%252F%26prefix%3Da%26id%3D432677%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fbest-\nbluetooth-speakers)\n\n[Buy Now: $400 (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Ears-HYPERBOOM-\nBluetooth-Resistant/dp/B07XJ8B9NV?tag=geapat-20)\n\n### Bose Portable Home Speaker\n\n[\n\n](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=31959X896062&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fspeakers%2Fsmart_home%2Fbose-\nportable-home-\nspeaker.html&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gearpatrol.com%2Ftech%2Fa432677%2Fbest-\nbluetooth-\nspeakers%2F%3Fpre%3Dtech%252F%26prefix%3Da%26id%3D432677%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fbest-\nbluetooth-speakers)\n\n[](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=31959X896062&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fspeakers%2Fsmart_home%2Fbose-\nportable-home-\nspeaker.html&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gearpatrol.com%2Ftech%2Fa432677%2Fbest-\nbluetooth-\nspeakers%2F%3Fpre%3Dtech%252F%26prefix%3Da%26id%3D432677%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fbest-\nbluetooth-speakers)  \n**Release date:** Late-2019  \n **Drivers:** High-excursion driver, three passive radiators, deflector  \n **Battery:** Up to 12 hours  \n **Waterproof:** IPX 4  \n **Charge:** USB-C\n\nBose offers a variety of smart home speakers that work with Alexa and Google\nAssistant, like the [Home Speaker\n300](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=31959X896062&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fspeakers%2Fsmart_home%2Fsmart_speakers.html&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gearpatrol.com%2Ftech%2Fa432677%2Fbest-\nbluetooth-\nspeakers%2F%3Fpre%3Dtech%252F%26prefix%3Da%26id%3D432677%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fbest-\nbluetooth-speakers) and [Home Speaker\n500](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=31959X896062&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fspeakers%2Fsmart_home%2Fsmart_speakers.html&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gearpatrol.com%2Ftech%2Fa432677%2Fbest-\nbluetooth-\nspeakers%2F%3Fpre%3Dtech%252F%26prefix%3Da%26id%3D432677%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fbest-\nbluetooth-speakers), but they require constant power.
