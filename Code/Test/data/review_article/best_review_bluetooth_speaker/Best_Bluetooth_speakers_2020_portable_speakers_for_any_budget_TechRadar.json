That's why we\u2019ve done\nthe research and picked out the very best portable speakers you can buy in\n2020.\n\nThese days many of the best Bluetooth speakers now also come with voice\nassistants, like Alexa and [Google Assistant](https://www.techradar.com/how-\nto/google-assistant-how-to-make-your-google-home-speaker-work-for-you) built-\nin. This means that some wireless speakers can double up as [smart\nspeakers](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-smart-speakers), which you can\nuse to control your [smart home devices](https://www.techradar.com/news/smart-\nhome-devices).\n\nThere are plenty of pair-and-play devices out there too, if the best Bluetooth\nspeaker for you has a simpler setup.\n\nWhatever kind of portable speaker you're looking for, we hope this guide helps\nyou to choose the best Bluetooth speaker for your needs, wants, and budget.\n\n _[Update: A great pair of_[ _wireless\nheadphones_](https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/portable-audio/best-\nwireless-headphones-1280344) _and a portable Bluetooth speaker are essentials\nfor any music lover who likes to take their tunes on the go \u2013 but buying all\nthat kit can get expensive._\n\n _However, what if you could combine both form factors?

Sonos Move\n\nThe best Bluetooth speaker in the world, Sonos Move brings the party indoors\nand outside\n\n **Weight:** 6.61 pounds (3kg) | **Battery life:** 10 hours |\n**Connectivity:** Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n, 2.4 GHz, and 5GHz) and Bluetooth 4.2 |\n**Drivers:** One down-firing tweeter, one mid-woofer, two Class-D digital\namplifiers | **NFC:** No | **Aux-in:** No | **USB charging:** Yes (USB-C, and\ncomes with charging dock)\n\nIntegrates with a home Sonos speaker network\n\nOn-the-go tunes\n\nNot as feature-rich when using Bluetooth\n\nCant be used as rear cinema speakers\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about the [Sonos\nMove](https://web.archive.org/web/20200402230102/https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/sonos-\nmove-review) \u2013 it\u2019s so good, you might want to consider it not only as your\non-the-go party station, but also as your main in-the-home [wireless\nspeaker](https://web.archive.org/web/20200402230102/https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-\nspeaker) too.\n\nWith two quality drivers, a solid app that unlocks playback from hundreds of\nwireless sources, multi-room capabilities and smart audio-tuning tech which\ntweaks the output based on the speaker's immediate surroundings, the Sonos\nMove is engineered well beyond your average Bluetooth speaker. It's a\nversatile speaker, one that stands solidly alongside the built-for-home Sonos\nspeakers that the company made its name on.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect \u2013 it\u2019s heavy as a byproduct of its incredible sound, it\u2019s\nexpensive due to its rich feature set, and it sadly can\u2019t be used as rear\nchannels for a home cinema set-up. But if you\u2019ve got the money, it\u2019s hard to\nfault the Sonos Move when it comes to hunting down the very best Bluetooth\nspeaker in the world.\n\n **Read the full review:** [Sonos Move\nreview](https://web.archive.org/web/20200402230102/https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/sonos-\nmove-review)\n\n  * [Is Apple about to buy smart speaker giant Sonos?](https://www.techradar.com/news/is-apple-about-to-buy-smart-speaker-giant-sonos)\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n![ue boom 3](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Ultimate Ears)\n\n### 2\\. UE Boom 3\n\nThe former best Bluetooth speaker is still great for travelling with\n\n **Weight:** 1.2 pounds | **Battery life:** 15 hours | **Wireless range:** 30+\nfeet | **Frequency response:** 90Hz-20kHz | **Drivers:** Two 1.75\" drivers and\ntwo 1.75\" x 3\" passive radiators | **NFC:** Yes | **Aux-in:** No | **USB\ncharging:** Yes\n\nIP67 waterproof/dust-proof\n\nPowerful sound\n\nRugged design\n\nAudio could be clearer\n\nWhile we weren't as impressed with the UE Boom 3 as we were with its\npredecessor the [UE Boom 2](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/hi-\nfi-and-audio/hi-fi-and-av-speakers/ue-boom-2-1311342/review), this is still\none of the best Bluetooth speakers money can buy in 2020. This is a speaker\nthat can get loud and not distort at higher volumes; be light enough to carry\non a camping trip but remain durable enough to tumble in a bag unprotected.\n\nIt's both water and dust-proof, and now has a one-touch mix button that lets\nyou pull up your favorite playlists without ever picking up your phone.\n\nThere are certainly more detailed portable speakers out there, but at a price\nthat's relatively affordable to all, the UE Boom 3 hits all the right notes\nfor the third year in a row.\n\n[Ultimate Ears now lets you customize your UE Boom\n3](https://www.techradar.com/news/ultimate-ears-now-lets-you-customize-your-\nue-boom-3-speaker), so you have even more options when it comes to color and\npattern combinations.\n\n **Read the full review:**[UE Boom 3\nreview](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ultimate-ears-boom-3)\n\n _[Update:_[ _Marshall's new Bluetooth speaker comes with a battery life to\nbeat the UE Boom 3_](https://www.techradar.com/news/marshalls-new-bluetooth-\nspeaker-comes-with-battery-life-to-beat-ue-boom-3) _; the Marshall Emberton is\nthe brand's smallest portable speaker yet.]_\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n![jbl flip 5](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\n(Image credit: JBL)\n\n### 3\\. JBL Flip 5\n\nA fun, no frills portable speaker\n\n **Weight:** 1.2 pounds | **Battery life:** 12 hours | **Wireless range:** N/A\n| **Frequency response:** 65Hz - 20kHz | **Drivers:** 40mm | **NFC:** No |\n**Bluetooth version:** 4.2 | **Aux-in:** No | **USB charging:** No\n\nEngaging, entertaining sound\n\nEasy to use\n\nNo 3.5mm input\n\nNo mic for hands-free calls\n\nThe JBL Flip 5 is proof that the best Bluetooth speakers aren't always the\nones with the most impressive specs.\n\nJBL\u2019s Flip 5 is a simple soul with Bluetooth-only playback and modest\nfeatures, but if you desire a rugged, great-sounding portable speaker and can\nsacrifice voice control or hands-free call functionality, you won\u2019t be\ndisappointed.\n\nThanks to its neat design and IPX7 rating it's suitable for use outside as\nwell as in, making it an ideal outdoor speaker, too \u2013 and it's not too pricey\nat $119.95 / \u00a3119.99 / AU$149.95.\n\nComing in a range of cool colors \u2013 including an eye-catching camo print \u2013\nthere's now a limited Eco Edition that's made from 90% recycled plastic, while\nthe portable speaker\u2019s entire packaging is biodegradable.\n\n **Read the full review:**[JBL Flip 5\nreview](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/jbl-flip-5)\n\n _[Update: Don't miss our_[ _JBL Boombox 2\nreview_](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/jbl-boombox-2) _\u2013 we were mightily\nimpressed by this portable speaker's IPX7 waterproof rating, long battery\nlife, and distortion-free sound.]_\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n![bose portable\nhome](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Bose)\n\n### 4\\.

Anker Soundcore Flare\n\nThe best budget Bluetooth speaker\n\n **Weight:** 1.1 pounds | **Battery life:** 12 hours | **Wireless range:** 20m\n/ 66ft | **Frequency response:** N/A | **Drivers:** 2 x 1.75\" Full Range + 2 x\nPassive Radiator | **NFC:** No | **Aux-in:** Yes | **Bluetooth version:** 4.2\n| **Weatherproofing:** Yes-IPX7 | **Charges devices over USB:** No\n\nImpressive sound for the size\n\nExcellent mobile app\n\nWaterproof\n\nHarsh at max volume\n\nAnker has a history of making excellent budget wireless speakers. While we\nweren\u2019t entirely impressed with the [_Anker SoundCore\n2_](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/anker-soundcore-2)\u2019s sound, we couldn\u2019t\nbe too mad since the speaker was so affordable.\n\nSo what happens if you can stretch your budget? For around $20 more you get\nthe Anker Soundcore Flare, an excellent waterproof Bluetooth speaker that can\nstand toe-to-toe with the competition.\n\nThe Soundcore Flare is an amazing value in the sub-$100 wireless speaker\nsegment. Competitors like the UE Wonderboom (listed above) give the Flare a\nrun for its money in terms of build quality but we give the Flare the slight\nedge with sound quality. We recommend the Flare for anyone looking for a\nwireless speaker that can do it all without breaking the bank.\n\n**Read the full review:** [Anker Soundcore Flare\nreview](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/anker-soundcore-flare)\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n![ue wonderboom 2](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Ultimate Ears)\n\n### 6\\. UE Wonderboom 2\n\nThe best outdoor speaker gets a refresh\n\n **Weight:** 0.93 pounds | **Dimensions:** 104 x 95.3mm (H x D) | **Battery\nlife:** Up to 13 hours | **Wireless range:** 100 ft (33 m) | **Frequency\nresponse:** 75 Hz \u2013 20 kHz | **Drivers:** two 40 mm active drivers and two\n46.1mm x 65.2mm passive radiators | **NFC:** No | **Bluetooth version:** N/A |\n**Aux-in:** No | **USB charging:** No\n\nGreat sound for its size\n\nIP67 dustproof/waterproof rating\n\n30% better battery life\n\nRestrictive soundstage\n\nThe original [UE Wonderboom](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ue-wonderboom)\nhas been at the top of our [best waterproof\nspeaker](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-waterproof-speaker) list since\nits debut and for good reason: it\u2019s rugged, plays louder than its diminutive\nsound suggests, and could be paired to other UE Wonderboom speakers to amplify\nsound.\n\nAnd although the UE Wonderboom 2 looks nearly identical to the original,\nUltimate Ears packed in a slew of upgrades that make the Wonderboom 2 even\nbetter, like the increased battery life (up 30% compared to the original),\nbetter bass response, and the new Outdoor Boost feature that helps the speaker\nget even louder than before.\n\nThe UE Wonderboom 2 is a fantastic rugged and waterproof speaker you\u2019ll\nactually want to take with. Its small size doesn\u2019t mean small sound, however,\nas the speaker gets extremely loud and sounds great. While it can\u2019t match the\nbass response of larger speakers like the [UE Boom\n3](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ultimate-ears-boom-3) or the [Bose\nSoundLink Revolve](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/bose-soundlink-revolve),\nthe improved bass adds warmth and intensity to music that the original was\nlacking.\n\nAll said, for $100 (\u00a390 AU$129), the UE Wonderboom 2 is still one of the best\nwaterproof speakers you can buy - and our recommended option for those looking\nto bring their speaker to the beach or pool.\n\n**Read the full review:**[UE Wonderboom 2\nreview](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ultimate-ears-wonderboom-2)\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n![bose soundlink mini\nii](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\nbose soundlink mini ii (Image credit: Bose)\n\n### 7\\. Bose SoundLink Mini II\n\nThe best mid-range speaker\n\n **Weight:** 1.5 pounds | **Dimensions:** 2 x 7.1 x 2.3 inches (H x W x D) |\n**Battery life:** Up to 10 hours | **Wireless range:** 30 ft (10 m) |\n**Frequency response:** N/A | **Drivers:** N/A | **NFC:** No | **Bluetooth\nversion:** N/A | **Aux-in:** Yes | **USB charging:** No\n\nStellar sound\n\nBuilt like a tank\n\nCompact form factor\n\nNot water resistant\n\nThe Bose SoundLink Mini II is relatively ancient, having been released in June\n2015. However, writing off the SoundLink Mini II because of its age would be a\nmistake, as it remains one of the best sounding wireless speakers.\n\nThat said, it punches way above what its size would suggest, producing deep\nbass, sparkling highs and a lush midrange. While most wireless speakers sound\nOK, the Mini II proves that small speakers don\u2019t need to compromise on sound,\nand other Bose conveniences like a charging pad.\n\n**Read the full review:**[Bose SoundLink Mini II\nreview](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/bose-soundlink-mini-ii)\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n![Sony SRS-XB501G](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Sony)\n\n### 8\\. Sony SRS-XB501G\n\nThe ultimate party speaker with Google Assistant built right in\n\n **Weight:** 6 lb 14 oz | **Battery life:** 12 hours | **Wireless range:**\nApprox. 98 ft | **Frequency response:** 20 - 20,000Hz | **Drivers:** 45mm |\n**NFC:** Yes | **Aux-in:** N/A | **USB charging:** No\n\nPortable party speaker\n\nPowerful, spacious sound\n\nLights aren't synchronized\n\nAverage voice detection\n\nThe SRS-XB501G is a big speaker that offers a light show, tripod mount, big\nsound, and [Google Assistant](https://www.techradar.com/how-to/google-\nassistant-how-to-make-your-google-home-speaker-work-for-you). This is a\nspeaker that you can truly use on the go and in the home after a day of\npartying. On the go, the speaker is brilliant, playing loudly and for up to 16\nhours. But at home, it\u2019s dated design and average voice detection are\ncompromises compared to dedicated home speakers.\n\nCompetitors like the [_LG PK7_](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lg-\npk7-portable-bluetooth-speaker) sounds slightly better and has a light show\nthat actually reacts to your music, however it doesn\u2019t have the Google\nAssistant built in. If you\u2019re looking for an actual portable speaker that you\ncan fit in a bag that also supports Google Assistant, the [_JBL Link\n20_](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/jbl-link-20-google-assistant-smart-\nspeaker) is a good choice. Just don\u2019t expect it to pump out as much bass or\noffer as wide of a soundstage.\n\nTo that end, the XB501G is a good all-around compromise that fills multiple\npurposes. It's not the [best wireless\nspeaker](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-speaker), nor the [best smart\nspeaker](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-smart-speakers), but it's a solid\nentry in both categories and one of a select few to exist in both camps.\n\n **Read the full review:**[Sony SRS-XB501G\nreview](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/sony-srs-xb501g-portable-wireless-\nspeaker)\n\n _[Update: Sony\u2019s annual Bluetooth speaker upgrades have rolled out as it with\nthe_[ _new Sony SRS-XB23, SRS-XB33 and SRS-XB43\nspeakers_](https://www.techradar.com/news/sonys-2020-portable-bluetooth-\nspeaker-lineup-brings-the-bass-with-side-firing-subwoofers) _._\n\n _The big changes to the portable speaker lineup include the removal of the\nstrobe LED lights from last year in exchange for less-aggressive pulsing LED\nstrips and new passive radiators on the sides that Sony says will help the\nspeaker sound clearer and punchier in the low-end.]_\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n![bose soundlink\nrevolve](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Bose)\n\n### 9\\.

It\u2019s great for sharing music during a party or for\nmoving around the room without losing audio fidelity. However, the [Bose\nSoundLink Mini II](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/bose-soundlink-mini-ii)\nsounds slightly better and is slightly cheaper to boot.\n\nOn the debit side, it\u2019s also not fully dust or waterproof so you\u2019ll want to\nthink twice before bringing the Revolve to the beach.\n\nFor half the price, the [Wonderboom](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ue-\nwonderboom) is a great speaker that is completely dust and waterproof and\nwhile it can\u2019t match the audio fidelity or features of the Bose, it's still\ngreat for on-the-go listening. If bass is your game, the [JBL Charge\n4](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/hi-fi-and-audio/hi-fi-and-\nav-speakers/jbl-charge-3-bluetooth-speaker-1324500/review) is an excellent\nfully waterproof speaker that sounds great, but is big and heavy along with\nit.\n\n **Read the full review:**[Bose SoundLink Revolve\nreview](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/bose-soundlink-revolve)\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n![beosound a1](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Bang & Olufsen)\n\n### 10\\.

A marked improvement\nover its predecessor, there's better battery life, and waterproofing, although\nwe're not so sure how much we'd like to take it outside the home.\n\nWith a consistently crisp sound and a chic design, the Beosound A1 is still a\nfine example of why Bang & Olufsen's good reputation precedes it.\n\n **Read more:** [Bang & Olufsen Beosound A1 (2nd\nGen)](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/bang-and-olufsen-beosound-a1-2nd-gen)\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n![Denon envaya](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Denon)\n\n### 11\\.

It offers powerful, room-filling sound that will sound great to most ears,\nplus comes with an IP67 rating, make it both dust and waterproof. It's also\nbuilt like a tank, making it one of the most durable speakers we've ever laid\nour hands on.\n\nDespite a nearly flawless performance, the Envaya isn't perfect: While sound\nquaity is full, powerful and rich, it doesn\u2019t have the treble bite some like\nand the buttons located along the side can feel stiff and difficult to\noperate. These are ultimately minor complaints, however, and the Denon Envaya\nremains a great Bluetooth speaker \u2013 easily among the best you can buy this\nyear.\n\n **Read the full review:**[Denon Envaya (DSB-250BT)\nreview](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/denon-envaya-dsb-250bt)\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n![urbanista\nbrisbane](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\n\n### 12\\.

Loud and rich-sounding, it's a\nwell-priced addition to anyone's home, with a good battery life and the option\nto pair it with another Brisbane for true stereo sound.\n\nFor the price, the Urbanista Brisbane is ultimately a bit of a bargain. You'll\nfind better sound quality out there, but it'll cost you a lot more. All in\nall, this mid-range speaker could be a great choice for anyone who wants the\nfreedom of wireless listening without sacrificing volume levels.\n\n **Read the full review:** [Urbanista Brisbane\nreview](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403190343/https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/urbanista-\nbrisbane)\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n![1more portable bluetooth\nspeaker](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: 1MORE)\n\n### 13\\. 1MORE Portable BT Speaker\n\nA luxurious Bluetooth speaker for the office and the home\n\n **Weight:** 268g | **Battery life:** 12 hours | **Wireless range:** N/A |\n**Frequency response:** N/A | **Drivers:** N/A | **NFC:** No | **Aux-in:** Yes\n| **USB charging:** Yes\n\nGreat sound quality for the size\n\nImpressive bass response at low volume\n\nLimited IPX4 rating\n\nAverage battery life\n\nThe 1MORE Portable BT Speaker sounds great for the price.
