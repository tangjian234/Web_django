Cons\n\n## Cut the Cord\n\nWireless speakers are everywhere these days. Big, small, portable, expensive,\ncheap, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi...the sheer amount of choice can seem overwhelming.\nBut our top picks are sure to have at least one speaker that's right for you.\nBefore anything else, though, you need to decide how you want to go wireless.\n\n## Bluetooth vs. Wi-Fi Speakers\n\nBluetooth is the most common wireless music streaming standard, but it isn't\nthe only one. Bluetooth is a point-to-point wireless system, pairing a\ntransmitter (your phone or computer) with a receiver (your speaker) to play\nmusic. It's very direct and easy to set up, and can stream pretty high-quality\nmusic thanks to technological advancements that have greatly improved audio\nfidelity over what it was a few years ago. Bluetooth generally doesn't have\nany multi-room tricks in itself, though some speakers can set up stereo pairs\nwith the help of an app, while others can create a wireless mesh among\nmultiple speakers for multi-room audio. It isn't quite as high-fidelity or as\npowerful as Wi-Fi multi-room audio, however.\n\nWi-Fi audio includes standards like Apple AirPlay and Google Cast, along with\nvarious manufacturers' own Wi-Fi streaming platforms. Wi-Fi can handle more\nbandwidth than Bluetooth, so it can support higher-fidelity audio. It can also\nintegrate into your home network, so you can easily play audio from any device\nconnected to your Wi-Fi without pairing anything.\n\nThe trade-off is that Wi-Fi music systems require a Wi-Fi network to connect\nto, so they can't be used portably with your smartphone like Bluetooth\nspeakers (though many offer Bluetooth pairing as a backup). The different Wi-\nFi standards also mean various services might or might not be available to\nstream over the device, though this is less of a problem than it has been in\nthe past thanks to Google Cast and Sonos' lengthy lists of supported third-\nparty services. It's worth noting that the new Sonos Move supports Wi-Fi and\nBluetooth streaming, so compatibility isn't an issue at all.\n\n### The Best Wireless and Bluetooth Speaker Deals This Week*\n\n  * [ Echo Studio High-Fidelity Smart Speaker With Philips Hue Bulb ](https://www.pcmag.com/otc/01r1WRIAJykbQgN4oGQ8FSi/05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0849HZ86Y%2F&t=roundup-page&m=roundup-deals&e=&i=Echo+Studio+High-Fidelity+Smart+Speaker+With+Philips+Hue+Bulb&p=1&el=Echo+Studio+High-Fidelity+Smart+Speaker+With+Philips+Hue+Bulb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcmag.com%2Fpicks%2Fthe-best-wireless-and-bluetooth-speakers&cd2=Roundup&cd62=04J2qMlVXnCw5KN022Vht5j&cd63=00gBhCDB9W3oE8lI13U2nPq) \u2014 **$199.99** _(List Price $229.98; Save $29.99)_\n  * [ Echo Plus 2nd Gen Smart Speaker With Philips Hue Bulb ](https://www.pcmag.com/otc/01r1WRIAJykbQgN4oGQ8FSi/05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07Z6ZV54B%2F&t=roundup-page&m=roundup-deals&e=&i=Echo+Plus+2nd+Gen+Smart+Speaker+With+Philips+Hue+Bulb&p=2&el=Echo+Plus+2nd+Gen+Smart+Speaker+With+Philips+Hue+Bulb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcmag.com%2Fpicks%2Fthe-best-wireless-and-bluetooth-speakers&cd2=Roundup&cd62=0030BEoWjASn2v5wscNxIO5&cd63=07g18cfkY59Rs5m66rlaWGB) \u2014 **$79.99** _(List Price $179.98; Save $99.99)_\n  * [ JBL Flip 5 Portable Bluetooth Speaker ](https://www.pcmag.com/otc/01r1WRIAJykbQgN4oGQ8FSi/05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07QK2SPP7%2F&t=roundup-page&m=roundup-deals&e=&i=JBL+Flip+5+Portable+Bluetooth+Speaker&p=3&el=JBL+Flip+5+Portable+Bluetooth+Speaker&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcmag.com%2Fpicks%2Fthe-best-wireless-and-bluetooth-speakers&cd2=Roundup&cd62=00FFe2G16XQU9YKnwFkhppc&cd63=03LzSVMykmKdo0XffgiHgWj) \u2014 **$119.95** _(List Price $139.93; Save $19.98)_\n\n*Deals are selected by our partner, [TechBargains](https://www.techbargains.com/)\n\nMost new speakers available feature some kind of wireless support, whether\nthey're clip-on bike speakers or big\n[soundbars](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-soundbars). With some\nexceptions, any speaker you pick up at an electronics store will be able to\nstream audio either over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Your speaker might even be able\nto handle both wireless methods. Check if your Wi-Fi speaker has a Bluetooth\nmode for using it on the go.\n\n![Sonos\nOne](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20432'%3E%3Crect%20fill='%23f7f7f7'%20/%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n## Multi-Room Audio\n\nIf you want sound throughout your home, you're going to need more than one\nspeaker. Instead of juggling Bluetooth pairing with each one or physically\ncarrying a speaker from room to room, a multi-room sound system is the way to\ngo. Fortunately, multi-room audio is more common and easier to use than ever.\nMulti-room audio is exactly what it sounds like: playing audio in multiple\nrooms. It means a system can manage multiple speakers at once, playing from\none or more sound sources to one or more speakers at a given time.\n\nSonos speakers like the Sonos One (along with Ikea Symfonisk speakers made in\ncollaboration with Sonos) tap into the Sonos app to let you access any or all\nspeakers connected to your home network and play music from dozens of\ndifferent streaming sources, or local storage.\n\n **[See How We Test Speakers](https://www.pcmag.com/about/how-we-test-\nspeakers)**\n\nApple's AirPlay platform is the iOS- and OSX-friendly multi-room sound\nsolution. There aren't any first-party AirPlay speakers besides the Apple\nHomePod, but many other Wi-Fi speakers, including Sonos products, support\nAirPlay. They let you easily stream from your iPhone or iPad at better quality\nthan Bluetooth, but if you're an Android user, you won't find much utility in\nit.\n\nGoogle Cast is Google's answer to AirPlay, and works similarly. Google\nHome/Nest devices support Google Cast, as do many Wi-Fi speakers and\nsoundbars. Any Google Cast speaker can be incorporated into your Google Home\nsetup, including support for room-based groupings in the same app as your\nGoogle Assistant speakers and smart home devices (if you use Google Home for\nthat).\n\nAmazon Echo speakers and the Alexa voice assistant didn't originally support\nmulti-room audio, but the Echo/Alexa platform has been updated and now most\nrecent Alexa speakers can be grouped together and arranged like any other\nmulti-room system. Like Google Cast, setting up multi-room Echo audio is\nperformed through the same app as your voice assistant and smart home devices,\nonly it's all Alexa instead of Google.\n\nFinally, a few Bluetooth speakers support linking, chaining, and mesh networks\nthat connect multiple speakers to each other. These usually aren't as complex\nor robust as Wi-Fi multi-room systems, but they're a simple option that can\nprovide an alternative to using your home network to stream music.\n\n## What Kind of Speaker Do You Want?\n\nBesides the type of wireless connection, you need to think about what style of\nspeaker you want. Smaller, battery-powered speakers (usually Bluetooth) are\nuseful because you can take them anywhere, but they don't get particularly\nloud. Larger speakers generally offer fuller sound and richer bass, but they\ncan be more expensive and are often not portable.\n\nBesides single speakers, you can also find [stereo pairs designed for desktop\ncomputers](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-computer-speakers) and home\ntheater speaker systems like soundbars, soundplates, and home-theaters-in-a-\nbox. These speakers are obviously not portable at all, but if you want a\ncenterpiece sound system for your living room or office they're likely your\nbest choice.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20432'%3E%3Crect%20fill='%23f7f7f7'%20/%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n## Portability\n\nFor a speaker to be portable, it needs to both be small and light enough to\neasily carry around, and be equipped with a battery so it can run without\nbeing plugged in. Of course, \"small\" and \"light\" are relative; tiny speakers\nwith carabiners let you clip them to your backpack and take them on hikes,\nwhile much bigger and heavier speakers might be intended only to be taken from\nroom to room in your home.\n\nBluetooth speakers are usually portable, but they don't have to be. If a\nBluetooth speaker is too big to easily carry around, or doesn't have a\nbattery, it won't be portable.\n\nSince Wi-Fi speakers rely on a separate network to enable multi-speaker and\nmulti-room audio playback, they're rarely portable. After all, portability\ndoesn't matter if you need to be connected to your home's hotspot. There are\nexceptions, though, and Wi-Fi speakers can still be portable if they have\nbatteries, and ideally can create an ad-hoc Wi-Fi network with your phone.\n\n## Durability\n\nNot all portable speakers are built to be carried around outdoors, or used by\nthe pool. Rugged speakers can handle splashes, dunks, drops, and gunk and keep\nrunning. If you try that with the non-rugged speakers on this list, however,\nyou'll find yourself with a brick instead of an audio device. Look for\nspeakers with IPX ratings and guarantees of water and shock resistance if you\nwant to carry them around to the beach, the lake, the slopes, or the sewers.\nOur [guide to IP ratings](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/dust-resistant-\nwaterproof-making-sense-of-gadget-ratings) explains what those numbers mean,\nso you can know whether your speaker can handle getting dunked in the pool, or\nif it simply will stay intact in a light drizzle.\n\nFor more, see our list of [the best outdoor\nspeakers](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-outdoor-speakers).\n\n## Bluetooth Audio Quality\n\nUnless portability is at the top of your priority list, sound quality is\nparamount. Plenty of speakers don't offer much in the way of features, but\nproduce top-notch audio. Big bass isn't for everyone, but unless your speaker\nis downright tiny, it should be able to reproduce low frequencies accurately\nwithout distorting at high volumes. Clarity is more important than sheer\npower, and a balanced, clean sound should be your goal when shopping for a\nspeaker. If you want a sound system that can drive a whole party instead of\njust fill a small room, keep the size of the speaker in mind; generally, the\nbigger a speaker is, the louder it can get while still sounding good.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, in the early days of wireless audio Bluetooth was far\ninferior to Wi-Fi standards because of limited bandwidth and audio\ncompression. Those problems have been largely solved, and Bluetooth 4.0 (not\nto mention 5.0) and its relevant audio codecs can transmit excellent quality\naudio. Wi-Fi can still get an edge purely due to the available bandwidth, and\nif you want to listen to lossless music on services like Tidal you should\nprobably go with Wi-Fi over Bluetooth. Of course, a wired connection can be\nbetter than both thanks to either faster data speeds for digital signals or\nsimply the fact that the wire is carrying the analog sound without any\nconversion. But this guide is for wireless speakers.\n\n![Amazon\nEcho](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20432'%3E%3Crect%20fill='%23f7f7f7'%20/%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n## Voice Assistants\n\nVoice assistants let you simply tell your speaker what to play instead of\nlooking through your smartphone. They were initially very limited, closed\nsystems only available on first-party devices, like Alexa on the Amazon Echo\nand Google Assistant on the [Google\nHome](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/google-home), but that's steadily\nchanging. More and more third-party speakers are integrating some form of\nvoice assistant, either Google Assistant or Alexa.\n\nThese voice assistants are useful for more than just playing music. You can\nask them for weather forecasts, sports scores, unit conversions, and even\nlanguage translation. They also generally support third-party skills that let\nyou do anything from order pizza to play trivia games. If you have other\n[smart home devices](https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-best-smart-home-devices-\nfor-2020), you might even be able to integrate them as well, letting you\ncontrol the lights and thermostat with your voice.\n\nVoice assistant speakers have one universal requirement: Wi-Fi. They need an\ninternet connection, and without one voice recognition and all of the\nprocessing needed to find your music, answer your questions, and control your\nsmart home devices simply won't work. These speakers can still be portable,\nand even offer Bluetooth connectivity when you're away from your network, but\nthose features aren't certain. The most prominent first-party voice assistant\nspeakers like the Amazon Echo and the Google Home don't have batteries.\n\nFor more, see our picks for the [best smart\nspeakers](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-smart-speakers).\n\n## Price\n\nSpeakers come in a wide range of prices. Don't assume, however, that the most\nmoney always buys the best overall product. Generally speaking, higher-end\nmodels do sound better, but sometimes they lack the features you might expect\nfor the price. The trick is to get the best sound, along with the features you\nwant, at a price you can afford. And, of course, if you want to know about all\nof those things, you can read our reviews of each speaker.\n\nThe easiest way to get the best price: Shop around online. You'll often find\nprices well below list if you do a little bargain hunting on the web. Don't be\nafraid to look for similar speakers to the ones on this list, either; a number\nof the options included here have solid predecessors that you can now find for\nmuch less since they've been replaced.
