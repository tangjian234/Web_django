It is a market which\nis actually over-saturated with products so you won't find one hard to come\nby. When the market is literally littered with choices it can be harder to\nnavigate especially if you are shopping online so here are some of your top\nquestions we have answered for your information.\n\n### What to look for in Bluetooth Speakers Under $100?\n\nWhat to look for is entirely dependent on your individual requirements.\nPreferences will vary from one person to the next, but aside from the\nglaringly obvious Bluetooth connectivity availability there are some useful,\nbut not essential requirements. Firstly the ability to connect multiple\ndevices at once is highly advantageous. This provides users the ability to\nseamlessly switch between transmitting devices at their command. You will want\nto make sure it has the most current Bluetooth technology on-board to cater to\nmodern gadgets more efficiently.\n\nIf you travel a lot then battery-powered Bluetooth speakers are a handy\nsolution for audio amplification on the go. Luckily the majority of speakers\ndesigned specifically for Bluetooth use are rechargeable by default so this\nshouldn't be too tough to cover.\n\nNaturally, if you are going to take your speaker out and about with you-you\nwill want to ensure you pick a model with quality manufacturing, durable\ncompound, nuts and a robust overall design concept.\n\nMany Bluetooth speakers have water-resistant properties to combat the rain and\naccidental spillages some even cover full-submersion safety measures to\nreinforce their products portability.\n\nOther things to consider with regards to sound quality are whether it has\ndedicated drivers for the different ends of the frequency spectrum. If it is\nunequipped to deal with bass it will inevitably buzz and distort. Likewise,\nthe high frequency response will be better if it has a dedicated tweeter.\n\n### Can you get good quality Bluetooth speakers for under $100?\n\nYou would be surprised at what $100 can get you on the market these days,\nmodern advancements technological developments and mass fabrication all play\nan important part in lowering production costs on the whole.\n\nHigh end speakers with Bluetooth capabilities are always going to provide a\nbetter quality of sound than a budget option but there are plenty around that\nwon't disappoint.\n\nThe main beneficial convenience that Bluetooth model speakers provide is a\ncompact size and portable nature that allows for listening to devices aloud\nwith a richer sound than the devices internal speakers are capable of. They\ntypically have properties which are better for traveling audio needs or\noutdoor relaxing.\n\nTypically the real audiophiles out there aren't going to kick back and listen\noutdoors or on the go via their blue tooth devices as they will probably own a\nhigh end set of speakers for their own leisurely enjoyment.\n\n### Best waterproof Bluetooth speakers under $100\n\nThe majority of our reviewed Bluetooth speakers in this article have water\nresistant properties making it a very tough one to call. Some of the\nwaterproof items are IPX5 classified and others feature IPX7 certified designs\nso these are arguably more waterproofed than the rest. From those at the top\nof their game in this price region, we would say choice for best waterproof\nBluetooth is undeniably narrowed down to the Flip 4 from JBL or another option\nis the Sony XB10 but it isn't quite as loud as the JBL and you need to\npurchase 2 for stereo sound.\n\nRemember if you are wanting louder volume levels the JBL speakers can be\nmulti-linked and for a budget of $100 dollars, you can get 2 to start you off.\n\n### Best value Bluetooth speakers under $100\n\nWithout a shadow of a doubt the best value out of all of our reviews is the\nDoss which unexpectedly manages to pack a great punch in comparison to some of\nthe other products listed and it comes in at a price of around 25 bucks which\nis unreal, of course, it is often subject to fluctuation but it undercuts all\nthe rest. IT is so low priced and simply put beats all expectations, making it\nundoubtedly another great front-runner for best Bluetooth speaker.\n\nThe best sound value in direct relation to the money spent from our reviews\ntoday, our clear favorite is the Photive M90. It has 20watts of power a\n[dedicated subwoofer ](https://musiccritic.com/equipment/best-budget-\nsubwoofer/)that really packs a punch.
