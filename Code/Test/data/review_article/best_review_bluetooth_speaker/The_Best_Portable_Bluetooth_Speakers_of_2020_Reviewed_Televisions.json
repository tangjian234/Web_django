The newest addition\u2014the Flip 5\u2014brings all the\nsame great features as its forebears: solid, room-filling sound; IPX7 water-\nresistance (meaning it should survive a quick dunk in the pool without\nincident); long battery life; and a massive range of color options, from\n\"sand\" to \"squad.\"\n\nOne of the biggest upgrades for the Flip 5 includes the convenience of USB-C\ncharging (the previous Flip 4 uses micro-USB), but it also adds a newer\nBluetooth standard (4.2), improved battery (12 hours per charge), bigger\nspeaker drivers, and comes equipped with a sleep timer.\n\nThe additions mean the Flip 5 is a bit larger and heavier than the Flip 4, but\nfear not: it\u2019s still capped with reinforced rubber and wrapped in JBL\u2019s\nhandsome, rounded speaker grills, meaning it\u2019s fairly robust and it also\nsounds better than ever. Just don\u2019t drop it on your beach-going toesies.\n\nThe Flip 5 isn\u2019t the biggest, loudest speaker on our list, nor is it the most\naffordable. It is, however, an A-plus all-rounder, checking off all the right\nboxes for a portable, all-terrain Bluetooth speaker.\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * Solid sound \n\n  * Waterproof \n\n  * Rugged \n\n#### Cons\n\n  * Kind of heavy \n\n[ $59.00 from Amazon\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QK2SPP7?tag=reviewedcom03-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1?gen=untracked&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n[ $119.95 from Walmart\n](https://goto.walmart.com/c/50053/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=870189368&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F870189368?gen=untracked&retailer=walmart&source=walmart)\n[ $119.99 from Target\n](https://goto.target.com/c/50053/201333/2092?prodsku=76486323&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fjbl-\nportable-waterproof-speaker-\nflip-5-black%2F-%2FA-76486323&intsrc=APIG_1444?gen=untracked&retailer=target&source=target)\n[ $119.95 from Abt\n](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7049598-13489155-1594740832499?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.abt.com%2Fproduct%2F134698%2FJBL-\nFlip-5-Midnight-Black-Wireless-Portable-Waterproof-Speaker-\nJBLFLIP5BLKAM.html&cjsku=134698?gen=untracked&retailer=abt&source=abt)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n![Anker-Soundcore-2](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nByZ6h3Ki--/b_white,c_limit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,q_1,w_792/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/attachment/1621d8e30cf64ab1/DSC_0726.jpg)\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser\n\n![](/packs/media/images/best-value-b0b37f0f8b6096b0abb23f3ff8b23fb2.png)\n\nThe very affordable, very practice Anker Soundcore 2 is one of the most\nvaluable Bluetooth speakers on the market.\n\nBest Value\n\nAnker Soundcore 2\n\nThe latest iteration in Anker's SoundCore portable speaker line, the SoundCore\n2 is basic, straightforward, and useful. It features a sturdy rectangular\ndesign with big, easy-to-push buttons and a very tightly sealed set of inputs\nfor USB charging and a 3.5 input.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the SoundCore 2 was its sound quality. For\nbeing small, portable, and fairly lightweight, it has less tinniness in the\ntreble than a lot of portable Bluetooth speakers and more bass presence, too.\nBetween the low price point and the wide array of colors, it's a very clear\nvalue pick as far as portable speakers go. It doesn't get super loud, but it\npumps out as much sound as most people need, and all without a touch of\naudible distortion.\n\nLast but definitely not least, the Anker SoundCore 2 is, of course, rated IPX7\nwater-resistant, meaning it's been tested for 30 minutes in one meter of\nwater. In other words, like JBL's Flip 5, it's very splashproof and should\nalso be good for a quick dunk without being rendered useless.\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * Easy to use \n\n  * Portable \n\n  * Affordable \n\n#### Cons\n\n  * Nothing we could find \n\n[ $39.99 from Amazon\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTB55WH?tag=reviewedcom03-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1?gen=untracked&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n\n## Related content\n\n  * ![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--wYWL6ULb--/b_white,c_fill,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_200/https://reviewed-production.s3.amazonaws.com/1537447174938/besttvhero.png)\n\n####  ![](/packs/media/images/icon-\nexclamation-859a51cf17b617432be0b49db97b8488.svg) best-right-now\n\n[ The Best TVs of 2020 ](https://www.reviewed.com/televisions/best-right-\nnow/best-televisions)\n\n  * ![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--84Gpnjxh--/b_white,c_fill,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_200/https://reviewed-production.s3.amazonaws.com/1594228124000/Sony-A8H-OLED-Hero.jpg)\n\n####  ![](/packs/media/images/icon-check-small-\nba6422ca58d1b21605214cdee5a81fef.svg) review\n\n[ Sony A8H OLED TV Review\n](https://www.reviewed.com/televisions/content/sony-a8h-oled-tv-review)\n\n## How We Tested\n\n![How-We-Tested](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\n8XOCNmYa--/b_white,c_limit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,q_1,w_792/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/attachment/7cce312752614e83/DSC_0734.jpg)\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser\n\nTesting involved some deep listening, but also just a lot of just hanging out\nwith tons of speakers at home and outside.\n\n### The Tester\n\nHowdy, I'm Lee Neikirk, Home Theater Editor for Reviewed and casual\nvideo/audiophile. I've been elbows-deep in professional reviews of video and\naudio products for the last 7 years, but before that, I was earning a degree\nin music performance, so it's safe to say that audio quality and presentation\nare passions of mine. At home, I utilize guitar amplifiers, studio monitors\nfor music mastering, and a sound \"plate\" for my TV. But nothing is more\ndelightful than a compact, rugged, or waterproof speaker that can fill space\nwith music; it's like magic!\n\n### The Tests\n\nTesting for these portable Bluetooth speakers was a fairly simple process. I\ntook a big box of them home and over a few weeks, sampled and used them in\ndifferent locations in my home. I didn't do any objective testing for audio\nquality, but I did listen to them closely, comparing them to a range of other\nspeaker sources, as well as headphones.\n\nBut perhaps just as important (if not more important) than checking out each\nspeaker's audio quality was simply using it like the average person would:\nconnecting over Bluetooth, setting it up on a desk or table, and listening to\nmusic. I'd crank the speakers up to max to check for distortion or buzzing,\nand cycle through each speaker's various functions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSometimes speakers sounded great at every volume, connected immediately, had\nresponsive buttons and stylized Bluetooth feedback, and so on. Sometimes they\npresented a chintzy or questionable experience. The final ranking represents a\nrough approximation of those traits alongside the cost/value of the speaker.\nAs time has gone on, our staff has also tested new speakers using the same\nprocess, ranked them, and added them to the list.\n\n## What You Should Know About Portable Bluetooth Speakers\n\nTechnically, a portable Bluetooth speaker is any speaker that you can connect\nto wirelessly over Bluetooth connection, has a battery for powering on away\nfrom outlets, and is small/light enough to be carried with you or stowed in a\nbag.\n\nWhile this can include a very wide range of speaker types and price points,\ngenerally portable Bluetooth speakers fall between $30 and $200 in price and\ninclude a suite of key features like Bluetooth connectivity (duh), volume\nadjustment, 3.5mm aux input, and micro USB charging.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFeatures like splash resistance or waterproofing, a rugged exterior, LED\nindicators, and bass boosting vary depending on the model\u2014those kinds of\nthings are usually what you\u2019re paying more for. But you can always safely\nassume any portable Bluetooth speaker you buy will be wireless and work with\nwhatever type of phone you have.\n\n### How Loud Are Bluetooth Speakers?\n\nAnother key thing to understand about portable Bluetooth speakers is that\nthey\u2019re more of a replacement for your smartphone than for traditional home\ntheater speakers or even soundbars.\n\nAlthough you can get really big, boombox style portable speakers that might be\nable to blow the roof off a house party, most of the speakers we tested aren\u2019t\namazingly loud. They\u2019re loud enough to provide music for a small gathering or\na modest backyard get together, but if you\u2019re in the raucous throes of a\nparty, most of these will be drowned out.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhere this starts to matter more is when you\u2019re using one of these speakers in\nan on-the-go situation. Because of the relatively low power of most of the\nspeakers here, using them outside on a windy beach or hanging from your\nhandlebars as you pedal through the woods may not always yield crystal clear\naudio. But you\u2019ll know music is playing, and that\u2019s probably as good as you\u2019re\ngoing to get without using headphones.\n\nAs for audio quality, one reason these speakers don\u2019t get mega loud is that if\nthey did, it would introduce distortion. Instead, engineers have capped the\nrelative output to maintain clarity, which is a smart move both for your\nlistening enjoyment and for the life of the soldered wires inside.\n\n### What about water resistance?\n\nMany portable Bluetooth speakers are splash and/or water-resistant on top of\nbeing extra-rugged or capped with rubber components to help protect them from\nfalls.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut it can be a little hard to know if it\u2019s safe to \u201caccidentally\u201d boot your\nlittle speaker into the pool when a song you hate comes on, so check [this\nguide to the ranking](https://www.audioreputation.com/ipx-ratings-explained/)\nsystem if you\u2019re really curious.\n\n* * *\n\n## Other Portable Bluetooth Speakers We Tested\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\n7574oyHX--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_150/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1592323585172/JBL-Boombox-2.jpg)\n\nJBL Boombox 2\n\nIf you want the biggest, loudest, most party-rocking Bluetooth speaker you can\nbuy, JBL\u2019s Boombox 2 wrote the book on \u201cin your face.\u201d In all seriousness, as\nwith many JBL speakers the Boombox 2 is immaculately designed\u2014rounded, robust,\nand heavy\u2014and it has the audio presence to match its hefty size. While most of\nthe speakers on this list are around the size of a soda can, the JBL Boombox 2\nis a\u2026 well, you see, it\u2019s a boombox. A dyed-in-the-wool, walk-down-the-street-\nwith-it-on-your-shoulder boombox.\n\nThere are a lot of places where a smaller, more traditional Bluetooth speaker\nmight serve you better. I used the Boombox 2 for several weeks while waiting\non other Bluetooth speakers to arrive for evaluation. As it serenaded us in\nour kitchen every day, I probably never set the volume to more than 50% of its\nmaximum. This Bluetooth speaker is very, very loud\u2014that said, it also sounds\nreally good, featuring more than ample bass presence and good clarity across\nthe frequency spectrum. It sounds good, and it fills even the most cavernous\nrooms, easily heard over party conversation, surging ocean waves, or the buzz\nof nearby power tools.\n\nIt\u2019s also rugged, waterproof, and designed with covered ports, meaning you can\ntote it just about anywhere (within reason). And with JBL\u2019s \u201cPartyBoost\u201d\nfeature, you can even add in additional JBL speakers (though why you\u2019d need\nto, I\u2019m not sure).\n\nSo why isn\u2019t this the #1 Bluetooth speaker? Simply put, it\u2019s just too much for\nmost people, even if it\u2019s too much of a good thing. It\u2019s (relatively) huge,\nheavy, expensive, and will offer diminishing returns for casual, everyday\nsituations. However, if you\u2019ve got the funds and want a Bluetooth speaker that\ncan be nuanced enough for a low-key night in and loud enough that they\u2019ll hear\nit on Mars, this is the one to get.\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * Majorly loud \n\n  * Extremely durable \n\n  * Good features \n\n#### Cons\n\n  * Expensive \n\n  * Overkill for most people \n\n[ $499.95 from Amazon\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086C14ZPY?tag=reviewedcom03-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1?gen=untracked&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n[ $499.95 from Walmart\n](https://goto.walmart.com/c/50053/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=628906253&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F628906253?gen=untracked&retailer=walmart&source=walmart)\n[ $499.95 from Abt\n](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7049598-13489155-1594740832439?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.abt.com%2Fproduct%2F147009%2FJBL-\nBoombox-2-Black-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker-\nJBLBOOMBOX2BLKAM.html&cjsku=147009?gen=untracked&retailer=abt&source=abt) [\n$499.99 from Best Buy ](https://knl.mntzrlt.net/shop-\nrest/api/track/v2/1049/5/11909?oi=5815434853&xp=11&mk=USD_EN&tu=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6400615%2Fpdp?gen=untracked&retailer=bestbuy&source=skimlinks)\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\ni3z4uZ4R--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_150/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1592323612466/Marshall-Stockwell-II.jpg)\n\nMarshall Stockwell II\n\nIt\u2019d be almost tongue-in-cheek to say that famed guitar amp aficionado\nMarshall \u201cknows how to make a speaker,\u201d but that\u2019s also what the company is\ncounting on with its lineup of portable Bluetooth speakers.\n\nThe Marshall Stockwell II, which not only bears the classic \u201cMarshall\u201d logo\nright on its front grill, it\u2019s designed to look like a little guitar amp. The\nthree physical knobs on top for \u201cvolume,\u201d \u201cbass,\u201d and \u201ctreble\u201d are heavily\nreminiscent of amplifier knobs (though, unfortunately, they don\u2019t go to 11).\nThe carrying strap leans into this bit of camp, too: it\u2019s a short, faux-\nleather band that connects to either side of the amp\u2014er, Bluetooth speaker\u2014by\nway of classic guitar strap hooks, resplendent in gold finish.\n\nIf all this musical paraphernalia is your bag, you\u2019re going to love this\nthing. If not, you\u2019ll still be glad to know that the amp-esque design details\naren\u2019t at all superficial. The Stockwell II is one of the sturdiest-feeling\nBluetooth speakers I\u2019ve ever handled: the front and back feature metal-lined\nspeaker grills, while the rounded, rectangular body is made of the same super-\ndurable material you\u2019ll find on many guitar amps.\n\nAnd while most people will probably just find an EQ/volume setting they like\nand never touch the knobs again, you\u2019ll be glad to know they actually work,\nadding or removing bass/treble/volume to or from music splendidly. How many\nBluetooth speakers have you used that had tangible EQ controls? I\u2019ve used\nabout 40 and this is the first one I\u2019ve seen with an effective on-\nboard/physical EQ. It\u2019s an awesome addition, especially if you\u2019re finicky\nabout how your music sounds.\n\nThese souped-up design details and hyper-durable build, plus that Marshall\nbranding, mean the Stockwell II doesn\u2019t come cheap. However, it\u2019s an option\nthat\u2019s head-and-shoulders above much of the competition in terms of unique\ndesign and customization, and it sounds great, too.

At its now fairly discounted street price, it's an\nexcellent value, hands down.\n\nBecause of its tall, conical shape and heftier size, the Revolve is able to\ndisperse a lot of sound throughout the room but has enough weight to deliver\nrobust sound (including great bass/midrange sound) without introducing\ndistortion or impeding its portability. It's obviously not nearly as loud as a\nstandard bookshelf speaker, but for what it is, the Revolve produces very\ncrisp, pleasing audio. It's also got a microphone for voice prompts, which is\nadmittedly a very niche feature, but certainly a welcome one.\n\nThe Revolve is expensive, but it's priced fairly for what you get. You're\npaying a little more for the vaunted Bose label, but getting a portable\nBluetooth speaker that sounds this good is definitely worth the price for the\naudiophile crowd.\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * Great 360-degree sound \n\n  * Good feature set \n\n  * Quality materials \n\n#### Cons\n\n  * Expensive \n\n[ $148.74 from Amazon\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCQKTKR?tag=reviewedcom03-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1?gen=untracked&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n[ $199.00 from Walmart\n](https://goto.walmart.com/c/50053/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=589769498&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F589769498?gen=untracked&retailer=walmart&source=walmart)\n[ $199.99 from Target\n](https://goto.target.com/c/50053/201333/2092?prodsku=52252589&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbose-\nsoundlink-revolve-bluetooth-speaker-\nblack%2F-%2FA-52252589&intsrc=APIG_1444?gen=untracked&retailer=target&source=target)\n[ $199.00 from B&H ](https://knl.mntzrlt.net/shop-\nrest/api/track/v2/1049/5/11159?oi=3573245192&xp=11&mk=USD_EN&tu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1331925-REG%2Fbose_739523_1110_soundlink_revolve_bluetooth_speaker.html?gen=untracked&retailer=bh&source=skimlinks)\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nuVacAwrZ--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_150/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1556575498982/JBL-Flip-4.jpg)\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\ni3ff333t--/b_white,c_limit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,q_1,w_972/https://reviewed-\ncom-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nts4bj2wC--/b_white%2Cc_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive.strip_profile%2Cg_center%2Ch_122%2Cq_auto%2Cw_104/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1567516076953/editors-choice.png)\n\nJBL Flip 4\n\nThe predecessor to our current Best Overall, the JBL Flip 4 is still\navailable, and it still sounds awesome, is waterproof (IPX7), and boasts\nbeefier battery life than a lot of smaller options. Basically, it's still a\ngreat choice if you wanna save a little money versus buying the Flip 5.\n\nFrom the knock-resistant, hard-plastic chassis to the cleanly spaced volume,\nplay, and Bluetooth buttons, the Flip 4 stands out from the collective a bit\nin terms of pure polish and quality. It's not the loudest speaker on the list\nbut it provides a good balance of bass, midrange, and treble frequencies. It's\nlighter than smaller speakers, which definitely adds to its overall\nportability, and is available in a wide range of colors like blue, red, teal,\nand even camo (yikes).\n\nIf you need waterproofing, outdoorsy sturdiness, good volume, and the ability\nto connect more than one Bluetooth source at a time, the Flip 4 is one of the\nbest around. It also delivers more impressive, rumbling bass than the majority\nof speakers on this list, which is one of the hardest attributes to find in\nthe category. No matter how you plan to use it\u2014indoor, outdoor, dry, wet,\nstationary, or in motion\u2014the Flip 4 delivers the goods.\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * Good sound \n\n  * Waterproof \n\n#### Cons\n\n  * A bit expensive for its age \n\n[ $70.31 from Amazon\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSYQWNY?tag=reviewedcom03-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1?gen=untracked&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n[ $79.00 from Walmart\n](https://goto.walmart.com/c/50053/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=231555126&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F231555126?gen=untracked&retailer=walmart&source=walmart)\n[ $97.99 from Overstock ](https://knl.mntzrlt.net/shop-\nrest/api/track/v2/1049/5/602?oi=5810317747&xp=11&mk=USD_EN&tu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overstock.com%2FElectronics%2FBluetooth-\nSpeakers%2F17307%2Fsubcat.html%3Ffeaturedproduct%3D17013173%26featuredoption%3D28407245?gen=untracked&retailer=overstock&source=skimlinks)\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nMroIZ6ea--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_150/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1556576352311/Bose-SoundLink-Micro.jpg)\n\nBose SoundLink Micro\n\nIf you're looking to secure a fancier-than-average portable Bluetooth speaker,\nthe Bose SoundLink Micro delivers, but you're going to pay for it. My first\nthought when I encountered this popular little portable speaker was, \"Why is\nit so expensive? Is it worth it, or is it just because it's Bose?\"\n\nWell, yes and no. The SoundLink Micro checks off a lot of the right boxes:\nit's made of durable but touchable materials and features notably elegant\ndesign details. In fact, while most portable Bluetooth speakers of this size\nare made of cheap, hard plastic, the SoundLink Micro feels nicer in my hands\nthan, frankly, most things I've ever held. It's surprisingly soft\u2014in fact, I\nasked my co-worker to hold it, and we agreed it was straight up cuddly.\nGranted, the silicone finish is what helps the Micro to be waterproof, but it\ncertainly doubles as a silky smooth exterior.\n\nOf course, its svelte design isn't the only reason to pay more for the Micro.\nIn classic Bose fashion, the sound is more or less impeccable. However, it's\nworth noting that the Micro also costs twice as much as something like the\nAnker Soundcore 2, while delivering a similar aural presence. It's a _little_\nnicer, and it definitely sounds better, but we're not convinced that in this\nparticular product category, most folks are going to want to pay twice as much\nfor such a subtle improvement in overall quality.\n\nIf money is no object, though, this is one of the nicest portable Bluetooth\nspeakers around.\n\n[ $79.00 from Amazon\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748N1BZD?tag=reviewedcom03-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1?gen=untracked&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n[ $79.00 from Walmart\n](https://goto.walmart.com/c/50053/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=367992038&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F367992038?gen=untracked&retailer=walmart&source=walmart)\n[ $79.99 from Target\n](https://goto.target.com/c/50053/201333/2092?prodsku=52808617&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbose-\nsoundlink-micro-bluetooth-speaker-\nblack-783342-0100%2F-%2FA-52808617&intsrc=APIG_1444?gen=untracked&retailer=target&source=target)\n[ $79.00 from B&H ](https://knl.mntzrlt.net/shop-\nrest/api/track/v2/1049/5/11159?oi=5371290589&xp=11&mk=USD_EN&tu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1351459-REG%2Fbose_slbtspu_soundlink_bluetooth_speaker_purple.html?gen=untracked&retailer=bh&source=skimlinks)\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nfR-3rk9g--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_150/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1556293997908/soundcore-flare-plus.jpg)\n\nAnker Soundcore Flare+\n\nThe Flare+ lives up to its namesake. This tall, conical speaker is one of the\nonly ones I've seen to feature flashing, music-synced LED lights. It's one of\nthe larger speakers that I tested and features a handsome, deep gray\ncoloration and speaker grill, intuitive controls, and some neat features.\n\nFirst off, the Flare+ sounds really good. It's one of the bigger speakers we\ntested, and its 360-degree speaker design and sheer height/size give it a leg\nup over the smaller, more compact speakers I tested. It's easy to control, and\nif you don't like the light show you can shut it off. Personally, I'm on the\nfence about it. During use, I found the light synced up kind of weirdly to the\nmusic I was playing and didn't have the satisfying, full glow of the LEDs as\nthey appear on the box. But perhaps that's what I get for listening to late\n'80s Phil Collins.\n\nMaybe the best thing about the Flare+ is that, like many of our favorites on\nthis list, it's IPX7 water-resistant, which I definitely wouldn't expect if\nsomeone just handed it to me on the street. That means not only is it a big,\ncolorful option for your pool party but if the dog accidentally knocks it into\nthe water, it should survive the plunge. Overall, it's a most robust choice,\nwith plenty of flair to go along with it.\n\n[ $66.43 from Amazon\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F7VJN1G?tag=reviewedcom03-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1?gen=untracked&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n[ $79.00 from Walmart\n](https://goto.walmart.com/c/50053/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=390434655&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F390434655?gen=untracked&retailer=walmart&source=walmart)\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nhxhFZDyq--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_150/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1556575656666/JBL-Clip-3.jpg)\n\nJBL Clip 3\n\nJBL's \"Clip\" line of portable Bluetooth speakers have been kicking around for\nyears, and while they definitely break the mold where most Bluetooth speakers\nare concerned, they've got staying power for a reason. The tiny Clip 3 is so-\nnamed because it features a small partial carabiner clip for it to hang on\nvarious things\u2014belt loops, bike handles, shower rods, and so on. Other key\nfeatures include 10 hours of battery life per charge and IPX7 water\nresistance.\n\nFor being a tiny speaker, the Clip 3 has pretty big sound. Even without\nclipping it on anything, it fills space and plays back cleanly without\ndistortion. That said, the maximum volume isn't much, so if you're going for\nsheer volume, the Clip may not be a good choice.\n\nFor the price, however, the Clip 3 is great. At max volume, I even heard a few\nvocal lines I hadn't heard in one of my favorite songs before. It's also\navailable in a wide variety of colors, which is just downright fun.

This makes it a great choice if\nyou want to blast some tunes at the pool or on the beach without worrying\nabout water damage. We nabbed the \"volcano\" version, but it's available in a\nwide range of colors.\n\nAfter a bit of fidgeting, getting Spotify playing on the UE Roll 2 was easy.\nThere's a power button on the back of the device that puts it into Bluetooth\nmode as soon as it's on. The cross pattern on the front of the speaker has two\npressable areas that make volume adjustment simple and accessible. The device\nalso announces its \"on\" and \"paired\" status with audio feedback tones, which\nis nice.\n\nWhere sound quality is concerned, the Roll rocks pretty solidly. I noticed\ndecent bass presence, but a little excess treble, where things like snare hits\nwere notably higher in the mix than they were on my headphones. There's some\nrisk of losing out on mid-range audibility here, but overall the audio quality\nis decent for the price.\n\nThe reason the Roll 2 ranks lower than others on the list is the fact that\nit's a bit pricey for the sound you get and, frankly, the vast majority of\nspeakers we test these days boast similar water resistance. That said, it's\nstill a solid choice, and it's as easy to take along as it is to use.\n\n[ $179.69 from Amazon\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FFV59PY?tag=reviewedcom03-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1?gen=untracked&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n[ $91.95 from Walmart\n](https://goto.walmart.com/c/50053/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=54890221&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F54890221?gen=untracked&retailer=walmart&source=walmart)\n\n## More Articles You Might Enjoy\n\n  * [The Best Portable Projectors](https://www.reviewed.com/home-theater/best-right-now/the-best-portable-projectors)\n  * [The Best Soundbars Under $200](https://www.reviewed.com/televisions/best-right-now/the-best-soundbars-under-200)\n  * [The Best Portable Bluetooth Speakers Under $100 of 2019](https://www.reviewed.com/televisions/best-right-now/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers-under-100)\n  * [The Best Wireless Headphones](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/best-right-now/the-best-wireless-headphones)\n\n##  Meet the tester\n\n![Lee Neikirk](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nb16vgshG--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_160,q_1,w_160/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1546272757253/headshot-1-1-crop.jpg)\n\nLee Neikirk\n\nEditor\n\n[ @Koanshark ](https://twitter.com/Koanshark)\n\nLee has been Reviewed's point person for most television and home theater\nproducts since 2012.
