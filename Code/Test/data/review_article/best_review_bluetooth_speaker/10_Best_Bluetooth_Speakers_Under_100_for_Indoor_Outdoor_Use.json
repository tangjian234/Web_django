I\nfind it hard to argue with those statements since this tiny gadget pretty much\ncaters to any audiophile on a budget. Even snobby audiophiles have been known\nto feel surprised by the sound quality when they heard it for the first time.\n\nThe speaker has an output of 20W. That\u2019s more than impressive for its size and\nprice. Obviously, you get that unique JBL signature sound that has set a high\nstandard in the music industry for decades. The battery is beefier than ever\nat a whopping 4,800 mAh.\n\nYou can connect the speaker to two devices simultaneously (smartphones,\ntablets, etc.). This allows you to play music of different playlists and make\nsure that everyone\u2019s entertained. Although the speaker does a good job of\nbalancing the frequency spectrum and can be easily used as a cheap alternative\nto [gaming headsets](https://musicoomph.com/best-open-back-headphones-for-\ngaming/), the device truly shines in the great outdoors.\n\nWhy should you take it outside to get your money\u2019s worth? \u2013 The Flip 5 has an\nIPX7 waterproof rating. If you\u2019re no stranger to camping and survival\nequipment, then you know just how overkill this is.\n\nBut not all the money goes towards ensuring durability. The speaker can give\nyou around 12 hours of playtime, which is very good considering all the other\nfeatures. You also get compatibility with over 100 other JBL speakers if you\nwant to amplify the sound even further. You also get a USB-C fast charging\nport now.\n\nLast but not least, in terms of portability and style, you can\u2019t ask for more.\nThe end caps are now covered, which adds more durability and makes the unit\nlook sleeker. And, at 7.1\u201d x 2.7\u201d small, you can\u2019t really be concerned with\ncarrying or placing the speaker anywhere.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAgABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAACAAEAAAICBAoAOw==)\n\n  * Sleek and powerful\n  * Check Circle\n\nSuperior audio quality\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nJBL signature sound\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nIPX7 waterproof rating\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nExcellent battery life\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nUSB-C fast charging\n\n  * Check Circle\n\n50+ feet range\n\n  * Not the cleanest audio past 80dB\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\.

As with all things Bose, the speaker combines\ndecent durability and consistent sound quality, this time with a wireless\nconnection and at a bargain price.\n\nThe SoundLink boasts crisp audio and solid bass definition. If you\u2019re looking\nfor something that\u2019s designed for the outdoors, then this Bose micro speaker\nmight just be the one. It\u2019s small, light, rugged, and comes with a convenient\ntear-resistant carry strap too.\n\nIf the footprint is one of your main concerns, know that the SoundLink is just\n3.87\u201d x 3.87\u201d and 1.37\u201d tall. That\u2019s pretty much pocket-sized. The range is up\nto 30 feet. That\u2019s an approximation of how far away you can keep it while\nstill getting good audio. You may push it further if you can deal with the\nsound dropping off once in a while.\n\nThere\u2019s also a built-in speakerphone that you can use if you use a voice\nassistant like Google Assistant or Siri. The battery should last up to 6 hours\neven if you blast the speaker close to its maximum volume. This is about\naverage when you compare it to what other manufacturers offer \u2013 but not if you\ncompare to speakers of similar sizes.\n\nBluetooth pairing is enabled. For example, you can pair it with another Bose\nSoundLink to make a pair of stereo speakers (left and right).\n\nAnother impressive function is how fast the speaker recharges. And you can\nstill use it while it\u2019s charging and you won\u2019t have to worry about any\nstalling.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAgABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAACAAEAAAICBAoAOw==)\n\n  * Rugged construction\n  * Check Circle\n\nIPX7 waterproofing\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nCrisp sound\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nEnhanced bass definition\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nSpeakerphone\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nPairing enabled\n\n  * Average battery life\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. [JBL Clip\n3](https://imp.i114863.net/c/2237384/794166/11319?sharedid=MusicOomph.com&prodsku=Clip3Blk&u=https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Clip3Blk\n--jbl-lifestyle-clip-3-portable-waterproof-bluetooth-speaker-black)\n\n[![](//musicoomph.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/JBL-\nClip-3.jpg)](https://imp.i114863.net/c/2237384/794166/11319?sharedid=MusicOomph.com&prodsku=Clip3Blk&u=https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Clip3Blk\n--jbl-lifestyle-clip-3-portable-waterproof-bluetooth-speaker-black)\n\n[ View on Sweetwater\n](https://imp.i114863.net/c/2237384/794166/11319?sharedid=MusicOomph.com&prodsku=Clip3Blk&u=https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Clip3Blk\n--jbl-lifestyle-clip-3-portable-waterproof-bluetooth-speaker-black)\n\n[ View on Amazon ](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Waterproof-Portable-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker/dp/B07Q6ZWMLR/?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\nIf you\u2019re not really an audiophile but you like unique audio equipment, the\nJBL Clip 3 might make sense for you. It almost looks like a padlock and can be\nclipped onto a belt or strap. Talk about putting a soundtrack to your weekend\nhikes.\n\nThis is also one of the lightest speakers on this list. This and the clip-on\ndesign alone make it a solid choice for anyone in need of a portable speaker.\nA simple yet very clear sound gets projected from the comparatively large\ndrivers. The overall sound is neutral and balanced but the speaker sounds much\nbigger than the size. This means that the Clip 3 can handle most musical\ngenres well.\n\nAlthough small, there\u2019s no way you look at the Clip 3 and not see it as an\noutdoor speaker. Due to how it looks and how it hooks, there\u2019s not much you\ncan do with it inside the house. But, take it on a trail or to a pool party\nand you start to see its value.\n\nOne of the best things about it is the IPX7 waterproof rating. It virtually\nmakes the speaker viable in any environment. However, it doesn\u2019t have the most\ndurable casing or protection for its driver.\n\nYou can enjoy up to 10 hours of your favorite playlist. That\u2019s if you use the\nspeaker at around 50% volume.\n\nLast but not least, the speakerphone is high-end. It\u2019s not the most important\nfeature in a device that\u2019s designed to play your tunes but the echo-canceling\nfeatures deserve some recognition.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAgABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAACAAEAAAICBAoAOw==)\n\n  * Budget choice\n  * Check Circle\n\nEnhanced portability\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nIPX7 waterproofing\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nNeutral balanced sound\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nHigh-quality speakerphone\n\n  * Pairing can be slow\n  * Times Circle\n\nAverage battery life\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. [Sony XB10](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Portable-Wireless-Speaker-\nBluetooth/dp/B01N4TIRUD/?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\n[![](//musicoomph.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sony-\nXB10.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Portable-Wireless-Speaker-\nBluetooth/dp/B01N4TIRUD/?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\n[ View on Amazon ](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Portable-Wireless-Speaker-\nBluetooth/dp/B01N4TIRUD/?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\nNot only is the Sony XB10 an affordable outdoor Bluetooth speaker but it also\nhas good audio quality, whether used alone or in a stereo setup.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that the bass is slightly enhanced. Here\u2019s the thing though. All\nsmall speakers are designed to emphasize the bass and extreme high\nfrequencies. That\u2019s to compensate for human hearing, which isn\u2019t as sensitive\nto these frequencies at lower volume. It\u2019s the very basis of the V-shape\nequalizer setting.\n\nWhen this is done well, it can totally make a speaker sound much better \u2013 and\nthat\u2019s the case with the Sony XB10, which is also a very small speaker. It\u2019s\nno bigger than a coffee mug and just as. The construction seems solid and\nthere should be no issues from a few drops.\n\nThe water resistance is good against some light rain and splashes, but this is\none of those Bluetooth speakers that are better off protected against water.\n\nThe battery life should be enough for most parties at 16 hours between\ncharges. There\u2019s also not a huge drop-off if you try to push the volume to the\nmax.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAgABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAACAAEAAAICBAoAOw==)\n\n  * Affordable\n  * Check Circle\n\nCompact size\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nSome enhanced bass definition\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nGood battery life\n\n  * Not too powerful\n\n* * *\n\n### 5\\. [Tronsmart Force](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Tronsmart-\nSoundPulse-Waterproof-Dual-Driver/dp/B07MGSWD1F?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\n[![](//musicoomph.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Tronsmart-Force-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Tronsmart-SoundPulse-\nWaterproof-Dual-Driver/dp/B07MGSWD1F?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\n[ View on Amazon ](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Tronsmart-SoundPulse-\nWaterproof-Dual-Driver/dp/B07MGSWD1F?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\nTronsmart may not be at the top of anyone\u2019s list of audio equipment\nmanufacturers but the Force speaker proves that brand names may not matter as\nmuch with these speakers (perhaps because there\u2019s one country in the world\nthat can manufacture stuff for less than all other countries).\n\nThe Tronsmart Force is a 40W speaker that comes with IPX7 waterproofing, voice\nassistant support, and amazing bass definition. The speaker has three preset\nmodes which allow you to experience music just the way you want it.\n\nIf you\u2019re [all about that bass](https://musicoomph.com/best-floor-standing-\nspeakers/) then the Extra Bass mode is for you. The low frequency definition\nreally belies the size of the speaker. The 3D surround sound mode is another\ninteresting choice that manages to bring some much-needed depth to the\nstandard sound of outdoor speakers.\n\nThe speaker can also support a wide range of file formats including Flac, WAV,\nAPE, and more. You can pair the speaker to your smartphone via Bluetooth or a\nstandard 3.5mm cable connector.\n\nThis speaker also has a long-lasting battery. At 50% volume, you should be\nable to get up to 15 hours of playtime between charges.\n\nThe built-in microphone is something that I always appreciate in Bluetooth\nspeakers. And, the compatibility with most smartphone voice assistants\ncertainly adds a level of convenience to the device.\n\nLast but not least, you can connect two Tronsmart Force speakers together to\nmake [a pair of stereo speakers](https://musicoomph.com/best-bookshelf-\nspeakers/). Besides the stereo imaging and\n[soundstage](https://musicoomph.com/best-studio-monitors/), this should\nenhance the 3D equalizer mode even further and let you play even louder.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAgABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAACAAEAAAICBAoAOw==)\n\n  * Budget-friendly\n  * Check Circle\n\n98ft range\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nIPX7 waterproofing\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nTwo enhanced bass modes\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nGood battery life\n\n  * Not as durable as similar models\n\n* * *\n\n### 6\\. [Ultimate Ears Boom 2 Phantom\nEdition](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Ears-Bluetooth-Waterproof-\nShockproof/dp/B014M8ZO8S?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\n[![](//musicoomph.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ultimate-Ears-Boom-2-Phantom-\nEdition.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Ears-Bluetooth-Waterproof-\nShockproof/dp/B014M8ZO8S?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\n[ View on Amazon ](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Ears-Bluetooth-Waterproof-\nShockproof/dp/B014M8ZO8S?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\nThe Boom 2 Phantom Edition is a very interesting speaker. It has 360 degrees\nprojection like all cylindrical speakers nowadays (Amazon Echo, JBL Charge,\netc.).\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for loud and clear sound, you can\u2019t go wrong with the\nUltimate Ears Boom 2 Phantom. If this is not your first speaker, it\u2019s still a\nreliable choice for pairing or daisy-chaining. The speaker is compatible with\nalmost all Ultimate Ears wireless speakers.\n\nIf you\u2019re not already a loyal fan of this brand, you should at least give it\nmore consideration. Ultimate Ears did a good job on this model, especially\nwhen it comes to range and battery life. You can listen to up to 15 hours of\nyour favorite playlists, as long as the volume isn\u2019t turned up to max.\n\nAlong with the long battery life, you also benefit from long range. This is\none of the few speakers that can still give you a stable connection from 100ft\naway.\n\nIf you want to use the speaker at beach parties or at the campsite, another\ncool thing is that it can connect to up to eight devices at the same time.\nHowever, you can only control playlists from two devices at a time.\n\nOne thing to note is that there\u2019s no support for voice assistants. But it does\ncome with an app or you can use this the old-fashioned way. The rugged\nconstruction, good audio quality, and superior range make it a highly\ncompetent Bluetooth speaker.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAgABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAACAAEAAAICBAoAOw==)\n\n  * Rugged design\n  * Check Circle\n\nRubber spine\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nIPX7 waterproofing\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nLong battery life\n\n  * Check Circle\n\n360-degrees projection\n\n  * No built-in microphone\n\n* * *\n\n### 7\\. [Oontz Angle 3 Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/OontZ-Angle-Ultra-Hi-\nQuality-Splashproof/dp/B073BVWRSP?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\n[![](//musicoomph.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Oontz-\nAngle-3-Ultra.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/OontZ-Angle-Ultra-Hi-Quality-\nSplashproof/dp/B073BVWRSP?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\n[ View on Amazon ](https://www.amazon.com/OontZ-Angle-Ultra-Hi-Quality-\nSplashproof/dp/B073BVWRSP?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\nSome may argue that a 14W speaker is not enough to satisfy people in an open\noutdoor setting. However, no one\u2019s stopping you from linking two Angle 3\u2019s\ntogether for higher volume. The main thing this speaker has going for it is\nrange.\n\nYou can stream to the speaker from 100ft away. You can also set up two\nspeakers up to 100ft away from your phone in different directions. This will\ncreate a much [richer sound effect](https://musicoomph.com/best-soundbars/),\nespecially if you\u2019re partying multiple walled-off areas.\n\nAlthough built for the outdoors, this speaker is also built with budget-\nconstrained people in mind. Therefore, the waterproofing is just an IPX6. It\nstill makes the speaker highly resilient against splashing, it\u2019s just not\nideal to keep it at the edge of a pool. But at least you can afford to buy\nanother one at this price.\n\nAnother interesting ability is running playlists for up to 20 hours. That\u2019s a\nlot longer than what most other manufacturers are offering off one charge.\n\nThere are no equalizer modes to browse through. However, the frequencies are\nquite balanced and the sound doesn\u2019t distort even when you push the volume all\nthe way up.\n\nWhat I also personally appreciated is the very stable design. The triangle\nshape ensures that the speaker won\u2019t wobble or be tipped over by wind.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAgABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAACAAEAAAICBAoAOw==)\n\n  * Affordable\n  * Check Circle\n\nAlmost no distortion\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nBalanced frequency response\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nGreat stability\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nLong range\n\n  * Only IPX6 waterproofing\n  * Times Circle\n\nDoesn\u2019t play very loud\n\n* * *\n\n### 8\\.

The Soundcore Bluetooth speaker has been listed on many \u201cbest of\u201d\nlists before and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to start losing popularity\nanytime soon.\n\nThe speaker is loaded with features. The dual drivers are positioned in a\nback-to-back design. This allows a wider sound projection and a better\ndelivery of surround sound effect. The passive bass radiators further enhance\nthe audio by giving it much needed richness and warmth.\n\nPairing is available and even though it can only pair with another speaker,\nthis is always a nice feature in Bluetooth speakers. You can enhance the audio\nquality, boost the volume, and save battery at the same time, etc.\n\nWhat\u2019s also cool is the LED setup. If you\u2019re old enough to miss pulsing and\nstrobe stereos, you\u2019ll satisfy your nostalgia with the Anker Soundcore. The\nspeaker has various light shows to offer depending on the rhythm, and you can\nalso customize the lighting to your liking.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAgABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAACAAEAAAICBAoAOw==)\n\n  * IPX7 waterproofing\n  * Check Circle\n\nEmphasized bass\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nPairing available\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nWide projection\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nLED ambient lighting\n\n  * The lighting drains the battery faster\n\n* * *\n\n### 9\\. [JBL GO 2](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Chorus-Effect-Pedal-\nJBLGO2MGN/dp/B07CZ61M3F?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\n[![](//musicoomph.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/JBL-\nGO-2.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Chorus-Effect-Pedal-\nJBLGO2MGN/dp/B07CZ61M3F?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\n[ View on Amazon ](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Chorus-Effect-Pedal-\nJBLGO2MGN/dp/B07CZ61M3F?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\nWith the JBL GO 2, the name is not an indication that you need two of them to\nenjoy distortion-free music outside. The Go 2 is not a super powerful speaker\nbut it has the bold and clear JBL sound and clean audio projection, which is\npretty much all you can ask for in a budget-friendly Bluetooth speaker.\n\nThe speaker weighs slightly over half a pound. It\u2019s 1.2\u201dx3.4\u201dx2.8\u201d \u201cbig\u201d. You\nwouldn\u2019t know it when you look at it but it\u2019s quite the rugged outdoor\nspeaker. As light and simple as it looks, it has great waterproofing as it can\nbe submerged in up to 3.3ft of water without getting damaged (on a temporary\nbasis \u2013 don\u2019t go diving with it).\n\nThe GO 2 also comes with built-in speakerphone capabilities. There\u2019s [decent\nnoise cancellation](https://musicoomph.com/best-noise-cancelling-headphones/)\nfor when you want to take calls or issue commands to your virtual assistant.\nThe frequencies are well-balanced but there\u2019s nothing very substantial to\nnotice on the low end.\n\nHowever, for a 3W Bluetooth speaker, the GO 2 has plenty to offer, and the 5\nhours of playtime is nothing to scoff at when you want something really small\nand affordable. The smaller the speaker the smaller the battery, so 5 hours or\nso is about as good as you\u2019re going to get.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAgABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAACAAEAAAICBAoAOw==)\n\n  * Compact and light\n  * Check Circle\n\nPairing compatible\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nNeutral sound\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nSpeakerphone\n\n  * Average battery life\n\n* * *\n\n### 10\\. [AOMAIS GO](https://www.amazon.com/AOMAIS-Bluetooth-Speakers-\nWaterproof-Portable/dp/B071H8MJ99?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\n[![](//musicoomph.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AOMAIS-GO-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/AOMAIS-Bluetooth-Speakers-Waterproof-\nPortable/dp/B071H8MJ99?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\n[ View on Amazon ](https://www.amazon.com/AOMAIS-Bluetooth-Speakers-\nWaterproof-Portable/dp/B071H8MJ99?tag=musicoomph-20)\n\nThe AOMAIS GO Bluetooth speaker is another budget-friendly solution for\noutdoor parties, camping trips, BBQ Sundays, beach parties, and other similar\nsocial gatherings that call for some cool playlist auditions.\n\nThe speaker is as rugged as they come and has [superior\nwaterproofing](https://musicoomph.com/best-swimming-headphones/). It\u2019s rated\nIPX7 and can easily handle being submerged for up to 30 minutes. Not that\nthere\u2019s a good reason to do that ever on purpose.\n\nThe sound is rich and has a small but noticeable 3D stereo quality to it. The\nspeaker is not the smallest one in this price range but the extra size\naccommodates some serious hardware that\u2019s responsible for a better overall\nsound projection and audio quality.\n\nUnder the case you\u2019ll find two 15W drivers and two passive bass radiators that\nprovide consistent low-end definition. The harmonic distortion is rated at\nunder 1%.\n\nThere\u2019s also the option of pairing two speakers together for a pair of left\nand right stereo speakers. The range is not amazing but it borders on the\nindustry average.\n\nWhat\u2019s really cool though is the battery life. At 50% volume, you can squeeze\nup to 30 hours of continuous playback. That\u2019s more than twice what some of the\nbiggest names in the audio equipment manufacturing industry offer these days.\n\nI also like this speaker for its fast charging time. It takes three hours to\nget a full charge. Of course, another nice perk is the emergency power supply.\nThis prevents abrupt shutdowns and potential fadeouts.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAgABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAACAAEAAAICBAoAOw==)\n\n  * Rugged design\n  * Check Circle\n\nGreat waterproofing\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nEnhanced bass\n\n  * Check Circle\n\nExtra-long battery life\n\n  * Larger than most similar speakers\n\n* * *\n\n## What Your Use Cases Would Look Like\n\n![](//musicoomph.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Bluetooth-Speaker-Next-to-a-\nSmartphone.jpg)\n\nWhat I mean by that is where you plan on using your Bluetooth speakers.\nBluetooth speakers cover a wide spectrum of uses and come in different designs\nand levels of durability and reliability.\n\nWhen you're looking to buy new speakers, you must first ask yourself why you\nneed them? Do you want a pair of cheap Bluetooth speakers for your gaming\nlaptop or [gaming PC](https://musicoomph.com/best-budget-computer-speakers/)?\n\u2013 If so, you may not need to pay top dollar for high-end waterproofing. You\njust need audio quality.\n\nWhat if you host a lot of BBQ Sundays? Or, what if you\u2019re an avid camper who\nlikes listening to your favorite tunes when you\u2019re roughing it in the woods\nover the weekend? \u2013 Well, there are plenty of affordable Bluetooth speakers\nthat can give you clear and powerful projection in an outdoor setting.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re shopping for outdoor speakers on a budget, you may want to\nsacrifice a bit of sound definition in favor of a more reliable casing.\nWaterproof speakers or even weatherproof speakers should then be your top\npriority even over features and specs. Look for high IPX ratings.\n\nDust-proofing and anti-shock features may also be important. This can be\nequally important whether you use the speakers in the comfort of your home or\non the beach.\n\n## What to Expect in Terms of Audio Quality\n\nWhenever you\u2019re looking for budget-friendly audio equipment, you have to\nmanage your expectations. I\u2019m not saying that Bluetooth speakers under $100\ndon\u2019t sound good. I\u2019m just saying that they won\u2019t sound like a [5.1 Dolby HD\nhome theatre system](https://musicoomph.com/best-small-5-1-receivers/).\n\nHere are some of the tricks that I use to determine whether or not affordable\nBluetooth speakers are worth my time.\n\nFirst of all, you\u2019ll want a speaker that sound much larger than the size.\nImagine a little dog that barks like a big dog.\n\nIn all honesty, I was really taken aback by how good these speakers sounded.\nLike I mentioned, I know of a few hardcore audiophiles with megabucks Wilson\nAudio speakers that were mightily impressed by some of those barrel JBL\nspeakers. They don\u2019t mind using one of them with their laptops or as an\noutdoor speaker at all.\n\nOn the other hand, [dialogue-enhancing features](https://musicoomph.com/best-\ncenter-channel-speakers/) are hard to come by at bargain prices. But look at\nit this way. You only really need that when watching movies or TV shows. If\nyou\u2019re not using your Bluetooth speaker [to binge watch\nNetflix](https://musicoomph.com/best-wireless-tv-speakers/) in the camper,\nthen this is one feature you can be less picky about.\n\nI also place more value on volume than overall sound quality. You can\u2019t avoid\nsome harmonic distortion or clear imbalance when it comes to frequency\ndefinition. But having enough power is very satisfying.\n\nYou can\u2019t really throw a pool party if your Bluetooth speakers can\u2019t cover all\nthe small talk going around in your backyard.\n\n## Battery Life\n\nPeople rarely look for Bluetooth speakers that they have to plug into the\nwall, which defeats the purpose of going wireless. As with any type of\nwireless speakers, these are generally sought for their portability and\nflexibility when it comes to placement and using in various environments.\n\nTherefore, if you\u2019re getting battery-powered speakers you have to make sure\nyou can squeeze as many hours as you can while using them at medium to maximum\nvolume. Don\u2019t settle for anything less than USB charging. Some of them may\neven have a USB output for charging your phone.\n\n## The More the Merrier?\n\n![](//musicoomph.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Several-Bluetooth-\nSpeakers.jpg)\n\nAs you\u2019ll quickly notice, Bluetooth speakers rarely come in pairs. They\u2019re\nusually sold as individual devices. Therefore, both quality and power are\nsomewhat limited in some situations.\n\nSome Bluetooth speakers come with standard single-device pairing. Some can\nallow you to connect even more than two speakers together, thus creating an\namped-up audio system for your outdoor social gatherings, or even a whole\nhouse audio system.\n\nMost of the time, though, this will only work with speakers of the same brand\nand you may have to do it through an app. However, there is certainly some\nvalue to being able to add more speakers to your system.\n\nIf you already have the best bluetooth speaker under $100 which you can\nafford, adding a second one may be a lot easier than upgrading to a higher\nclass. As impressive as today\u2019s 360-degree sound field, adding another speaker\ncan add a lot more depth and spatial cues to the soundstage.\n\n **Bluetooth May Be the New Standard**\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how far Bluetooth technology has come in just [two\ndecades](https://www.bluetooth.com/about-us/our-history/). The audio quality\naside, Bluetooth speakers are all the rage now because of how easy they are to\nuse and how cheap they\u2019ve become.\n\nThis list of portable bluetooth speakers has a bit of something for everyone.\nYou\u2019ve got something for the regular folks, something for the average camper,\nand even something for the demanding audiophile.\n\nYou can use these speakers indoor or outdoor. In fact, Bluetooth speakers were\noriginally designed as indoor computer speakers. Any of my recommended\nspeakers would be a huge upgrade over any laptop speakers. You might find some\nof them to outperform your highly rated desktop speakers as well.\n\n![Gavin Whitner](https://musicoomph.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Gavin-\nWhitner.jpg)\n\n##### Gavin Whitner\n\nA guitar player, songwriter, composer, and also the lead editor of MusicOomph,\nGavin is one of the four musician friends behind this site.
