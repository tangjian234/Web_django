Not only does the Sonos Move, the first portable Sonos\ndevice, pack expected Sonos-quality sound, but its built-in battery makes it\none of the [best smart speakers](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-smart-\nspeakers,review-4480.html) for indoor-outdoor use we've seen. It also has\n[_Google Assistant_](https://www.tomsguide.com/reference/how-to-use-google-\nassistant) and [_Alexa_](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/how-to-use-\nalexa,review-3488.html), making it a useful companion for voice-operated\nsmart-home control.\n\n  * Check out our [Sonos Arc review](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/sonos-arc)\n  * [What is Sonos](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/what-is-sonos,review-5140.html)? A guide to the premium speaker system\n\nThe Sonos Move ($399) sports a new Sonos technology called Auto TruePlay,\nwhich uses microphones to automatically tune the speaker for its surroundings.\nBluetooth control and 11 hours of battery life (thanks to a recent software\nupdate) make it a worthy portable version of the stellar [Sonos\nOne](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/sonos-one,review-4762.html), and one of the\n[best Bluetooth speakers](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-bluetooth-\nspeakers,review-1982.html) with premium audio. But with that, it comes at a\npremium price.\n\n## Sonos Move: Price and availability\n\nThe Sonos Move costs $399.99 is available to purchase as of this writing. It\noriginally launched in a single, Shadow Black finish, but Sonos has since\nadded a Lunar White option with UV protection. In other words, it shouldn't\nyellow in the sun.\n\n## Sonos Move: Design\n\nWhen compared with the Sonos One, the Sonos Move is the cooler cousin. Its\nmatte almost-black finish and grille combination is stylish enough for a\nmodern space without hiding its purpose. It's tall, broad and oval in shape.\nIt's a true progression from the classic Sonos design.\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nI docked the Move on my white marble kitchen island, where it fielded\nattention with grace. My Sonos One, by comparison, is camouflaged with the\nrest of my home entertainment device on my TV stand.\n\nA respectable two-thirds of the Move's exterior holds the speaker grille,\nwhile the back panel features a up-facing claw-grip handle. Also on the back\nis the power button, a button that lets you switch from Wi-Fi to Bluetooth,\nand a button for connecting the Move to other Sonos speakers in your sound\nsystem.\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nThe top has volume, pause and play controls, as well as two status lights: one\nindicating when the speaker is on and another when the Move's four-microphone\nsetup is listening.\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\n> When compared with the Sonos One, the Sonos Move is the cooler cousin.\n\nSize and weight are the Move's glaring design setback. With more than 6 pounds\npacked into its 10-inch tall body, it's a dense device. It's unpleasant to\ncarry the Move while trying to hold anything else. Even the trip up to my\napartment's rooftop with the Move in one hand and a coffee mug in the other\nfelt awkward. Transporting the Move anywhere a few minutes away is a two-\nhanded job.\n\nSo schlepping this thing to the beach might be unrealistic \u2014 check out our\nlist of the [_best Bluetooth speakers_](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-\nbluetooth-speakers,review-1982.html) for more portable options \u2014 but moving\naround different parts of a home or outside to the backyard are more\nplausible.\n\n## Sonos Move: Audio performance\n\nWhen it comes to engineering speakers, Sonos has a stellar track record. The\nMove offers a melodic listening experience with its tweeter, woofer and two\namplifiers. Depending on your preference, the speaker can provide subtle\nbackground noise, booming dance bass and everything in between. Even at its\nloudest, the Sonos Move sounded balanced thumping out Billie Eilish's \"Bad\nGuy.\"\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\n> The speaker can provide subtle background noise, booming dance bass and\n> everything in between.\n\nOn the rooftop of my block-long apartment building, the Move's music filled\nthe elevated open air. At full volume, neighbors on the opposite side of the\npatio came over to inquire about the party. What they found was me, alone,\nplaying Spotify's \"Dance Hits\" radio through an incredibly powerful speaker.\n\nAs for listening options, the Sonos Move offers 100 streaming services\ncontrolled from the Sonos app, using voice, or with Apple AirPlay 2. But only\nwhen the device is connected to your Wi-Fi. Once you switch to Bluetooth, you\ncan play audio direct only from music service apps like Spotify and Pandora.\n\n## Sonos Move: Auto TruePlay\n\nIf you have a Sonos speaker, you may have used TruePlay via your smartphone to\nsynchronize the device for the space it sits in. The Move replaces that manual\nconfiguration with Auto TruePlay, a new technology from Sonos that lets the\nspeaker automatically tune itself through built-in microphones. Sonos says\nit's not as precise as the traditional manual setup with its other speakers,\nbut it's a lot more convenient.\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nNot all outdoor spaces have the same acoustics, so Auto TruePlay is supposed\nto adjust sound settings to best fit your surroundings. Whether you're at a\npacked backyard party, an open-aired beachfront or a tiny balcony, the Sonos\nMove should deliver a balanced audio experience.\n\nI put Auto TruePlay to the test in a few indoor locales and noticed subtle\nchanges. I undocked the Move from my counter and put in an open bedroom shelf,\nwhere it slightly decreased the bass in Zedd's \"Clarity\" to subdue the echo.\nWhen I left the room and shut the door behind me, I hardly heard the\nelectronic anthem at medium volume, which I'm sure my apartment mates\nappreciated.\n\n **MORE:**[ **Sonos One Review**](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/sonos-\none,review-4762.html)\n\nOutside is where Auto TruePlay shines. On my apartment's rooftop patio, the\nMove's audio sounded flawless. It drowned out the sound of traffic and trains\nbelow, but didn't impede on that face-to-face conversation I had with my\nneighbors. I never want to manually calibrate a speaker again after using the\nMove, and I hope Auto TruePlay is in all Sonos speakers going forward.\n\n## Sonos Move: Outdoor use\n\nMost smart speakers need Wi-Fi to work, so they become less than useful once\nyou're outside the range of a network. Sonos solved this quandary by\ninstalling a switch in the Move that lets users choose whether they'd like the\noperate the speaker over a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection. Pressing the button\noverrides the standard Wi-Fi control so that users may pair their smartphone\nto the Move.\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nBut once you're on Bluetooth mode, you're no longer using a smart speaker.\nAside from its Sonos-quality sound, it's the same as any other portable\nspeaker. Alexa and Google Assistant are checked at your home Wi-Fi\u2019s door, and\nthe Sonos app is rendered useless. You can't even pair two different devices\nto it for multiple DJs.\n\nThe Move's movement has limits, and I think it's as far as your Wi-Fi reaches.\nMove it to your backyard, patio or porch \u2013\u2013 pretty much anywhere where you'll\nstill get the comprehensive Sonos library and can make voice commands.\n\n## Sonos Move: Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant\n\nThe Sonos Move packs two popular virtual assistants: Amazon Alexa and Google\nAssistant. Setting up both (you can't use them simultaneously) on the Move is\nsimple, and once you enable your assistant of choice, you can ask the Move for\nthings like your local weather, a newscast and your schedule for the day. You\ncan also operate several of your smart-home devices with voice commands if\nyour Move is in range.\n\nOn my home Wi-Fi network, the Move responded to a number of the [best Google\nAssistant skills](https://www.tomsguide.com/round-up/best-google-assistant-\ncommands) requests without hesitation. I switched playlists, found out current\ntraffic conditions before I left for dinner, and turned off my living room's\nsmart light bulbs using my voice.\n\n **MORE:**[ _ **15 Google Home Smart Speakers, Ranked from Best to\nWorst**_](https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-google-home-speakers)\n\nHowever, there are some limitations when compared to smart speakers made by\nAmazon. For instance, like the Sonos One, the Move doesn't support calling or\nthe Alexa Drop-In intercom feature. Still, it's able to use most of the [best\nAlexa skills](https://www.tomsguide.com/round-up/best-alexa-skills).\n\n## Sonos Move: Charging and battery life\n\nThe Move's battery life lives up to Sonos promise of 10 hours on a full\ncharge. For this review, I played a variety of genres at different noise\nlevels nonstop from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. as I went about my day. The battery\nsteadily drained by 10% every hour or so.\n\nThe Move also switches to suspend mode when it's not being used, allowing it\nto preserve battery life for up to 120 hours, according to Sonos.\n\nWhen it ran out of juice, I recharged the Move by setting in on the included\nring power base. Though it can be charged on-the-go with a compatible USB-C\ntravel charger, too. However, unlike some other portable Bluetooth speakers,\nyou can't use the Move's battery to charge other devices.\n\n## Sonos Move: Durability and drop test\n\nWith any [_portable speaker_](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-bluetooth-\nspeakers,review-1982.html), durability is a must. The great outdoors isn't\nalways tech-friendly, so you'll want to know if your device can withstand\nweather and roughhousing before you bring it out of the house. With an IP56\nrating, the Move is dustproof and waterproof enough to withstand coarse sand\nor a rainy night when forgotten outside.\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\n> I never want to manually calibrate a speaker again after using the Move, and\n> I hope Auto TruePlay is in all Sonos speakers going forward.\n\nI didn't want to rough up the Sonos Move too much, but I put it against the\nelements I face on a regular basis: liquids and slippery fingers. A splash\nfrom a water bottle proved harmless to the Move. I wouldn't leave it too close\nto the pool's edge, but it'll fare fine doused with typical outdoor party\nbeverages and condiments.\n\nWith weight being a concern of mine, I wanted to know that the Sonos Move\nwouldn't expire with an accidental drop. I let it fall from my hand 3 feet in\nthe air. The sigh of relief I exuded was almost louder than the Move, which,\nmuch to my delight, still worked after the concrete collision. It earned some\nminor exterior battle wounds upon closer inspection, but they weren't obvious.\n\nIf outdoor performance is a concern, then you can also check out our list of\n[best outdoor speakers](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-outdoor-\nspeakers,review-2785.html).\n\n## Sonos Move: Value\n\nIf you're shopping for smart speakers with an open mind, you might not want to\ninvest $399 before knowing how it could integrate into your smart home.\nAlthough we haven't tested it yet, the Bose Portable Home Speaker also has\nAlexa and Google Assistant, but costs $50 less and is about a third of the\nweight.\n\nAnd the stationary Sonos One will set you back just $179. In other words, you\ncould get two Sonos One speakers (a popular surround-sound entertainment\nsetup) for the price of the Sonos Move.\n\n **MORE:**[ _ **Best Smart Speakers**_](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-\nsmart-speakers,review-4480.html)\n\nBut the Sonos One can't accompany you outdoors. If you spend a good chunk of\nyour time home in your backyard, you might want to opt for a speaker you can\ncarry around.\n\n## Sonos Move: Verdict\n\nThe Sonos Move is a solid smart speaker, but I would call it a wireless smart\nspeaker before calling it a portable one. Being able to transport it around\nthe home and immediate outdoor spaces is useful, but its weight and lack of\nsmarts on Bluetooth mode would discourage me from packing it for a day trip.\n\nStill, there is a best portable smart speaker title to be earned, and the\nSonos Move makes a convincing argument with its exceptional audio quality and\nAuto TruePlay tuning. It's up against the bucket-handled [_Bose Portable Home\nSpeaker_](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/bose-portable-home-speaker-specs-\nprice) ($349), which also has built-in support for Alexa and Google Assistant.\nThe stationary Sonos One is still a better option as an in-house smart\nspeaker, but the Move adds a long-demanded dynamic alternative to the Sonos\nlineup.\n\n__ See all comments (0)\n\nNo comments yet [ Comment from the forums\n](https://forums.tomsguide.com/threads/sonos-move-speaker-hands-on-\nreview.457406/)\n\n__Be In the Know\n\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and\nhelpful tips.\n\nThank you for signing up to Tom's Guide.
