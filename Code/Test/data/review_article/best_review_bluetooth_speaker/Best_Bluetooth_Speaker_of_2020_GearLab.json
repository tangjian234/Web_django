To test these speakers we listened to each side-by-side for more than\na hundred hours, took them to the beach, brought them to campfires, travelled\nwith them everywhere, and pushed their batteries to the limit. We also\nconsulted with a professional audio engineer to ensure our sound quality tests\nwere up to snuff. The resulting top picks from all of this testing cover the\nentire range of portable speakers, from larger models that place an emphasis\non sound quality, to smaller waterproof devices that can take a beating, and\neverything in between.\n\n  \n\n## Top 20 Product Ratings\n\nDisplaying 1 - 5 of 20\n\n\u226a Previous | [Compare](/topics/audio/best-bluetooth-speaker/ratings) | [Next\n\u226b](/topics/audio/best-bluetooth-speaker?specs=n&n=5&sort_field=#compare)\n\n## Best Overall Bluetooth Speaker\n\n  \n\n### Bose SoundLink Revolve\n\n  \n\n[![](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](/reviews/audio/bluetooth-\nspeaker/bose-soundlink-revolve)\n\n![Editors' Choice Award](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/review_images/award_logo_ec_48x133.png)\n\n  * 1\n  * 2\n  * 3\n  * 4\n  * 5\n\n  \n\n$199.00\n\nat Amazon\n\n[See\nIt](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCQKTKR?tag=tglcom20-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1)\n\n  \n\n86\n\n **OVERALL  \nSCORE**\n\n  * Sound Quality **10**\n\n  * Portability **7**\n\n  * Volume **8**\n\n  * Battery Life **8**\n\n**Weight** : 24 oz | **Battery Life** : 18 hrs  \n\nExcellent sound quality\n\nWater-resistant\n\nGreat battery life\n\nExpensive\n\nRelatively heavy\n\nFor those that demand great sound quality no matter the situation, **Bose** 's\nflagship portable speakers are the clear choice. Both the **Soundlink\nRevolve** and its bigger sibling, the **Revolve+** , produce exceptionally\ndeep bass and impressive clarity, creating a rich overall sound that you'll be\nshocked is coming from a battery-powered speaker. That sound is backed up with\nIPX4 certified waterproofing, meaning both speakers can shake off rain or\npoolside splashes, and batteries that can supply multiple afternoons worth of\nmusic listening. The only difference between these models is that the\n**Revolve+** adds a bit of size and weight in return for a louder maximum\nvolume and more battery life.\n\nThe only strikes against these speakers are their price and weight. Listing\nfor significantly more than most other models, these speakers certainly aren't\ncheap. At 24 ounces the **Revolve** is certainly noticeable when you put it in\na backpack, and the 34 ounce **Revolve+** would be a bit cumbersome to lug to\nthe beach. These downsides, however, feel well worth the great sound quality\nthat they provide. We would recommend the **Revolve** to anyone looking for a\nportable, high-end listening experience, and the **Revolve+** to anyone\ndesiring a speaker with enough volume to power a pool party or barbeque.\n\n**Read review:** [Bose Soundlink Revolve](/reviews/audio/bluetooth-\nspeaker/bose-soundlink-revolve \"Bose SoundLink Revolve Review\")  \n\n**Read review:** [Bose Soundlink Revolve+](/reviews/audio/bluetooth-\nspeaker/bose-soundlink-revolve-plus \"Bose Soundlink Revolve+ Review\")\n\n## Best Bang for Your Buck\n\n  \n\n### Bose SoundLink Color II\n\n  \n\n[![](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](/reviews/audio/bluetooth-\nspeaker/bose-soundlink-color-ii)\n\n![Best Buy Award](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/review_images/award_logo_bb_48x133.png)\n\n  * 1\n  * 2\n  * 3\n  * 4\n  * 5\n\n  \n\n$129.00\n\nat Amazon\n\n[See\nIt](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HETFQKS?tag=tglcom20-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1)\n\n  \n\n73\n\n **OVERALL  \nSCORE**\n\n  * Sound Quality **8**\n\n  * Portability **7**\n\n  * Volume **8**\n\n  * Battery Life **5**\n\n**Weight** : 19.8 oz | **Battery Life** : 13 hrs  \n\nGreat sound quality\n\nWater-resistant\n\nGood battery life\n\nRubber coating sometimes hangs onto dust\n\nStriking an impressive balance between price, sound quality, and durability,\nthe **Bose Soundlink Color II** checks more boxes than most speakers on the\nmarket today. While its bass isn't quite as booming as the company's top\nmodels, it still manages to produce a rotund low-end that is balanced by great\nclarity and brightness through the mid and treble ranges. This results in a\nvery well-rounded sound that works great for pretty much any type of music. At\naround 20 ounces and sporting IPX4 water-resistant, it is relatively portable\nas well. Finally, it certainly isn't a budget option, but the price is well\nbelow that of the premium speakers. Yet it still provides near-premium\nperformance, which makes this speaker a great value-per-dollar.\n\nAll in all there isn't too much to complain about when it comes to the **Bose\nSoundlink Color II**. In a perfect world it would be a bit lighter, and we\nwould prefer it to be totally waterproof rather than just water-resistant.\nAdditionally its rubber coating, which makes it very resistant to scratches,\nsometimes attracts lint and dust. However, considering the exceptional price\nto performance ratio offered by this speaker, these are very minor issues. We\nwould wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.\n\n**Read review:** [Bose SoundLink Color II](/reviews/audio/bluetooth-\nspeaker/bose-soundlink-color-ii \"Bose SoundLink Color II Review\")\n\n## Best Buy on a Shoestring Budget\n\n  \n\n### Tribit XSound Go\n\n  \n\n[![](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](/reviews/audio/bluetooth-\nspeaker/tribit-xsound-go)\n\n![Best Buy Award](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/review_images/award_logo_bb_48x133.png)\n\n  * 1\n  * 2\n  * 3\n  * 4\n  * 5\n\n  \n\n$32.99\n\n(34% off)  \nat Amazon\n\n[See\nIt](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07594HZ6Y?tag=tglcom20-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1)\n\n  \n\n54\n\n **OVERALL  \nSCORE**\n\n  * Sound Quality **4**\n\n  * Portability **8**\n\n  * Volume **3**\n\n  * Battery Life **8**\n\n**Weight** : 13.4 oz | **Battery Life** : 18.5 hrs  \n\nInexpensive\n\nCompletely waterproof\n\nWeak bass\n\nNot very loud\n\nSometimes you just want an inexpensive, totally waterproof speaker that you\ncan take out on the lake without worry. If you find yourself in this\nsituation, we think the **Tribit XSound Go** is your best bet. Sporting fully\nsubmersible IPX7 waterproofing, a price tag that won't induce tears if it\nfalls off the boat, and a weight of less than a pound, this speaker is the\nperfect companion for rough and tumble watersports.\n\nLike all small and relatively inexpensive speakers, the **XSound Go** cuts\nsome corners when it comes to sound quality. Bass power is a bit lacking, and\nthe overall sound can come through as a bit thin and tinny, especially when\nthe volume is maxed out. But, if you just want a speaker that can belt out a\ndecent tune and withstand a dunking, the **XSound Go** can check those boxes\nwithout costing too much.\n\n**Read review:** [Tribit XSound Go](/reviews/audio/bluetooth-speaker/tribit-\nxsound-go \"Tribit XSound Go Review\")\n\n## Best for Travel\n\n  \n\n### Bose SoundLink Micro\n\n  \n\n[![](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](/reviews/audio/bluetooth-\nspeaker/bose-soundlink-micro)\n\n![Top Pick Award](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/review_images/award_logo_tp_48x133.png)\n\n  * 1\n  * 2\n  * 3\n  * 4\n  * 5\n\n  \n\n$79.00\n\n(28% off)  \nat Amazon\n\n[See\nIt](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748N1BZD?tag=tglcom20-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1)\n\n  \n\n68\n\n **OVERALL  \nSCORE**\n\n  * Sound Quality **7**\n\n  * Portability **10**\n\n  * Volume **6**\n\n  * Battery Life **2**\n\n**Weight** : 10.2 oz | **Battery Life** : 5 hrs  \n\nGood sound quality\n\nCompletely waterproof\n\nLightweight and portable\n\nShort battery life\n\nFor situations where size and weight are at a premium, it's hard to beat the\n**Bose SoundLink Micro**. Tipping the scales at well under a pound and\nsporting a profile so slim you might be able to fit it in your pocket, this\nspeaker almost disappears when you toss it into a bag. It also pumps out\nimpressive sound that completely belies its small size, with fairly thumpy\nbass and solid clarity that never gives way to the tinniness heard from many\nother small speakers.\n\nThe only complaint we have about this speaker is its relatively short battery\nlife. It lasted just 5 hours in our testing, which makes it a poor choice for\nextended camping trips or the like. However, if you're going on a vacation\nwhere you'll regularly be able to find an outlet, this speaker will take up\nalmost no space in your carry-on and it can definitely make your hotel room\nsound better.\n\n**Read review:** [Bose SoundLink Micro](/reviews/audio/bluetooth-speaker/bose-\nsoundlink-micro \"Bose SoundLink Micro Review\")\n\n## A Worthy, Waterproof, Bose Alternative\n\n  \n\n### JBL Flip 5\n\n  \n\n[![](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](/reviews/audio/bluetooth-\nspeaker/jbl-flip-5)\n\n  * 1\n  * 2\n  * 3\n  * 4\n  * 5\n\n  \n  \n\n$119.95\n\nat Amazon\n\n[See\nIt](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QK2SPP7?tag=tglcom20-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1)\n\n  \n\n77\n\n **OVERALL  \nSCORE**\n\n  * Sound Quality **7**\n\n  * Portability **7**\n\n  * Volume **9**\n\n  * Battery Life **9**\n\n**Weight** : 19 oz | **Battery Life** : 27 hrs  \n\nGood Sound quality\n\nWaterproof\n\nLong battery life\n\nLacks premium sound\n\nIf you're looking at one of the **Bose** models we lauded above thinking,\n\"this would be _perfect_ if only it were waterproof,\" the **JBL Flip 5** is\nlikely your best alternative. Although it is a clear step down in sound\nquality when compared to the **Bose** models, it still sounds quite good. It's\nalso a similar size, produces a lot of volume, and, is completely IPX7\nwaterproof. Plus, it costs a bit less than the competing offerings from\n**Bose**. While we haven't yet found the perfect option for true audiophiles\nthat need a speaker capable of surviving a surprise boat capsizing, the **Flip\n5** is one of the best options currently available on the market.\n\n**Read review:** [JBL Flip 5](/reviews/audio/bluetooth-speaker/jbl-flip-5 \"JBL\nFlip 5 Review\")\n\n## Great for the Home and Backyard Parties\n\n  \n\n### Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 4\n\n  \n\n[![](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](/reviews/audio/bluetooth-\nspeaker/harman-kardon-onyx-studio-4)\n\n  * 1\n  * 2\n  * 3\n  * 4\n  * 5\n\n  \n  \n\n$450\n\nList Price\n\n[See It](/reviews/audio/bluetooth-speaker/harman-kardon-onyx-studio-4)\n\n  \n\n63\n\n **OVERALL  \nSCORE**\n\n  * Sound Quality **8**\n\n  * Portability **2**\n\n  * Volume **9**\n\n  * Battery Life **5**\n\n**Weight** : 72 oz | **Battery Life** : 10.5 hrs  \n\nGreat sound quality\n\nImpressive volume\n\nVery large and heavy\n\nAlthough the 4.5 pound, basketball-sized **Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 4** isn't\nespecially portable, it does fill a useful niche. The large size lets it\nretain good sound quality even when cranked to full volume, making it great\nfor a big backyard barbeque or pool party (something most of the smaller\nspeakers just don't have enough juice to handle). It's also quite easy to\ncarry the **Onyx** around the house, making it a very cheap alternative to\ninvesting in a multi-room, multi-speaker home music system.\n\nAside from its lack of portability, the only real knock against the **Onyx**\nis the fact that the **Bose Soundlink Revolve+** fills a similar niche with a\nbit more aplomb. The **Bose** both sounds a little better and is slightly\nlouder than the **Onyx** , despite being roughly half the size. The **Bose** ,\nhowever, generally sells for double what the **Onyx** goes for.\n\n**Read review:** [Harman Kardon Onyx Studio\n4](https://www.techgearlab.com/reviews/audio/bluetooth-speaker/harman-kardon-\nonyx-studio-4)\n\n  \n\n[![A small sampling of the many speakers we tested.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/15/3/271799_21577_XXL.jpg)\n\nA small sampling of the many speakers we tested.\n\n  \n\n## Why You Should Trust Us\n\n  \n\nTo ensure that we used the best sound quality testing procedure possible we\nconsulted with sound recordist [Palmer\nTaylor](https://www.blackdoveaudio.com). Palmer has recorded audio for such\nhigh-profile clients as National Geographic, ESPN, and Google. His specialty\nlies in location audio, but he has completed several music recording and\ncomposition projects as well. Both lifelong musicians, authors [Steven\nTata](https://www.techgearlab.com/author/steven-tata) and [Max\nMutter](https://www.techgearlab.com/author/max-mutter) have been testing\nconsumer audio products for more than 4 years. They have now used well over\n100 of the most highly regarded home and personal audio gadgets on the market,\nso they have a strong finger on the pulse of what makes a speaker great.\n\nAs we do for all of our audio products, we spent weeks listening to each one\nof our Bluetooth speakers, side-by-side, shifting between widely varying\ngenres of music and podcasts. After carefully assessing each speaker's\nrelative clarity, bass quality, and overall fullness, we then put them through\na battery torture test, blaring a playlist on a loop with the volume cranked\nup to 75% until they finally gave out. With that out of the way, we then took\nall of our speakers on bike rides to the beach, to backyard barbeques, and\nother leisure vacations to assess how well they worked out in the wild. In the\nend, we completed over 200 hours of testing and identified the best portable\nspeaker for almost any situation.\n\n**Related:** [How We Tested Bluetooth Speakers](/topics/audio/best-bluetooth-\nspeaker/how-we-test \"How We Tested Bluetooth Speakers\")\n\n[![](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/15/11/272628_22753_XL.jpg)\n\n[![](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/14/86/270166_27278_XL.jpg)\n\n[![](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/14/87/270204_3215_XL.jpg)\n\n  \n\n## Analysis and Test Results\n\n  \n\nThe best Bluetooth speakers manage to be small and light enough to be carried\naround in a backpack while still being loud enough with quality sound to\nentertain a group of friends at the beach or in the park. They also need to\nhave enough battery life so the party won't be cut short. Accordingly, we\ndivided our testing metrics into 4 categories that fit these ideals: sound\nquality, volume, portability, and battery life. We spent hours comparing all\nof these attributes side-by-side to find the best speaker for every\napplication.\n\n**Related:** [Buying Advice for Bluetooth Speakers](/topics/audio/best-\nbluetooth-speaker/buying-advice \"Buying Advice for Bluetooth Speakers\")\n\n[![Listening to our speakers  like the UE Boom 2 pictured here  in real world\nsettings was the cornerstone of our sound quality\ntesting.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/14/87/270189_19130_XXL.jpg)\n\nListening to our speakers, like the UE Boom 2 pictured here, in real world\nsettings was the cornerstone of our sound quality testing.\n\n  \n\n### Value\n\n  \n\nBluetooth speakers vary pretty widely in price, and their overall value\ndepends largely upon what you're looking for. For instance, if you place a\npremium on sound quality, we think the **Bose Soundlink Revolve** is well\nworth its high price tag. But if you just want something cheap and portable,\nthe **Sony XB10** is a steal. If price and waterproof-ness are your primary\nconcerns, the **Tribit XSound Go** is a great choice. Finally, if you want\nsomething that is a reasonable balance between price, sound quality,\ndurability, and portability, we think the **Bose Soundlink Color II** hits the\nsweet spot.\n\n### Sound Quality\n\n  \n\nAlthough no portable Bluetooth speaker is going to be able to match the sound\nquality of a home speaker system, it needs to provide a big step up from the\nbuilt-in speakers on your smartphone to be of any real use. To assess sound\nquality we had a percussionist who is all about that bass and a guitarist that\nknows the intricacies of treble listen to each speaker play the same songs one\nafter another. After listening to everything from the deep resonance of the\n_Interstellar_ soundtrack to the high, staccato picking of classical guitar,\nwe scored each speaker on bass, treble, clarity, and dynamic range.\n\n  \n\nBoth the **Bose SoundLink Revolve** and the **Soundlink Revole+** shared the\ntop step on the podium in our sound quality testing, earning a perfect score\nof 10 out of 10. In our testing these speakers produced booming bass and were\nthe only models that could hit high notes without even a trace of clipping.\nThey also had impressive clarity and were able to clearly define each note\nwithin even fast saxophone trills. A [close runner-up was the Bose SoundLink\nMini II](/reviews/audio/bluetooth-speaker/bose-soundlink-mini-ii \"Bose\nSoundLink Mini II Review\"). It also produces exceptional sound with no\nclipping. However, its bass isn't quite as powerful as the **Revolve** models,\nwhich gives its sound a bit less depth and well-roundedness.\n\n[![The Bose SoundLink Revolve is the best sounding speaker we\ntested.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/14/92/270723_2348_XXL.jpg)\n\nThe Bose SoundLink Revolve is the best sounding speaker we tested.\n\n  \n\n[Another close runner-up was the Beats Pill+](/reviews/audio/bluetooth-\nspeaker/beats-pill-plus \"Beats Pill+ Review\"). It matched the **Bose Soundlink\nMini II** with incredible clarity, but it fell just a bit short in terms of\nbass and treble. The bass still felt good and thumpy but lacked a little body\nwhen compared to the **Bose** , and the treble showed some slight signs of\nclipping when playing the highest notes.\n\n  \n  \n\nThe **Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 4** , the **Bose SoundLink Color II** , the\n**Sony SRS-XB32** , and the **Beats Pill+** all picked up an 8 out of 10 in\nthis metric. These models are just a small step down in treble quality and\nclarity from the top performers, with some more complex melodies sounding just\na little less crisp. The **Onyx Studio 4** has the deepest bass of any model\nwe tested, but staccato notes weren't as sharp as they were relative to the\ntop scorers. The **SoundLink Color** 's bass is less muddled, but not quite as\ndeep. The bass of the **Beats Pill+** still feels good and thumpy, but lacks a\nlittle body when compared to the **Bose** , and the treble shows some slight\nsigns of clipping when playing the highest notes. The **Sony SRS-XB32** offers\na well-balanced sound across the board, but doesn't have any particular strong\nsuit that would allow it to flatter a specific genera of music.\n\n**Do I Need to Worry About EMFs?**  \nRadiation from electromagnetic fields (EMF) has been in the news as of late.\nWhile exposure to significant sources of EMFs, like living directly under high\nvoltage power lines for an extended period of time, has been proven to pose\nhealth risks, research into the effects of the much lower intensity fields\nemitted by personal electronics has been less than conclusive. Even if you'd\nlike to employ the precautionary principle and avoid as much EMF as possible,\nwe don't think you need to worry about Bluetooth speakers. According to our\nmeasurements, unless you keep the speaker within 6 inches of your head. these\ndevices won't expose you to any more than the general background level of EMF\n(in which case you should probably be shopping for a pair of headphones\ninstead).\n\n  \n\nA whole slew of models earned a score of 7 out of 10 in our sound quality\ntesting. Although most of these possess slightly different attributes, we like\nto refer to them generally as \"good enough\". By that we mean they don't sound\ntinny or underpowered \u2014 the most common problem with a portable speaker. Yet,\nthey also don't offer a particularly premium experience either. For the\nmajority of people that don't want to spend extra to get just a bit more\nclarity or bass power out of their portable listening device, but don't want\nto make too many sacrifices either, this is likely an ideal level of sound\nquality.\n\nFirst off in this group are the **UE Boom 2** and the **UE Boom 3**. We found\nboth iterations of this speaker to sound very similar, with surprising clarity\ngiven the price range, but maybe just a slight lack of bass power when\ncompared to similar models.\n\nAlso earning a 7 out of 10, the impressively small **Bose SoundLink Micro**\npumps out surprisingly loud bass. However, its small stature takes a little\nbite out of the higher registers.\n\n[![The larger Bose Soundlink Revolve+ sounds great and can get very\nloud.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/15/36/275089_2361_XXL.jpg)\n\nThe larger Bose Soundlink Revolve+ sounds great and can get very loud.\n\n  \n\nAnother pair of siblings, both the **JBL Flip 4** and the newer **Flip 5**\nalso fell into this group. Both trend towards a bass-heavy profile, though the\n**Flip 5** does have some more clarity, resulting in a slightly better overall\nsound.\n\nRounding out the 7 out of 10 group, the **JBL Charge 4** offers great clarity\nin the higher registers, but its low end can occasionally get a bit muddled.\nStill, it provides a good overall listening experience that mostly belies its\nportable pedigree.\n\n[![Waterproof models like the UE Roll 2 were able to crank out sound even when\nfully submerged.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/14/86/270174_7281_XXL.jpg)\n\nWaterproof models like the UE Roll 2 were able to crank out sound even when\nfully submerged.\n\n  \n\nTwo impressively portable models earned the correspondingly impressive score\nof 6 out of 10 in the sound quality metric. The **UE Wonderboom** is a clear\nstep down in sound quality from many of the larger models, but it is still\nimpressively full with decent bass given its stature. The **Sony XB10** offers\nsome of the best bass we've heard from a smaller speaker, but its high end\ntends to sound a bit tinny.\n\nLeading off the bottom tier of our sound quality score sheet is the **JBL\nCharge 3** , which earned a score of 5 out of 10. In their marketing, JBL\ncalls this speaker the \"bass radiator\" and it clearly prioritizes bass over\nall else. Although the bass does sound great, it is largely to the detriment\nof overall clarity, with the overarching sound having a muddled quality.\nDynamic range also feels a bit depressed, with some accents and ghost notes\nnot producing their desired effect. However, if you just want something that\ncan throw down a powerful, artificial triplet backbeat, the **Charge 3** is a\ngood choice.\n\nWith a score of 4 out of 10, the **Tribit XSound Go** certainly isn't the most\nmelodious model we tested. The bass is quite weak and the clarity is mediocre,\ncreating an overall sound that we would classify as acceptable, but not good.\nStill, it is a vast improvement compared to listening to music via the built-\nin speakers on your phone.\n\n[![The Bose SoundLink Mini II's sound quality is incredible for such a small\nspeaker.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/14/87/270181_2862_XXL.jpg)\n\nThe Bose SoundLink Mini II's sound quality is incredible for such a small\nspeaker.\n\n  \n\nAt the bottom of our sound quality score sheet were the **Anker SoundCore 2**\nand **Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle** , which each scored 3 out of 10. All\nof these models produced fairly weak bass and relatively poor clarity. The\n**Anker SoundCore 2** had a bit less clipping and a bit more dynamic range\nthan the **Oontz** , but still lagged behind the rest of the field in both of\nthose metrics. All of these speakers still represent a significant upgrade in\nvolume and a decent upgrade in quality when compared to a smartphone's built-\nin speakers, and should still be seen as decent budget options.\n\n[![We carried our speakers everywhere to assess their portability  including\neven models like the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 4 that felt a bit too big to be\ncarried.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/14/87/270192_5009_XXL.jpg)\n\nWe carried our speakers everywhere to assess their portability, including even\nmodels like the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 4 that felt a bit too big to be\ncarried.\n\n  \n\n### Portability\n\n  \n\nIf a Bluetooth speaker is small and light enough to shove in your bag you're\nmore likely to have it with you when your entourage demands some sweet beats.\nOur portability testing was based on three simple questions: is it too heavy,\ndo I have to worry about getting it wet, and can it easily fit in my backpack?\nThe first two questions were easy enough to answer with a scale, and by\nchecking which models have waterproof ratings, with a swim just to verify. To\nassess packability our testers took the speakers everywhere, stuffing them\ninto backpacks, tote bags, and carry-on luggage, to see how easily they fit in\nwith the essentials we were carrying around anyway.\n\n  \n\nWhen it comes to portability, it's hard to beat the **Bose SoundLink Micro**.\nIt is completely IPX7 waterproof, meaning it can survive a complete dunking to\na depth of a meter for up to 30 minutes. It also weighs just 10.2 ounces and\nis so slim it can almost fit into a front pocket.\n\n[![With its light weight  packable shape  and complete waterproofness  the UE\nRoll 2 was the most portable model we tested.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/14/87/270203_15034_XXL.jpg)\n\nWith its light weight, packable shape, and complete waterproofness, the UE\nRoll 2 was the most portable model we tested.\n\n  \n\nThe **Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle** was a close runner-up, earning a\nscore of 9 in this metric. It is the lightest model we tested at 9.4 ounces.\nEven though it is quite tiny, its triangular shape just doesn't slip into a\npack as easily as some other models do. It also has an IPX5 rating, meaning it\ncan withstand being hit by a pressurized stream of water, which is useful if\nyou tend to get into a lot of super soaker fights. Both of these top-scoring\nmodels are light enough that they might find their way into your pack for\nextended hikes or even backpacking trips, assuming you're not too much of a\nminimalist. The **Sony XB10** also earned a score of 9 in this metric. Its\ntiny size and low weight of only 8.8 ounces make it disappear in a backpack.\nHowever, it is only water-resistant rather than fully waterproof.\n\nThe **UE Wonderboom** and both the **Boom 2** and the **Boom 3** earned 8 out\nof 10 when our portability testing was said and done. The **Wonerboom** is\nslightly more portable than the other two, weighing in at 15 ounces and\nboasting IPX7 waterproofness. Its short and stout shape also helps it\ndisappear inside of a backpack. The **Boom** models are considerably taller,\nbut the cylindrical shape still keeps them fairly low-profile when it comes to\npacking. They are a bit heavier at 22 ounces, and he **Boom** boasts an IP67\nrating, which means it is both waterproof _and_ dustproof.\n\n[![The Tribit XSound Go is fairly light at 13.4 ounces and completely\nwaterproof.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/15/33/274857_22847_XXL.jpg)\n\nThe Tribit XSound Go is fairly light at 13.4 ounces and completely waterproof.\n\n  \n\nAlso picking up an 8 out of 10 in our portability metric is the **Tribit\nXSound Go**. It weighs a relatively feathery 13.4 ounces and boasts total IPX7\nwaterproofness, meaning it can survive a dunking in a meter of water. We also\nfound its rounded edges to make it a bit more amenable to being stuffed into a\nbag already full of soggy beach towels than many other speakers.\n\nA slew of different models earned a score of 7 out of 10 in our portability\ntesting. For the most part these models were waterproof (or at least water-\nresistant), and weigh more than 1 pound but less than 2 pounds. One such model\nis the **UE Boom 2** , which weighs in at 19.5 ounces and is completely IPX7\nrated waterproof. The cylindrical shape also makes it fairly easy to stuff\ninto a bag.\n\nThe **Bose SoundLink Color II** also weighs 19.5 ounces, putting it in the not\ntoo heavy but certainly not light category. The IPX4 water-resistant rating\nmeans it can repel most of the wetness associated with a day at the beach or\non the lake, though it probably won't survive complete submersion. The rubber\ncoating resists scratches and dings, and the flat shape is relatively\npackable.\n\n[![The SoudLink Color is water resistant and rubber\ncoated.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/15/3/271798_24612_XXL.jpg)\n\nThe SoudLink Color is water resistant and rubber coated.\n\n  \n\nThe Editors' Choice winning **Bose SoundLink Revolve** is nearly as portable\nas its rubber-coated sibling. At 24 ounces it is a bit heavier, but it still\ndoesn't feel too hefty when carried in a backpack. It is also IPX4 water-\nresistant, and the brushed metal exterior and cylindrical shape generally\nallow it to slide into overstuffed bags with ease.\n\nAt just 13 ounces you barely notice you're carrying the **Anker SoundCore 2**\n, and its IPX4 water resistance lets you take it out even when the clouds are\nthreatening. However, it lost some points because of the sharp edges, which\nmake it a bit untenable when trying to shove it into an overstuffed bag.\n\nRounding out the above-average models in this metric, both the **JBL Flip 4**\nand **Flip 5** are 19 ounces and IPX7 waterproof. Both models would have\nscored higher in this metric if it weren't for the sharp edges on the top and\nbottom of the speakers. We noticed these edges snagging on things whenever we\ntried to shove it into a bag. The newer **Flip 5** is just a _tad_ larger, but\nnot so much as to be noticeable when shoving it into a bag.\n\n  \n\nMost of the rest of the models we tested were hampered in this metric due to a\nlack of any sort of water-resistant rating, which inevitably made us more\nreluctant to take them outside under anything other than bluebird skies. The\nmost portable of these hydrophobic models is the **Anker SoundCore 2** , which\nearned a score of 6 out of 10. The **Soundcore 2** 's rubberized exterior also\nlends more confidence that it can withstand minor drops and resist scratches.\n\n[![We made sure all of our water resistant/proof models were in fact water\nresistant/proof.

Pictured here are the JBL Charge 3 (front) and the (back,\nleft to right) Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz, UE Roll 2, UE Boom 2, and Bose\nSoundLink Color II.\n\n  \n\nThe **Bose Soundlink Revolve+** sports IPX4 water resistance, making it\ngenerally safe as a poolside companion. However, it clearly prioritizes volume\nover portability. Its 2 pound 2 ounce frame makes it quite loud, but not\nparticularly packable.\n\nThe **Bose SoundLink Mini II** earned an average 5 out of 10 in our\nportability testing largely due to its heft at 24 ounces. It also sports a\nhard metal exterior without any sort of rubber coating, meaning it's more\nsusceptible to scratches and possibly even dents. Finally, it lacks any sort\nof water resistance rating, and its sharp corners make it hard to slide into a\nloaded bag.\n\nThe **Beats Pill+** also earned a 5 out of 10 in this metric. Tipping the\nscales at 27 ounces, this speaker is very noticeable when carried in a\nbackpack. It also lacks any sort of protective rubber on its exterior, and is\nnot water-resistant to any degree. The pill shape, however, does make it a bit\neasier to shove into a loaded backpack.\n\n[![The UE Boom 2 was the best sounding of the fully waterproof models we\ntested.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/14/87/270175_28341_XXL.jpg)\n\nThe UE Boom 2 was the best sounding of the fully waterproof models we tested.\n\n  \n\nThe **JBL Charge 3** and the newer **JBL Charge 4** are both outliers in that\nthey are IPX7 waterproof, but are so large that they only scored 5 out of 10\nin our portability testing. The **Charge 3** is 28 ounces, and the **Charge\n4** is even heftier at 32 ounces. Both are too heavy to be reasonably carried\nlong distances, but the waterproofing means both can handle campsites where\nbeverage spilling might be a problem.\n\nThe **Sony SRS-XB32** also tips the scales at a robust 32 ounces. Even IP67\ndust and waterproof ratings couldn't save it from a mediocre score in our\nportability testing. It earned a 5 out of 10.\n\nThe **Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 4** , which earned a low score of 2 out of 10\nin this metric, is portable only by the most technical definition of the word.\nAt a full 72 ounces (that's 4.5 pounds) it is as heavy as a large laptop. Its\n11-inch flying saucer shape also can't fit easily into a backpack or bag. This\npuppy might make it out to the backyard for a barbecue, or possibly on a car\ncamping trip, but that's about it.\n\n[![The Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 4 is hardly portable and dominated our volume\ntesting.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/14/87/270190_17730_XXL.jpg)\n\nThe Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 4 is hardly portable and dominated our volume\ntesting.\n\n  \n\n### Volume\n\n  \n\nProducing enough sound for a couple of people lounging on the beach and enough\nsound for a barbecue with 20+ people are very different tasks. Some speakers\njust won't be able to cut it in the latter situation. We evaluated volume\nobjectively with a sound meter. We found that most of the speakers were able\nto produce similar maximum decibel levels, but some sounded incredibly shrill\nat high volumes while others were able to retain their musicality. So we ended\nup rating them subjectively by listening to each speaker in different sized\nspaces to see which could fill a room with dulcet tones, and which just filled\nit with cringe-inducing dissonance.\n\n  \n\nThe **Bose Soundlink Revolve+** has the most punch of any of the models we\ntested, earning a perfect 10 out of 10 in our volume testing. This speaker can\nreally blow your hair back. It had no problem filling our testing apartment\nwith sound, and could likely service a large backyard barbeque without having\nto max out the volume.\n\nSomewhat unsurprisingly the three largest speakers we tested, the **Harman\nKardon Onyx Studio 4** , the **JBL Charge 3** , and the newer **JBL Charge 4**\nwere all towards the top of the volume leaderboard, earning 9 out of 10\nscores. These models kept the music sounding good even when cranked up high,\nand could fill large, open houses with good sound. The **Onyx Studio 4** has\nbetter sound quality and, if anything, was just a tad louder than the\n**Charge** models, so it would be our top choice for playing music at a noisy\nbackyard barbecue. Just remember that it is the least portable speaker of the\nbunch.\n\nJust a little quieter but still loud enough to score 9 out 10 was the **Sony\nXB20** and its sibling, the **Sony SRS-XB32**. Both these models have enough\noomph to power a part of a large apartment but lack a bit of the over-the-top\nsound of the higher scoring models. The larger **Sony SRS-XB32** is also\nnoticeably louder than the smaller **XB20** , but not by enough of a margin to\nearn it a higher score.\n\nFor those looking for a smaller, more portable option that can still produce\nconsiderable volume there are a few options. The **JBL Flip 4** , the **Flip\n5** , and the **UE Boom 3** all earned 8 out of 10 in this metric while being\n_much_ smaller than most of the higher scoring models. These speakers easily\nproduce enough volume to keep a group of people in an apartment dancing, but\nmight be just a bit quiet for a larger party in an open space.\n\nThe **Bose SoundLink Revolve** and the **Bose SoundLink Color II** performed\nsimilarly, also scoring an 8. They have enough juice to power a small party\nand more than enough for a group of friends hanging out on the beach. The **UE\nWonderboom** produced a similar volume, also scoring an 8 out of 10.\n\n[![The JBL Charge 3's booming bass make it very loud  but somewhat to the\ndetriment of overall clarity.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/14/86/270167_7832_XXL.jpg)\n\nThe JBL Charge 3's booming bass make it very loud, but somewhat to the\ndetriment of overall clarity.\n\n  \n\nA few different models earned a 7 out of 10 in our volume metric. The **Sony\nXB10** , the **Bose SoundLink Mini II** , and the **Beats Pill+** were all\nable to fill our large testing apartment with sound. However, fill that\napartment with a lot of bodies and the sound gets a bit dimmer. You can still\nnotice the music, but it's not quite as loud.\n\nThe **Bose SoundLink Micro** , one of the smallest speakers in our testing,\nearned a 6 out of 10 for its volume capabilities. It's incredibly loud given\nits size, but it isn't going to fill much more than a large hotel room with\nloud music.\n\n[![The Beats Pill+ combines decent volume with great sound\nquality.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/14/87/270182_2599_XXL.jpg)\n\nThe Beats Pill+ combines decent volume with great sound quality.\n\n  \n\nWhen you get to the less expensive end of the portable speaker spectrum, you\nend up with models that aim only to be better and louder than your phone's\nbuilt-in speakers, and not much more. We tested several models that fall into\nthis category, including the **Tribit XSound Go** , the **Anker SoundCore 2**\n, and the **Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3**. All of these devices are\nloud enough for a small group of friends listening to music on the beach, but\nstruggle if the volume demands reach much beyond that.\n\n[![The Anker SoundCore 2 lasted over 40 hours in our battery life\ntesting.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/15/2/271764_16818_XXL.jpg)\n\nThe Anker SoundCore 2 lasted over 40 hours in our battery life testing.\n\n  \n\n### Battery Life\n\n  \n\nNothing can kill the mood of a gathering more than the music cutting out\nprematurely, so you want to make sure your speaker has enough juice to power\nyou through. To test battery life we set each speaker to the same level of\nsound output, which worked out to about 75% volume for most models, and made\nthem all play the same loop of music over and over until they died. We'd tell\nyou which songs we played, but at this point we've heard them so much we can't\neven stand to utter their names\u2026\n\n  \n\n**Anker** is probably best known for their portable battery packs, so it makes\nsense that the **SoundCore 2** would win our battery life test. It lasted an\nalmost ridiculous 42 hours on a single charge in our test. It got to the point\nthat we thought maybe there was some sort of magical perpetual-motion machine\ninside.\n\nThe **Anker** set an almost unattainable bar, as the closest competitor in our\ntests was the **JBL Charge 4**. It well outlasted its specified battery life,\npumping out music for a full 34.5 hours before it died. Its sibling, the **JBL\nCharge 3** , posted a similar performance, singing for 30 hours before giving\nway to entropy.\n\nAnother model that bested its specified runtime by a wide margin, the **JBL\nFlip 5** played on for 27 hours on a single charge in our testing.\n\nThe **UE Boom 3** and the **Bose SoundLink Revolve+** lasted a full day in our\ntest, both tapping out at the 24-hour mark.\n\nDropping back down into the teens, the **UE Wonderboom** posted an impressive\n19.5-hour battery life. The inexpensive **Tribit XSound Go** was just behind\nthe **Wonderboom** , lasting 18.5 hours before finally giving in to\nexhaustion.\n\n[![The Charge 3 lasted 30 hours in out battery life test  and was the only\nmodel that could even come close to the performance of the Anker\nSoundCore.](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/14/87/270188_6865_XXL.jpg)\n\nThe Charge 3 lasted 30 hours in out battery life test, and was the only model\nthat could even come close to the performance of the Anker SoundCore.\n\n  \n\nThe inexpensive **Cambridge Soundworks Oontz Angle 3** put up an impressive\n15.5 hours of playback in our test. The **JBL Flip 4** 's battery lagged just\nbehind, dying after 15 hours. The melodious **Bose SoundLink Color II** posted\nan impressive 13-hour battery life. Rounding out the double-digits in our test\nwas the **UE Boom 2** and the **Sony XB20** , both of which lasted 12 hours.\n\nThe **Bose Soundlink Micro** 's battery was only able to pump out music for\n4.5 hours in our test, making it the worst overall performer. Although it's\nhard to blame such a small speaker for having so short of a battery life, the\nlimited playtime for a particularly portable device feels a bit disappointing.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n  \nBluetooth speakers are wonderful little devices that let you and your friends\nenjoy music almost anywhere you go. They are also incredibly diverse, with\nthousands of different models flooding the market. We hope our research and\ntest results have helped you narrow the field to the few, or the one, speaker\nthat will best satisfy your portable music needs.\n\n  \n\u2014 _Max Mutter and Steven Tata_  \n  \n\n  * Share this article:\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techgearlab.com%2Ftopics%2Faudio%2Fbest-bluetooth-speaker \"Facebook\")\n  * [](https://www.twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Best+Bluetooth+Speaker+of+2020&via=TechGearLab&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techgearlab.com%2Ftopics%2Faudio%2Fbest-bluetooth-speaker \"Twitter\")\n  * [](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techgearlab.com%2Ftopics%2Faudio%2Fbest-bluetooth-speaker&media=https%3A%2F%2Ftechgearlab-mvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com%2Fphotos%2F14%2F92%2F270725_10508_L2.jpg&description=Best+Bluetooth+Speaker+of+2020+%7C+TechGearLab \"Pinterest\")\n  * [](mailto:?subject=Best+Bluetooth+Speaker+of+2020&body=https://www.techgearlab.com/topics/audio/best-bluetooth-speaker \"Email\")\n\nTable of Contents\n\n  * Our Picks\n  *     * Best Overall Bluetooth Speaker\n  *     * Best Bang for Your Buck\n  *     * Best Buy on a Shoestring Budget\n  *     * Best for Travel\n  *     * A Worthy, Waterproof, Bose Alternative\n  *     * Great for the Home and Backyard Parties\n  * Why You Should Trust Us\n  * Analysis and Test Results\n  *     * Value\n  *     * Sound Quality\n  *     * Portability\n  *     * Volume\n  *     * Battery Life\n  * Conclusion\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n[ ![Picking the Right Bluetooth Speaker for Your Needs](https://techgearlab-\nmvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)\n\n### Picking the Right Bluetooth Speaker for Your Needs\n\nBluetooth technology, which create short range wireless...\n](/topics/audio/best-bluetooth-speaker/buying-advice) [ ![The Best Drones of\n2020](https://techgearlab-mvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/images/shim.gif)\n\n### The Best Drones of 2020\n\nWant some Hollywood-style aerial footage?
