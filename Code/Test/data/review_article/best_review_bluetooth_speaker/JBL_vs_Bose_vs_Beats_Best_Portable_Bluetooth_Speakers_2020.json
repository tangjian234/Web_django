The JBL Charge 4 was\nreleased back in the summer of 2019, and JBL has easily retained command of\nthe portable audio industry. The previous JBL Charge models have been so good\nthat they only get knocked out of 1st place by the next Charge model and this\nyear is no different.\n\nWhile we wait for Beats and Bose to answer with comparable models, we have the\n2 best alternatives to the JBL Charge 4. The Beats Pill+ and the Bose\nSoundLink Revolve+ give JBL a run-for-their-money, and in more than one way.\nBefore we get to that, let\u2019s take a quick look at what\u2019s new with the JBL\nCharge 4 first.\n\n## 1\\. JBL Charge 4\n\n### Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\n[ ![#1 Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker: JBL Charge 4 Review - Superior Digital\nNews](https://i2.wp.com/superiordigitalnews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/JBL-Charge-4-Portable-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker.jpg?fit=1024%2C475&ssl=1) ](https://amzn.to/30aR3f2) #1 Best Portable\nBluetooth Speaker: JBL Charge 4 Review\n\n[ __ See on Amazon.com ](https://amzn.to/30aR3f2)\n\n> _**20 Hours of playback**_\n\n## PROS:\n\n  * WHAT\u2019S NEW! Improved bass response and more power (30 Watts)\n  * 20 Hours of playback (huge battery \u2013 7,800mAh) \n  * 10+ Colors to choose from: Black, Blue, Grey, Green, Pink, Red, Mustard, White, Teal, Gold, and Camouflage\n  * Pair 2 Charge 4\u2019s for stereo playback or\u2026\n  * Connect up to 100 other JBL connect+ compatible speakers for multi-room and indoor-outdoor playback\n  * **USB Charge Port Power Output;** Charges your phone, vape, ecig, or other small electronic devices\n  * IPX7 Waterproof and floats so you don\u2019t lose it if it goes overboard\n  * Super-durable fabric and rubber housing\n\n## CONS:\n\n  * JBL Companion app needs expanded EQ functionality. _For a portable speaker that\u2019s used in many different settings, it would be nice to have more BUILT-IN adjustments._\n  * No mic for speaker calls\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you want the all-around best portable Bluetooth speaker, then the [_JBL\nCharge 4_](https://amzn.to/2NqeTNg) is it. It\u2019s big sound and a big battery,\nbut packed in a compact and durable waterproof shell. With the 10+ color\noptions being merely icing on the cake, there are endless ways to\n_[accessorize](https://amzn.to/2QzGiPp)_ the Charge 4 Bluetooth Speaker Series\ntoo.  \n\n[ ![#1 Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker: JBL Charge 4 Review - Superior Digital\nNews](https://i2.wp.com/superiordigitalnews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/JBL-Charge-4-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker-Black-Charges-\nYour-Phone-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C853&ssl=1) ](https://amzn.to/34R2W8O) Charge your\nPhone, vape, ecig, or other portable electronic devices\n\n[ __ See on Amazon.com ](https://amzn.to/30aR3f2)\n\n![Superior Digital News | News, Reviews, and Deals on the best technology for\nhealth, fitness, and fun](https://i2.wp.com/superiordigitalnews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/06/Divider-SHORT-Circuit-Lines-SD-\nNews-3-07.png?fit=1024%2C17&ssl=1)\n\n## 2\\. Beats Pill+\n\n### Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\n[ ![#2 Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker: Beats Pill+ Review - Superior Digital\nNews](https://i0.wp.com/superiordigitalnews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/Beats-Pill-Portable-Speaker-White-Controls-and-\nFeatures.jpg?fit=1024%2C510&ssl=1) ](https://amzn.to/30qJmwR) #2 Best Portable\nBluetooth Speaker: Beats Pill+\n\n[ __ See on Amazon.com ](https://amzn.to/30qJmwR)\n\n> _**12 Hours of playback**_\n\n## PROS:\n\n  * 12 Hours of playback (slightly longer than average)\n  * 3 Colors to choose from: Black, Red, White\n  * **USB Charge Port Power Output;** Charge your phone, vape, ecig, or other small electronic devices\n  * Low profile design and fairly durable chassis\n  * Lighting Cable charging connection (iPhone user-friendly)\n\n## CONS:\n\n  * **Not Waterproof (Get with the program Dre!)**\n  * Extended bass frequency is good for pop and hip hop music but can make other genres sound \u201cmuddy\u201d\n  * Battery life is so-so, especially if you use it to charge your phone and other devices\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhat the [_Beats Pill+_](https://amzn.to/30fK3hm) lacks in battery life and\nsound quality, it makes up in portability and compatibility. Since Apple\nbought Beats over 5 years ago, they\u2019ve done a great job of only aligning\nspecific features to the Apple environment.\n\nBefore the merger, Apple and [_Beats_](https://amzn.to/2Ohkrtf) already had 2\nthings in common. Their products were some of the best in their industry, but\nthey\u2019re also a little overpriced. In the end, their minimalist design style\nand dedication to high quality products are two reasons it\u2019s a match made in\nheaven. **With the switch to an Apple Lightning charger connection, the Beats\nPill+ fits right into the Apple users environment.**\n\nNow that the price is below $125 on Amazon, in our opinion, it\u2019s the best\noption for Apple-lovers on-the-go. No, it\u2019s not as tough as the Charge 4 and\nit doesn\u2019t sound as good as the Bose SoundLink Revolve+. It\u2019s the compact\nsize, compared to the BIG sound that makes it the perfect travel buddy.\n\n[ ![#2 Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker: Beats Pill+ Review - Superior Digital\nNews](https://i1.wp.com/superiordigitalnews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/Beats-Pill-Portable-Speaker.jpg?fit=1024%2C557&ssl=1)\n](https://amzn.to/30qJmwR) #2 Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker: Beats Pill+\n\n[ __ See on Amazon.com ](https://amzn.to/30qJmwR)\n\n![Superior Digital News | News, Reviews, and Deals on the best technology for\nhealth, fitness, and fun](https://i2.wp.com/superiordigitalnews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/06/Divider-SHORT-Circuit-Lines-SD-\nNews-3-07.png?fit=1024%2C17&ssl=1)\n\n[\n![](https://www.lduhtrp.net/image-9115023-14079933)](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-9115023-14079933)\n\n![Superior Digital News | News, Reviews, and Deals on the best technology for\nhealth, fitness, and fun](https://i2.wp.com/superiordigitalnews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/06/Divider-SHORT-Circuit-Lines-SD-\nNews-3-07.png?fit=1024%2C17&ssl=1)\n\n## 3\\. Bose SoundLink Revolve+\n\n### Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\n[ ![#3 Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker: Bose Soundlink Revolve+ Review -\nSuperior Digital News](https://i1.wp.com/superiordigitalnews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/Bose-Soundlink-Revolve-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker-\nEasy-Carry-Handle.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&ssl=1) ](https://amzn.to/31xlTLO) #3 Best\nPortable Bluetooth Speaker: Bose SoundLink Revolve+\n\n[ __ See on Amazon.com ](https://amzn.to/32RYDZ3)\n\n> _**16 Hours of playback**_\n\n## PROS:\n\n  * 16 Hours of playback\n  * Best all-around sound quality; 360\u00b0 immersive sound\n  * IPX Water-resistant\n  * Pair 2 for stereo playback or mono for multi-room playback\n  * Simple, elegant and tough design\n  * Comes with Revolve Charging Cradle so it always stays \u201ctopped off\u201d and ready to go\n\n## CONS:\n\n  * **No USB port to charge your phone, vape, ecig, or other small electronic devices**\n  * **Most expensive** , but is well worth the investment in sound-quality alone\n  * Only 2 colors to choose!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe all know Bose is king when it comes to studio and home audio products. When\nit comes to [_portable Bluetooth speakers_](https://amzn.to/2LEizc7), in\nparticular, they haven\u2019t been as consistent though. From weird color options\nto durability issues, they\u2019ve dropped the ball a few times over the years. We\nfind it funny that instead of finding better colors options for their latest\nSoundLink models, they just avoided offering colors altogether. _#SMH_  \n  \nThe [_Bose SoundLink Revolve+_](https://amzn.to/30wD66s) was instantly one of\nour top 3 choices back in 2017 when it was released. Now it remains mainly\nbecause there\u2019s still no MID-SIZE portable Bluetooth speaker that sounds\nbetter. Even though you only have a choice between Triple Black and Lux Gray,\nthe jaw-dropping sound quality is what really makes them stand out.\n\n[ ![#3 Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker: Bose Soundlink Revolve+ Review -\nSuperior Digital News](https://i1.wp.com/superiordigitalnews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/Bose-Soundlink-Revolve-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker-\nCharge-Port-and-Built-In-Handle.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024&ssl=1)\n](https://amzn.to/31E83ao) #3 Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker: Bose SoundLink\nRevolve+\n\n[ __ See on Amazon.com ](https://amzn.to/31xlTLO)\n\n![Superior Digital News | News, Reviews, and Deals on the best technology for\nhealth, fitness, and fun](https://i2.wp.com/superiordigitalnews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/06/Divider-SHORT-Circuit-Lines-SD-\nNews-3-07.png?fit=1024%2C17&ssl=1)\n\n## Wildcard: Crave Curve\n\n### Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\n[ ![Crave-Curve-Premium-Portable-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker](https://i2.wp.com/superiordigitalnews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/Crave-Curve-Premium-Portable-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker.jpg?fit=1024%2C554&ssl=1)\n](https://cravedirect.com/collections/earphones/products/curve-\nspeaker?rfsn=4245758.2c31ad) Crave Curve Premium Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\n> _**10 Hours of playback**_\n\n## PROS:\n\n  * Beautiful aluminum finish gives it a premium look and feel\n  * 20W power and 90Hz-20,000Hz frequency range puts out crisp and clear audio, even at higher volumes\n  * Bluetooth pairing is very quick, especially after initial pairing with device\n  * 10 Hours of playback\n  * Full control of music with speaker control buttons; skip songs forward and back by long pressing volume buttons\n\n## CONS:\n\n  * No water and dust-resistance rating displayed on the specs list\n  * Aluminum finish is susceptible to scratches and dents\n  * Only going down to 90Hz frequency response cuts off a lot of bass if you listen to Hip Hop, R&B, and other Pop music\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCompared to the other portable Bluetooth speakers on our list, the Crave Curve\nis a little more delicate. The beautiful aluminum finish will definitely show\nsome wear-and-tear over time, if you want to throw it in your backpack like\nthe JBL Charge 4 and Beats Pill+. On the other hand, the Curve serves as the\nperfect office, RV, or bookshelf speaker. The audio quality is comparable to\nthe [**_JBL Flip series_**](https://amzn.to/3eAizFA), so there\u2019s no sacrifice\nwhen it comes to sound output.\n\nWe don\u2019t recommend outdoor use with the Curve since we aren\u2019t given water and\ndust-resistance ratings, so keep it away from the weather. The built-in mic\nmakes the perfect office assistant for conference calls, Zoom meetings, and\nFacetime. In true Crave fashion, the minimalist design fits with virtually any\nstyle and gives it a professional look. If you\u2019re not familiar with the Crave\nbrand, they offer many different mobile accessories.\n\n[ Get 10% OFF And FREE SHIPPING @ Crave.com  \nUSE CODE: SDN10\n](https://cravedirect.com/collections/earphones/products/curve-\nspeaker?rfsn=4245758.2c31ad)\n\n[ ![Crave Curve - Premium Sound\nQuality](https://i1.wp.com/superiordigitalnews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/Crave-Curve-Premium-Sound-\nQuality.jpg?fit=1024%2C903&ssl=1)\n](https://cravedirect.com/collections/earphones/products/curve-\nspeaker?rfsn=4245758.2c31ad) Crave Curve - Premium Sound Quality\n\n### Share This Review On...\n\n__ Share on facebook\n\n__ Share on twitter\n\n__ Share on pinterest\n\n__ Share on reddit\n\n__ Share on email\n\n![Superior Digital News | News, Reviews, and Deals on the best technology for\nhealth, fitness, and fun](https://i2.wp.com/superiordigitalnews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/06/Divider-SHORT-Circuit-Lines-SD-\nNews-3-07.png?fit=1024%2C17&ssl=1)\n\n## BONUS PICKS: Runner Ups\n\nGetting down to the Top 3 Portable Bluetooth Speakers was difficult and we had\nto leave out some really cool options.
