Every major audio manufacturer has at least one model on\nthe market today, and most have several. If you haven\u2019t listened to a\nBluetooth speaker lately, you\u2019re in for a very pleasant surprise.\n\n## Bluetooth speaker cheat sheet\n\n  * Best budget Bluetooth speaker:Tronsmart Element Force SoundPulse Bluetooth speaker\n  * Best mid-priced Bluetooth speaker:Oppo Sonica Wi-Fi Speaker\n  * Best high-end Bluetooth speaker:Bluesound Pulse Mini 2i\n  * Best bookshelf Bluetooth speaker:Edifier S2000 Pro\n  * Best outdoor Bluetooth speaker:Soundcast VG7 \n  * Best price-is-no-barrier Bluetooth speaker:Naim Mu-so 2nd Generation\n\nThe industry\u2019s progress doesn\u2019t mean that every Bluetooth speaker justifies\nits price tag, no matter how inexpensive it might be. There\u2019s still plenty of\ndreck floating around. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re here to help you steer clear of the\njunk and point you to the best speakers at the price range that fits your\nbudget.\n\nTo that end, we\u2019ve picked the best Bluetooth speakers (and runners-up in some\ncases) in six categories: budget, mid-range (up to $300), outdoor, bookshelf,\nhigh-end (up to $750), and\u2014yes, there are ultra-high-end Bluetooth\nspeakers\u2014price is no object. Some of our picks can be used indoors and out,\nbut we\u2019ve also named our favorites that are designed _primarily_ as outdoor\nspeakers.\n\n_**Updated June 25, 2020** to add our [Anker Soundcore Rave Neo\nreview](https://www.techhive.com/article/3123762/best-bluetooth-\nspeakers.html). This largeish speaker targets one audience--dance partiers--\nand delivers what those folks are looking for: Deep bass at high volume,\naccompanied by a color LED light show. But don't let its looks fool you: It\nsounds a lot better than you might expect._\n\n## Best budget Bluetooth speaker\n\n######\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3384711/tronsmart-element-force-review-\nthis-small-and-inexpensive-bluetooth-speaker-produces-high-\nquality-s.html)[Tronsmart Element Force SoundPulse Bluetooth\nspeaker](https://www.techhive.com/article/3384711/tronsmart-element-force-\nreview-this-small-and-inexpensive-bluetooth-speaker-produces-high-\nquality-s.html)\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3384711/tronsmart-element-force-review-\nthis-small-and-inexpensive-bluetooth-speaker-produces-high-quality-s.html)\n\n[Read TechHive's review](https://www.techhive.com/article/3384711/tronsmart-\nelement-force-review-this-small-and-inexpensive-bluetooth-speaker-produces-\nhigh-quality-s.html)\n\nMSRP $59.99\n\nSee it\n\nThis mighty mite produces shockingly good sound for its size and price\u2014but\nonly in its Extra Bass EQ mode\u2014and it's water resistant to boot.\n\nThe Bluetooth speaker market is a cutthroat business when you get to this\nprice range. The good news for music lovers is that you can find some very\ngood products here. If $60 is too much for your budget, consider our runner-\nup, the Aukey SK-S1 (see below). Otherwise, we can\u2019t say enough good things\nabout the Tronsmart Element Force SoundPulse, which features IPX7\nweatherization, support for True Wireless Stereo (so you can operate two of\nthem as a stereo pair), and absolutely fantastic sound (in Extra Bass EQ mode,\nthat is). That\u2019s a lot of speaker for just 60 bucks.\n\n### Runner-up\n\n######\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3287976/aukey-sk-s1-review.html)[Aukey\nSK-S1 Bluetooth speaker](https://www.techhive.com/article/3287976/aukey-\nsk-s1-review.html)\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3287976/aukey-sk-s1-review.html)\n\n[Read TechHive's review](https://www.techhive.com/article/3287976/aukey-\nsk-s1-review.html)\n\nMSRP $39.99\n\nSee it\n\nThis Bluetooth speaker is meant to look good on your desktop, not the pool. It\nalso sounds quite nice at low volumes. Given the price, and speaker phone\nfunctionality, it's pretty much the perfect workplace audio accoutrement.\n\nThe Aukey SK-S1 doesn\u2019t have all the features\u2014or audio power\u2014of our top pick\nin this category, but it is an attractively designed near-field speaker that\u2019s\nfabricated mostly from metal, where you might expect to find ABS plastic. And\nit sounds very good\u2014at least until you push it to the edge. It\u2019s not the right\nchoice to fill a room, and it\u2019s not at all protected from the weather, but it\nis a great deal for the money,\n\n## Best mid-priced Bluetooth speaker\n\n######\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3561528/fluance-ai60-review.html)[Fluance\nAi60](https://www.techhive.com/article/3561528/fluance-ai60-review.html)\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3561528/fluance-ai60-review.html)\n\n[Read TechHive's review](https://www.techhive.com/article/3561528/fluance-\nai60-review.html)\n\nSee it\n\nThe Fluance Ai60 offers spectacular sound quality with amazingly deep bass for\nfar less than I would have expected. They're large, but definitely in charge!\n\nThese Bluetooth bookshelf speakers blew us away with their impeccable\nperformance for the price, comparing favorably with a competing pair that cost\nnearly four times as much. We were particularly impressed with their frequency\nrange and their ability to dig deep into the low-frequency realm, all the way\ndown to 35Hz. Highly recommended if you're looking for high-fidelity audio on\na budget.\n\n## Best high-end Bluetooth speaker\n\n######\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3340321/bluesound-pulse-\nmini-2i-review.html)[Bluesound Pulse Mini\n2i](https://www.techhive.com/article/3340321/bluesound-pulse-\nmini-2i-review.html)\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3340321/bluesound-pulse-\nmini-2i-review.html)\n\n[Read TechHive's review](https://www.techhive.com/article/3340321/bluesound-\npulse-mini-2i-review.html)\n\nMSRP $499.00\n\nSee it\n\nBetter sounding than the original, the Pulse Mini 2i can also now be\ncontrolled via Alexa and it supports AirPlay 2. For the price you can't do\nbetter.\n\nIn addition to Bluetooth, you can control this speaker over Wi-Fi with\nBluesound\u2019s apps for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows; it can be part of a\nmulti-room audio system with other Bluesound speakers or other speakers that\nsupport Apple\u2019s AirPlay 2 technology; you can configure two of them as a\nstereo pair; it supports the aptX HD codec for streaming high-resolution\naudio; and it features a bi-directional Bluetooth radio, so you can stream\nmusic to it and listen to music from it using Bluetooth headphones. It goes\nwithout saying this speaker sounds absolutely divine. Highly recommended.\n\n## Best outdoor Bluetooth speaker\n\n######\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3201968/soundcast-vg7-outdoor-bluetooth-\nspeaker-review-a-wonderful-speaker-indoors-or-out.html)[Soundcast VG7\n](https://www.techhive.com/article/3201968/soundcast-vg7-outdoor-bluetooth-\nspeaker-review-a-wonderful-speaker-indoors-or-out.html)\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3201968/soundcast-vg7-outdoor-bluetooth-\nspeaker-review-a-wonderful-speaker-indoors-or-out.html)\n\n[Read TechHive's review](https://www.techhive.com/article/3201968/soundcast-\nvg7-outdoor-bluetooth-speaker-review-a-wonderful-speaker-indoors-or-out.html)\n\nMSRP $799.99\n\nSee it\n\nYes, you'll experience sticker shock. But it's been nearly 10 years since\nwe've heard a powered, portable, outdoor speaker as good as this one,\n\nThis is the best powered outdoor speaker we\u2019ve heard since Soundcast\nintroduced its Outcast speaker nearly 10 years ago. It\u2019s built like a tank;\nsplash resistant, so you can use it poolside or at the beach; and it delivers\noutstanding battery life. Most importantly, however, it sounds fantastic.\nExpensive, but worth it.\n\n### Runner-up\n\n######\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3439397/sonos-move-review.html)[Sonos\nMove](https://www.techhive.com/article/3439397/sonos-move-review.html)\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3439397/sonos-move-review.html)\n\n[Read TechHive's review](https://www.techhive.com/article/3439397/sonos-move-\nreview.html)\n\nMSRP $399.00\n\nSee it\n\nThe Sonos Move is a fantastic portable speaker and a rugged, weatherized\ncomponent of one of the world\u2019s preeminent multi-room audio systems.\n\nThe Soundcast VG7 won\u2019t fit everyone\u2019s budget, and while the Sonos Move isn\u2019t\nexactly inexpensive, it\u2019s engineered to withstand the elements, it sounds\nfantastic, and it\u2019s supremely flexible, being able to stream music via either\nBluetooth or Wi-Fi. Highly recommended.\n\n## Best price-is-no-limit Bluetooth speaker\n\n######\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3435399/naim-mu-so-2nd-generation-\nreview.html)[Naim Mu-so 2nd\nGeneration](https://www.techhive.com/article/3435399/naim-mu-so-2nd-\ngeneration-review.html)\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3435399/naim-mu-so-2nd-generation-\nreview.html)\n\n[Read TechHive's review](https://www.techhive.com/article/3435399/naim-mu-\nso-2nd-generation-review.html)\n\nMSRP $1,599.00\n\nSee it\n\nThe Naim Audio Mu-so 2nd Generation is a pricey all-in-home home audio\nsolution, but it\u2019s supremely capable, incredibly flexible, and it sounds like\nheaven.\n\nThe Naim Mu-so 2nd Generation is, of course, much more than a Bluetooth\nspeaker.It has a dual-band Wi-Fi adapter onboard, so you can use it in a\nmulti-room audio system with other Naim components, any speaker that supports\nApple\u2019s AirPlay 2 technology, or anything that\u2019s Chromecast compatible. It can\nplay music on any connected USB storage device, and it can connect to any UPnP\nserver on your network. It\u2019s Roon Ready, too. Finally, it supports Spotify\nConnect and you can stream music from Tidal without leaving the Naim app. Oh,\nand it\u2019s capable of decoding high-resolution music encoded at up to 32-bit\nresolution and at sampling rates as high as 384kHz. All that and it sounds\namazing.\n\n### Runner-up\n\n######\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3296760/shinola-bookshelf-speakers-\nreview.html)[Shinola Bookshelf\nSpeakers](https://www.techhive.com/article/3296760/shinola-bookshelf-speakers-\nreview.html)\n\n[](https://www.techhive.com/article/3296760/shinola-bookshelf-speakers-\nreview.html)\n\n[Read TechHive's review](https://www.techhive.com/article/3296760/shinola-\nbookshelf-speakers-review.html)\n\n[$1,500.00](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shinola.com%2Faudio%2Fall%2Fspeakers.html&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techhive.com%2Farticle%2F3123762%2Fbest-\nbluetooth-speakers.html&xcust=US_003_3123762_005_1441405_web)MSRP $1,500.00\n\n[See\nit](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shinola.com%2Faudio%2Fall%2Fspeakers.html&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techhive.com%2Farticle%2F3123762%2Fbest-\nbluetooth-speakers.html&xcust=US_003_3123762_005_1441405_web)\n\n[on\nShinola](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shinola.com%2Faudio%2Fall%2Fspeakers.html&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techhive.com%2Farticle%2F3123762%2Fbest-\nbluetooth-speakers.html&xcust=US_003_3123762_005_1441405_web)\n\nShinola\u2019s compact, minimalist self-powered speakers offer big, bright, and\nbold performances from almost any source, analog or digital, hardwired or via\nBluetooth.\n\nThe soundbar-like design of Naim\u2019s Mu-so Bluetooth speaker isn\u2019t for everyone.\nIf you want elegantly designed high-end speakers you can connect to via\nBluetooth (and lots of wired ways, too), Shinola (and its design partner,\nstudio-monitor builder Barefoot Sound) have what you\u2019re looking for. Named\nsimply Shinola Bookshelf Speakers, these loudspeakers sound every bit as\nbeautiful as they look.\n\n## Features to look for in a Bluetooth speaker\n\nNot convinced the picks we\u2019ve listed above are exactly right for you? This\nguide will help you sort through the facts, figures, and specs to determine\nwhich speaker will best meet your needs. Your first decision will be to choose\nbetween mobile and stationary form factors. The majority of Bluetooth speakers\nare portable because they get paired with mobile phones, but more and more\nmanufacturers are introducing models designed to remain inside the home.\n\nChoosing a portable model gives you the best of both worlds in some respects,\nbut a stationary speaker is more apt to blend into your home\u2019s decor. And\nwhile we\u2019ve heard some pretty spectacular portable Bluetooth speakers, a plug-\nin model is more likely to produce the sound you\u2019re looking for if fidelity is\npriority one in your book.\n\nHere are the features you\u2019ll want to evaluate in a Bluetooth speaker:\n\n[](https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2016/08/megaboom-\napp-100675739-orig.png) Theo Nicolakis\n\n **App support** : Companion apps can provide lots of additional features to a\nspeaker that wouldn\u2019t be possible with just physical buttons on the speaker\nitself. The app might enable more than one person to be the DJ, queuing up\nsongs to play on the speaker. An app might enable you to create customized EQ\ncurves for different styles of music, create wake-up alarms, or power the\nspeaker on and off remotely.\n\n **aptX support** : Bluetooth audio must be squeezed down in order to stream\nover the airwaves, and the default codec use lossy compression that throws\nsome of the musical data away. Qualcomm\u2019s aptX codec is lossless, so none of\nthe musical detail is lost in the process. But aptX must be present at both\nends of the stream, in the playback device and in the speaker. Most Android\ndevices support aptX, but Apple devices do not.\n\n **aptX HD support** : This version of Qualcomm\u2019s codec supports high-\nresolution audio files, but it\u2019s hard to find even in the highest-end\nBluetooth speakers right now. As with its sibling, the codec must be supported\non both the audio source and the speaker in order to work.\n\n **Battery** : Next to fidelity, a portable speaker\u2019s most important feature\nis how long it can operate when it\u2019s not plugged into the wall. You should\nexpect a battery to last 10 to 20 hours, but remember that the bigger the\nbattery, the heavier the speaker will be.\n\n[](https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2015/09/sound-blaster-\nroar-2_contro-100617257-orig.jpg) Michael Brown\n\n **Charging options** : If your speaker has a battery, it will need to be\ncharged. Speakers that charge their batteries via a USB port are more\nconvenient than models that require an AC adapter, but larger batteries might\nnot offer that option. Some speakers also let you plug in a USB cable to tap\ntheir battery to charge your smartphone.\n\n **DSP:** An onboard digital signal processor (DSP) lets you electronically\nchange how the speaker is driven in order to compensate for speaker placement\nor the acoustical properties of your room, among other things.\n\n **Mounting options and accessories** : A portable speaker should be easy to\ntake with you. While some Bluetooth speakers count on their size to make them\neasy to grip, others provide a lanyard, carabiner clip, or a shoulder strap.\nIt\u2019s even more handy when the manufacturer provides standardized sockets and\naccessories for mounting the speaker to an object, such as your bike\u2019s\nhandlebars.\n\n[](https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2016/05/1n0a2046-100659795-orig.jpg)\nAltec Lansing\n\nSome portable Bluetooth speakers are small enough that you can grip them in\nyour hand, but it provide thread mounts so you can attach them\n\n **Speakerphone** : Some Bluetooth speakers have built-in microphones that\nenable you to use the speaker as a speakerphone in concert with your\nsmartphone. The sound quality will be much better than what you\u2019ll get from\nyour phone, and you\u2019ll be able to turn the volume up much higher. This can be\nvery handy for conference calls.\n\n **Stereo pairing** : Some speakers let you create a left/right stereo pair\nwith two speakers (this works best, of course, when the two speakers are\nidentical).\n\n **Weatherization** : Portable Bluetooth speakers can be used indoors and out,\nso the best models provide some protection from the elements. Ideally, the\nmanufacturer will let you know just how much protection you can expect by\nproviding an IP (International Protection) marking. The first digit rates the\nenclosure\u2019s protection from particulate matter (e.g., dust) and the second\ndigit rates its protection against liquids.\n\n[](https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2015/06/backfloatsplash-3-100590089-orig.jpg)\n\nAn IP64 code, for instance, indicates that the speaker is completely protected\nfrom dust (6) and from water splashed onto it (4). The higher the numbers, the\nmore protection you can expert If either digit is replaced by an X\u2014IPX4, for\nexample\u2014the code indicates that the speaker isn\u2019t rated for protection from\nparticles (this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s _not_ protected from things\nlike dust, just that the manufacturer doesn\u2019t rate its protection).\n\n **Wi-Fi** : Higher-priced Bluetooth speakers also provide the option of\nconnecting to your Wi-Fi network, so that you can stream music from a NAS box.\nWi-Fi streams will offer higher fidelity than Bluetooth, even if the speaker\nsupports the aptX codec. A speaker that provides for a hardwired network\nconnection is all the more versatile.\n\n **Wireless range:** A Bluetooth speaker\u2019s range depends on the power class of\nits radio, and it can vary widely and is impacted by the environment that it\u2019s\noperating in. A Class 1 radio offers range of approximately 100 meters, but\nthe number of walls between the Bluetooth source and the speaker and the type\nof materials in those walls will have a significant impact on range. It\u2019s much\neasier for radio waves to pass through drywall than masonry, for instance.\nObjects in the signal path, such as large metal appliances, will reduce that\nrange even further.\n\n## Our latest Bluetooth speaker reviews\n\nNote: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may\nearn a small commission.
