If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small\nshare of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA\nToday\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives._\n\nThe weather is getting warmer, and hopefully that means it's time for summer\nfun: cookouts, trips to the beach, hikes, and time spent beside the pool. One\nthing that will drastically improve all those things? A portable speaker that\ncan play your favorite music.\n\nWe've spent months testing dozens of the most popular and highly-rated\nspeakers on the market. We talked to manufacturers, we read hundreds of user\nreviews, and we conducted our own in-house testing to find the best Bluetooth\nspeaker right now\u2014including everything from cheap $30 models to higher-end\nwaterproof ones.\n\nThese are the best Bluetooth speakers you can buy:\n\n## Best For Most People: JBL Flip 4\n\n![JBL Flip 4](https://www.gannett-\ncdn.com/-mm-/00328455916bb45ca99246179b52b99baca14f7b/c=0-0-642-361/local/-/media/2019/06/05/USATODAY/usatsports/Reviewed.com-\nRvEW-22825-PortableSpeaker.jpg?width=580&height=326&fit=crop)\n\nJBL Flip 4 (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nThe [JBL Flip 4 ($75 on\nsale)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSYQWNY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=usatsyndication-20&linkId=7bf256f60dd75559a27b3aa5c6e8adea&language=en_US)\nisn't the cheapest speaker we tested, but there's a reason: it sounds awesome,\nit's waterproof, and it boasts beefier battery life than smaller options. It's\nso good we named it the Best Overall in our roundups of both the [best\nportable](https://www.reviewed.com/televisions/best-right-now/the-best-\nportable-bluetooth-speakers) and the [best waterproof Bluetooth\nspeakers](https://www.reviewed.com/televisions/best-right-now/the-best-\nwaterproof-bluetooth-speakers).\n\nFrom the knock-resistant hard plastic chassis to the cleanly spaced volume,\nplay, and Bluetooth buttons, the Flip 4 stands out from the collective a bit\nin terms of pure polish and quality. It's not the loudest speaker on the list\nbut it provides a good balance of bass, midtones, and treble frequencies. It's\nlighter than smaller speakers, which definitely adds to its overall\nportability, and is available in a wide range of colors like blue, red, teal,\nand even camo (yikes).\n\nIf you need waterproofing, outdoorsy sturdiness, good volume, and the ability\nto connect more than one Bluetooth source at a time, the Flip 4 is one of the\nbest choices. It also delivers more impressive, rumbling bass than almost\nanything else we tested. No matter how you plan to use it\u2014indoor, outdoor,\ndry, wet, stationary, or in motion\u2014the Flip 4 delivers the goods.\n\n **[Get the JBL Flip 4 at Amazon for\n$74.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSYQWNY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=usatsyndication-20&linkId=7bf256f60dd75559a27b3aa5c6e8adea&language=en_US)95**\n\n## Best Cheap Bluetooth Speaker: Anker Soundcore 2\n\n![Kick your spontaneous dance party up a notch.](https://www.gannett-\ncdn.com/presto/2019/06/04/USAT/e7bc0e3c-40d2-4692-b18d-ba1d5ee73d61-anker-\nsoundcore.jpg?width=580&height=326&fit=bounds&auto=webp)\n\nKick your spontaneous dance party up a notch. (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey\nGoldwasser)\n\nIf you just want an affordable, waterproof Bluetooth speaker with no gimmicks,\nthe [**Anker Soundcore 2 ($29.99 on sale)**](https://www.amazon.com/Upgraded-\nAnker-Soundcore-Bluetooth-\nWaterproof/dp/B01MTB55WH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?SubscriptionId=AKIAJIYMMIJN7RU7KVJQ&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=usatsyndication-20&linkId=c4d8b23d48435a65db19334d8ca23987&language=en_US)\nis the way to go. It features a sturdy rectangular design with big, easy-to-\npush buttons and a very tightly sealed set of inputs, including USB for\ncharging and a 3.5mm aux port for audio.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the SoundCore 2 was its sound quality. For\nbeing small, portable, and fairly lightweight\u2014not to mention cheap at under\n$50\u2014it has less tinniness in its trebles and more bass presence than other\nspeakers.\n\nBetween the low price point and the wide array of colors, it's the best\nBluetooth speaker for the money, bar none. It doesn't get incredibly loud, but\nit's enough for a party or small barbecue\u2014all without a touch of distortion.\n\nMost impressive? It's waterproof (rated to IPX7, which you can learn more\nabout in our guide to [what waterproof ratings actually\nmean](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/features/what-do-waterproof-and-\nwater-resistant-really-mean)), a big improvement over the original Anker\nSoundcore, which was already one of the best cheap Bluetooth speakers of all\ntime. If you want a Bluetooth speaker on a budget, this is the one to get.\n\n[ **Get the Anker Soundcore 2 at Amazon for $29.99 with\ncoupon**](https://www.amazon.com/Upgraded-Anker-Soundcore-Bluetooth-\nWaterproof/dp/B01MTB55WH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?SubscriptionId=AKIAJIYMMIJN7RU7KVJQ&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=usatsyndication-20&linkId=c4d8b23d48435a65db19334d8ca23987&language=en_US)\n\n **Other Bluetooth Speakers We Liked**\n\n[ **Aomis Sport II ($32.99 with coupon at\nAmazon)**](https://www.amazon.com/AOMAIS-Portable-Wireless-Bluetooth-\nWaterproof/dp/B01K9NLCV8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAJIYMMIJN7RU7KVJQ&linkCode=sl1&tag=usatsyndication-20&linkId=781c6652e5c73a7de77cbd5cf0d2b482&language=en_US):\nThis was a surprisingly good, cheap Bluetooth speaker that came in second in\nour roundup of the [best cheap Bluetooth\nspeakers](https://www.reviewed.com/televisions/best-right-now/the-best-cheap-\nportable-bluetooth-speakers). We'd recommend going with the Anker Soundcore or\nthe waterproof Soundcore 2, but this is a good alternative\u2014just clip the on-\npage coupon to get the price this low.\n\n[ **Bose Soundlink Revolve ($179 at Amazon)**](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-\nSoundLink-Portable-\nBluetooth-739523-1110/dp/B06XCQKTKR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=soundlink+revolve&qid=1559669532&s=electronics&sr=1-4&linkCode=sl1&tag=usatsyndication-20&linkId=6c42bff6d8d33330bc931865b6386b6c&language=en_US):\nThis Bose wireless Bluetooth speaker has a lot going for it, including\nexcellent sound quality and a cool design. But it's also $179 on Amazon right\nnow\u2014the [newest Bose Revolve+ is actually even more expensive at\n$249](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Portable-Long-Lasting-\nBluetooth/dp/B06XCW4VFS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=soundlink+revolve&qid=1559669532&s=electronics&sr=1-3&linkCode=sl1&tag=usatsyndication-20&linkId=5148495f2184f475c2b4384229db1a97&language=en_US).\nWe just think the JBL Flip 4 is a better option for the money. The Bose will\nsound better in most instances, but for nearly three times the price that's a\ntough sell.\n\n[Anker Soundcore Flare+ ($99.99 at Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-\nPortable-Bluetooth-Waterproof-\nRadiators/dp/B07F7VJN1G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?SubscriptionId=AKIAJIYMMIJN7RU7KVJQ&linkCode=sl1&tag=usatsyndication-20&linkId=710cecd95a267511bcce439266766d3c&language=en_US):\nThis $99.99 waterproof speaker ($79.99 on sale now and then) doesn't offer a\nton more than the other Soundcore models. But it has flashing LED lights on\nthe bottom that sync with your music, which might be worth it if you are using\nthis at a party.\n\n_The product experts at[Reviewed](https://www.reviewed.com/) have
