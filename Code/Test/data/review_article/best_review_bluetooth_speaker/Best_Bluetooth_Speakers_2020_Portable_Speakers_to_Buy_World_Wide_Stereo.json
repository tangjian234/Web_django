At a glance, the two look almost identical,\nthough the Charge 4 is slightly bigger all around (by less than an inch) and\nheavier (by about half a pound) as a result of the bigger, longer-lasting\nbattery inside. The Charge 4 also comes wrapped in the same IPX-7 durable\nwaterproof material and rugged rubber housing, making it an ideal choice for\npoolside parties, camping trips, the car \u2013 or anywhere, really. It doesn\u2019t\ncome with a microphone inside so you can\u2019t take phone calls on it, but it does\ncome with Bluetooth 4.2 and \u201cJBL Connect,\u201d which lets you connect up to 2\nsmartphones or tablets and up to 100 JBL speakers.*\n\nTurned up, the Charge 4\u2019s dual exposed passive radiators provide some serious\npunching power. Bass response is outstanding \u2013 almost miraculous given the\nCharge 4\u2019s size \u2013 which is what made the Charge 3 such a runaway best-seller.\nChoose from a variety of colors, get up to 20 hours of playtime, and share the\nsame Bluetooth connection with a friend \u2013 the JBL Charge 4 is a solid choice.\n\n **Dimensions:** 8.66 x 3.74 x 3.66 in (W x H x D) | **Weight:** 2.12 lbs. |\n**Warranty:** 1 year | ******Battery Life:** Up to 20 Hours | ** ****\nWaterproof Rating: **IPX7 **| Powerbank Capability:** Via USB **| Stereo\nPairing:** Yes **  \n**\n\n **Reg Price:** **** $179.95  \n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.worldwidestereo.com/products/jbl-charge-4-portable-\nbluetooth-speaker)\n\n## #2\\.

Quite simply \u2013 they\u2019re that good. JBL was among the first to see the\npotential for Bluetooth speakers and they jumped in early, dedicating huge\nresources to developing a smart, robust, \u201csomething-for-everyone\u201d product line\n\u2013 and the JBL Clip 3 is a great example.\n\nOur opinion: the Clip 3 is the best on-the-go, small speaker you can buy \u2013 bar\nnone. It clips to your belt or purse via a sturdy carabiner, and it can take a\nserious hit (yes, it even works if it falls in your beer). It also has a\nmicrophone inside which makes it a hands-free speakerphone, and it offers 10\nhours of playtime between charges. The Clip 3 comes wrapped in a rugged\nrubberized housing (that feels nice to the touch) and you can choose from\namong 10 vibrant colors. Best of all, the overall sound is excellent in spite\nof the Clip 3\u2019s diminutive size (5.4\u201d by 3.8\u201d by 1.8\u201d) and less-than-$100\nprice tag.\n\nBottom line: if you\u2019re still listening to the speaker in your phone when\nstreaming music, podcasts or whatever \u2013 stop. Consider this an intervention \u2013\nput the Clip 3 in your cart right now; we're confident you'll love it.\n\n **Dimensions:** 3.8 x 5.4 x 1.8 in (W x H x D) | **Weight:** 0.5 lbs. |\n**Warranty:** 1 year | ******Battery Life:** Up to 10 Hours | ** ****\nWaterproof Rating: **IPX7 **  \n**\n\n **Reg Price:** $69.95\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.worldwidestereo.com/products/jbl-clip-3-portable-\nbluetooth-waterproof-speaker)\n\n## #3\\. Best Bluetooth Speaker Under $100: [Bose SoundLink Micro Bluetooth\nWaterproof Speaker](https://www.worldwidestereo.com/products/bose-soundlink-\nmicro-bluetooth-waterproof-speaker?color=Black)\n\n  \n\n[ ![Bose SoundLink Micro](https://wws-weblinc.netdna-\nssl.com/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTkvMTEvMTMvMTYvNDEvNTIvNzA1L1NMTUlDUk8uanBnIl0sWyJwIiwib3B0aW0iXV0/SLMICRO.jpg?sha=c331314a55df6453)\n](https://www.worldwidestereo.com/products/bose-soundlink-micro-bluetooth-\nwaterproof-speaker?color=Black) [ ![Bose SoundLink Micro](https://wws-\nweblinc.netdna-\nssl.com/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTkvMTEvMTMvMTYvNDEvNTIvNzA1L1NMTUlDUk8uanBnIl0sWyJwIiwib3B0aW0iXV0/SLMICRO.jpg?sha=c331314a55df6453)\n](https://www.worldwidestereo.com/products/bose-soundlink-micro-bluetooth-\nwaterproof-speaker?color=Black)\n\n### Why it won\n\nAt 10 ounces and a tiny 3.87 by 3.87 by 1.37 inches, the Bose Soundlink Micro\nreally is \u201cmicro.\u201d This little guy fits in the palm of your hand and wins our\nbest-sound-for-its-size prize, thanks to some brilliant engineering by Bose.\nInside, a full-range custom transducer and passive silicone radiators provide\nsurprisingly powerful sound. Close your eyes, and no \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t mistake it\nfor a quality bookshelf speaker \u2013 but you\u2019d never think you\u2019re listening to\nsomething smaller than a deck of cards.\n\nIncluded: a built-in microphone, Siri and Google Assistant, and a rubber strap\nfor attaching it to a bike or a purse... or pretty much anything. The\nSoundlink Micro comes in three colors and it\u2019s IPX7 certified, meaning it\u2019s\ntotally drop-it-in-bucket-of-water waterproof. No wonder reviews across the\nboard are overwhelmingly 5-star, ours included.\n\n **Dimensions:** 3.87x 3.87 x 1.37 in (W x H x D) | **Weight:** 0.64 lbs. |\n**Warranty:** 1 year | ******Battery Life:** Up to 6 Hours | ** ****\nWaterproof Rating: **IPX7 **** | **Stereo Pairing:** Yes  \n\n **Reg Price:** $109\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.worldwidestereo.com/products/bose-soundlink-micro-\nbluetooth-waterproof-speaker?color=Black)\n\n## #4\\.

The overall design is elegant in a less-is-more way and ideal for\nstowing in briefcases and purses. The overall sound, on the other hand, is\noutright superb. Harman Kardon got it done with ultra-thin speaker drivers\ntuned specifically for high fidelity sound. The Esquire Mini 2 delivers 10\nhours of playtime per charge and includes a noise-canceling conferencing\nsystem for crystal clear conference calls. You can choose from 5 colors. A\ncarrying pouch, kickstand, and Type C USB cable are included.\n\nClearly, Harman Kardon is targeting the traveling business person with the\nEsquire Mini 2, and on that, this smart little Bluetooth speaker is a home\nrun. To our ears, the Esquire Mini 2 sounds as good \u2013 or better \u2013 as many\nBluetooth speakers costing 2 or 3 times as much.\n\n **Dimensions:** 5.51 x 2.96 x 1.02 in (W x H x D) | **Weight:** 0.55 lbs. |\n**Warranty:** 1 year | ******Battery Life:** Up to 10 Hours **  \n**\n\n **Reg Price:** $149.95\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.worldwidestereo.com/products/harman-kardon-esquire-\nmini-2-ultra-slim-portable-premium-bluetooth-speaker)\n\n## #5\\.

Just don\u2019t let the\nsilly name throw you, as this speaker may just be the best on our list,\nperiod. It\u2019s a JBL, so it comes with JBL\u2019s signature sound \u2013 big awesome bass,\ncrystal clear highs, and overall extremely immersive. It weighs 35 pounds and\ncomes with a built-in 10,000mAh battery that nets 18 hours playtime per\ncharge, plus there\u2019s a 12V DC power source as well. Inside, 2 woofers, 3\ntweeters, and 120W RMS power. You can plug in a mic or guitar, and you can\ndaisy chain additional JBL PartyBox speakers wirelessly or via one RCA port to\nanother. And with TWS (true wireless stereo), you can use two PartyBox\nspeakers of the same model to enjoy true stereo. The light effects are vivid,\nnot gimmicky, available in three modes \u2013 and will put you in a trance in no\ntime.\n\nThe JBL PartyBox 300 is a fun, very serious music machine that brings a lot of\ngood things together. Yes, it\u2019s pricey, but it\u2019s JBL and it\u2019s awesome. And\nguess what? There\u2019s even a bigger version called the JBL Partybox 1000.\n[Really](https://www.worldwidestereo.com/products/jbl-partybox-1000-powerful-\nbluetooth-party-speaker-with-full-panel-light-effects-jblpartybox1000am).\n\n **Dimensions:** 12.59 x 12.20 x 27.16 in (W x H x D) | **Weight:** 34.92 lbs.\n| **Warranty:** 1 year | ******Battery Life:** Up to 18 Hours | **\n********Stereo Pairing:** Yes  \n\n **Reg Price:** $540\n\n[COMING SOON](https://www.worldwidestereo.com/products/jbl-\npartybox-300-portable-bluetooth-party-speaker-with-rechargeable-battery-\njblpartybox300)\n\n## #7\\.

The Bose S1 is a professional level Bluetooth speaker with enough\nmuscle to drown out the Macy\u2019s Day Parade at Times Square. (Hence the \u201cPA\u201d in\nthe name, as in \u201cpublic address system.\u201d) And yes, it\u2019s great for pro DJs and\npublic addresses, but it\u2019s also ideal for serious parties at home where you\nwant to cover a wider space with sound: weddings, big barbecues out back,\nkaraoke throwdowns, etc. The sound is amazing \u2013 so big it made us giddy \u2013 and\nthe feature set is all-encompassing. The speaker itself can be positioned to\npoint anywhere or mounted high on tripod speaker stands (not included) to\nreach those way, way in the back.\n\nThe Bose S1 provides 11 hours of playtime per charge, or just plug in the AC\npower cord. You can also plug in a keyboard, guitar, microphone or any 3.5mm\nsource through the S1\u2019s built-in 3 channel mixer. If you\u2019re on the fence about\ngoing big, the S1\u2019s full spec list on our Bose S1 product page may just win\nyou over.\n\n **Dimensions:** 9.5 x 13 x 11.2 in (W x H x D) | **Weight:** 15.7 lbs. |\n**Warranty:** 2 years | ******Battery Life:** Up to 11 Hours | **\n********Stereo Pairing:** Yes\n\n **Reg Price:** $599\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.worldwidestereo.com/products/bose-s1-professional-\nmulti-position-bluetooth-pa-system-with-battery-787930-1120)\n\n## #8\\.

This\none is easy, too, but it\u2019s more like set-it-and-stare-at-it. Really, it\u2019s hard\nto look away when the Pulse 4 hits the dance floor in a 360\u00b0 LED light show\nperfectly synced to the beat. The Pulse 4 is JBL\u2019s latest iteration of the\nPulse, which includes a better design (with more surface area for the light\nshow), a bigger, 12-hour battery, and an IPX7 waterproof rating. (The\nmicrophone and 3.5mm aux jack are gone.)\n\nThough you may be inclined to think anything with a \u201clight show\u201d has to be a\ngimmick, that\u2019s not the case \u2013 the Pulse 4 is still a JBL product and as such,\naudio quality is excellent. Not the best in the world, no, but a solid\ncompetitor at this price point. Bass is above average, and the Pulse 4 was\ndesigned to throw sound in 360-degrees. It\u2019s louder than most, too, but sound\nquality drops off a bit at higher volume.\n\nWhat else? How about the ability to pair with up to 100 JBL speakers via JBL\nConnect? Now that\u2019s cool. (Watching a bunch of Pulse 4s all doing their own\nthing to the beat just makes you want to party.

With both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth onboard,\nthe Sonos Move is extremely versatile, and can be used as a stand-alone\nspeaker you can take anywhere, inside or out, or add it to an existing\nnetworked speaker system. Either way, the Move gets it right.\n\nLike everything Sonos, the Move is \u201cApple-esque.\u201d It\u2019s attractive, solid (even\nheavy for its size), smart and intuitive. The Move sits neatly in its charging\nbase or can be charged via USB. Music lovers will love that you can create\ntrue stereo with a pair of Moves and/or add the Move to your existing Sonos\nnetwork. With AirPlay, you can stream pretty much everything, whether via\nYoutube, Netflix, HBO GO or any playlist from any smart phone or tablet.\nWhat\u2019s more, the Move is bi-lingual, so simple voice commands get everything\ndone with Amazon\u2019s Alexa.\n\nWho knows why it took Sonos so long to enter the bluetooth speaker market, but\nthe Move\u2019s sound is pure Sonos \u2013 rich, vibrant, remarkable clarity \u2013 and sure\nto be yet another Sonos best-seller in spite of its higher price tag.\n\nWhat else?

We did just that with the Bose\nPortable speaker, a smart speaker Bose claims is \u201cbest at bass,\u201d and yeah \u2013\nwe\u2019re believers. At this price point, Bose crushes the competition when it\ncomes to powerful bass in a portable package.  \n\nThe Bose Portable speaker is an Amazon Alexa / Googe Assistant smart speaker\nfrom a company that continues to out-innovate everyone save for maybe Sonos.\n(Depends on who you ask.) It streams whatever you like via at-home Wi-Fi or\ngo-anywhere Bluetooth, and it proved excellent at hearing and executing voice\ncommands \u2013 though voice commands only work when connected by WiFi, not\nBluetooth. As for sound: it\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve come to expect from Bose:\npowerful, and remarkably crisp and clear.  \n\nWith the nifty little handle on top, the Bose Portable doesn\u2019t exactly hide\nits rugged portable-ness. All the controls are on top, and it comes with a\nUSB-C cord for charging the battery, though Bose also offers a charging cradle\nin the $30 range. Add the cradle, and the Bose Portable begins to approach the\nSonos Move with respect to price. Tough choice, for sure.  \n\n **Dimensions:** 4.69 x 7.54 x 4.09 in (W x H x D) | **Weight:** 2.34 lbs. |\n**Warranty:** 1 year | ******Battery Life:** Up to 12 Hours | **Waterproof\nRating:** IPX4\n\n **Reg Price:** $349.00  \n\n[COMING SOON](https://www.worldwidestereo.com/products/bose-portable-home-\nspeaker-triple-black)\n\n## #11\\.

Meticulously woven with woolen threads, designed\nby leading Danish textile designer Kvadrat, and called, all irony aside,\n\u201cHelsinki,\u201d it comes by way of Vifa \u2013 loudspeaker specialists since 1933.  \n\nUnder its outer fabric, the Helsinki\u2019s one-piece aluminum frame holds\neverything in place. Everything includes: Two 50 mm speaker drivers with\naluminum cones and neodymium magnets, two 60mm woofers placed back to back,\nand a digital amp with a DSP crossover to limit distortion. There\u2019s also a\n3.5mm mini jack (thank you), and a smart-looking leather strap by Swedish\nleather manufacturer Tarnsjo Garveri. So yeah, la-dee-dah for sure.\n\nAnd the sound? Surprisingly powerful, given its clutch-bag look and packaging.\nMid-range is decent, lows hold their own, and highs cut thru nicely. No, the\nHelsinki is not as feature-rich as other, similarly-priced speakers, but still\n\u2013 look at it.
