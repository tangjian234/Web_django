With an incredible 13 hours of battery life and\na 100-foot wireless range, It can keep the music going all night and into the\nmorning. What stands out about this bluetooth speaker is the incredible bass\nand tone for such a small speaker. A really nice feature is that the [UE\nWonderboom 2](https://amzn.to/2KU403e) is waterproof. Not water-resistant, but\nwaterproof, making it an excellent choice for the beach or boat.\n\nAmazingly, this speaker comes in at a purchase price of around $80. For the\nmoney, and the quality you are getting, it\u2019s hard to match this speaker. The\nfolks at [Ultimate Ears](https://amzn.to/2KU403e) have a great line of\nspeakers in general, and every model they have out could have wound up on this\nlist.\n\n![Jamie R.](https://i1.wp.com/realreviews.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/jamie-r-ue-wonderboom-2.jpg?fit=50%2C52&ssl=1)\n\nJamie R.\n\n __Read More\n\nI love the UE Wonderboom 2, I take it everywhere with me and at my last\ncompany party, we had a BLAST because of it.

It comes in\nat a little over 2 pounds and has a wireless range of only 30 feet. Like the\nWonderboom the [Charge 4](https://amzn.to/35zW8Mh) is also waterproof. The\n[Charge 4](https://amzn.to/35zW8Mh) is not only our favorite Bluetooth speaker\nat [RealReviews.org](https://realreviews.org/), but it\u2019s also a crowd favorite\nwith the consumers on Amazon.\n\nWhat the [Charge 4](https://amzn.to/35zW8Mh) does well is to provide\noutstanding sound quality. It is loud, well-balanced, and full of bass. The\ntwo drivers and two passive radiators allow for a genuinely remarkable tone.\nAlso, the [Charge 4](https://amzn.to/35zW8Mh) has a battery that just won\u2019t\nquit. Boasting over 20 hours of battery life, and even the ability to charge\nyour phone when it\u2019s dead. Lastly, the [Charge 4](https://amzn.to/35zW8Mh)\nalso comes with an AUX input so that you can play audio out of it from almost\nevery format imaginable.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect, of course. It\u2019s more expensive than some of the other\nspeakers coming in at around $170, so you are paying for that extra sound.\nAlso, it\u2019s larger and heavier than some of the othee bluetooth speakers we\ntested, but its certainly still portable.\n\n![Roxanne W.](https://i1.wp.com/realreviews.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/roxanne-w-jbl-charge.jpg?fit=50%2C50&ssl=1)\n\nRoxanne W.\n\n __Read More\n\nI've taken this to EVERY PARTY AND LOVE IT!!

With prices somewhere\naround 30 dollars, this little speaker is surprisingly great for such a small\nprice.  \nNow, if you have the extra 40 bucks or so to spend, I would still tell you to\ngo with the UE Wonderboom, but this little guy from the people at\n[Tribit](https://amzn.to/2KWLiIk) is truly impressive with its remarkably low\nprice point. The speaker\u2019s sound is just way better than anyone would expect\nfor such an affordable product. [Tribit](https://amzn.to/2KWLiIk) cut some\ncost corners with design, but who cares how the speaker looks? It\u2019s about the\nsound, and the sound is simply way better than it should be. It comes in at\nunder a pound like it\u2019s counterpart above, has an amazing battery life, and is\nwater-resistant!\n\n[The Tribit](https://amzn.to/2KWLiIk), Like the Wonderboom, has no AUX input\nand no speakerphone as well (no surprise for the affordable price) If you want\nan affordable, reliable speaker with excellent sound quality, this is it. It\nwon\u2019t tear the roof of the house, and it definitely won\u2019t be the speaker to\nbring the party to its feet, but use it next to the pool or lounging at the\nbeach, and this speaker does everything you would expect and more.\n\n![Thomas C.](https://i2.wp.com/realreviews.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/thomas-c-tribit-review.jpg?fit=50%2C51&ssl=1)\n\nThomas C.\n\n __Read More\n\nI love the TriBit bluetooth speaker.

And the money it will cost you. Coming in at\naround a whopping $400, the [Sonos ](https://amzn.to/2KXMfAb)is hand-down the\nmost expensive on this list. That being said, the people at Sonos deliver with\nwhat can only be described as the future of Bluetooth sound.\n\nThe speaker is big! [Sonos Move](https://amzn.to/2KXMfAb) weighs over six and\na half pounds. And it only boasts around 10-hours of battery life. So it\u2019s\nbig, expensive, and doesn\u2019t last half as long as the JBL? Why should you get\nit? Quite simply, it\u2019s the best sounding speaker that you have probably ever\nheard. With one down-firing tweeter, one mid-woofer, and two Class-D digital\namplifiers, it sounds like you are at the concert itself. The connectivity is\ntremendous as well, with Wi-Fi up to 5GHz and Bluetooth 4.2. It is also water-\nresistant at an IP56 rating.\n\nSure it might be a lot to take to the beach or on a hike, but if you are\nheading from your kitchen to the pool, this could be your solution for your\nindoor/outdoor sound. [Sonos](https://amzn.to/2KXMfAb) also works incredibly\nhard on making all their products work seamlessly together. They are\nconstantly updating their apps and software to ensure the best possible\nquality usage of their products for whatever your need is.\n\n![Olivia L.](https://i2.wp.com/realreviews.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/OLIVIA-l-sonos-bluetooth-\nspeaker.jpg?fit=50%2C48&ssl=1)\n\nOlivia L.\n\n __Read More\n\nThe Sonos Move is exactly what I need when I do yoga in the mornings, or want\nto listen to music while i'm gardening.

The\nbiggest factor to look at is what you want to use your speaker for? If you\njust want to have something a deck for possible usage, or if you are an\naudiophile who is tired of living behind their headphones and wants to share\nmusic with friends and family. The Bluetooth Speaker market continues to\nimpress with a wide range of products for any situation.\n\n## Related Reviews\n\n![iPhone 11](https://i0.wp.com/realreviews.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/iPhone-11.png?fit=756%2C756&ssl=1)\n\n## iPhone 11 Reviews\n\nClick below to read a review of the **iPhone 11.**\n\n[ Click Here to Read Now ](https://realreviews.org/real-reviews-of-the-\niphone-11/)\n\n## Recommended\n\n![Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptops](https://i1.wp.com/realreviews.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Aspire-5-Slim-Laptop.jpg?fit=579%2C579&ssl=1)\n\n## Up Next: The Best Laptops Under $600\n\nClick below to read a review of the **best laptops under $600**\n\n[ Click Here to Read Now ](https://realreviews.org/real-reviews-of-the-best-\nlaptops-under-600/)\n\n### Submit Your Review\n\nSimply fill out the form to submit your review.
