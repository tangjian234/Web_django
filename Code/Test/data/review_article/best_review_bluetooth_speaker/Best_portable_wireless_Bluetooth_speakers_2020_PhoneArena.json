They range wildly in sizes, shapes,\ncolors and prices. With batteries that last many hours they're great to bring\non a camping trip or just to enjoy some music in your back yard. The market is\nflooded with hundreds of models so picking one can overwhelming. That's why\nwe've selected the best portable Bluetooth speakers available right now and\nseparated them into three price categories. We have tiny speakers, small\nspeakers and even ones that can barely be called portable,\n\n  \n\nSo, which Bluetooth speaker should you buy if you had to shop today? Let's\ntake a look at the pros and cons for each one of them right below.\n\n  \n\n## The best wireless Bluetooth speakers, a summarized list:\n\n### Bluetooth speakers for $100 or less:\n\n  * JBL Clip 3\n  * UE Wonderboom 2\n  * Bose Soundlink Micro\n  * Tribit XSound Go\n  * Anker Soundcore Flare 2\n\n### Bluetooth speakers from $100 to $200:\n\n  * [UE Boom 3](https://www.phonearena.com/cp/lsfarea.html#boom3)\n  * JBL Flip 5\n  * Beats Pill+\n  * Bose SoundLink Mini 2\n  * [UE Megaboom](https://www.phonearena.com/cp/lsfarea.html#megaboom)\n  * Anker Soundcore Trance\n  * Braven BRV-XL\n\n### Bluetooth speakers for over $200:\n\n  * Marshall Kilburn 2\n  * JBL Boombox 2\n  * Sonos Move\n  * DiamondBoxx PA15\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Bluetooth speakers for $100 or less\n\n  \n\n### JBL Clip 3\n\n  \n\n[![Best portable wireless Bluetooth speakers\n\\(2020\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/358573-image/jbl-\nclip-3.jpg)\n\nBattery life: Up to 10 hours\n\n  \n\nThe JBL Clip 3 is part of the ultra-portable Bluetooth speakers segment. It's\nnot powerful enough for a party at home, but you'll often see it hanging from\nthe backpack of someone rollerblading or snowboarding. Its IPX7 waterproof,\nsmall, and has a built-in carabiner, making it the perfect companion for\noutdoor activities.\n\n  \n\nDespite the compact body, this is still a JBL speaker, so expect to be\npleasantly surprised when you hear it for the first time.\n\n  \n\n[Buy JBL Clip 3 from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2xAHycc)\n\n[](https://amzn.to/2xWyUo7)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n### UE Wonderboom 2\n\n  \n\n[![Best portable wireless Bluetooth speakers\n\\(2020\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/353526-image/UE-\nWonderboom-2.jpg)\n\nBattery life: Up to 13 hours\n\n  \n\nMaybe more than anything, the Wonderboom 2 succeeds because of how reliable it\nis. It can survive a drop up to five feet, will safely float rather than sink\nto the bottom of a pool, and features like its multi-speaker mode are always\neasily accessible, without forcing users to download an extra app: you just\ntake it with you, and the music follows. Plus, it just looks cute!\n\n  \n\n[Buy UE Wonderboom 2 from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2YvgzJZ)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Bose SoundLink Micro\n\n  \n\n[![Best portable wireless Bluetooth speakers\n\\(2020\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/358574-image/bose-\nsoundlink-micro.jpg)\n\nBattery life: Up to 6 hours\n\n  \n\nBose joins the small Bluetooth speaker fray with its SoundLink Micro. It also\ncomes with an IPX7 rating for water resistance and is light enough to be\nclipped almost anywhere. Compared to the previous two speakers, however, the\nbattery life is a bit short and won't get you through a full day of hiking.\nStill, it's a good choice for a compact Bluetooth speaker from a reputable\nbrand.\n\n  \n\n[Buy Bose Soundlink Micro from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3fcnuhj)\n\n[](https://amzn.to/2xfYEMj)\n\n  \n\n### Tribit XSound Go\n\n  \n\n[![Best portable wireless Bluetooth speakers\n\\(2020\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/353529-image/DOSS-\ntouch.jpg)\n\nBattery life: Up to 24 hours\n\n  \n\nThe Tribit XSound Go is undoubtedly inspired by the Beats Pill, but it comes\nat a much lower price, making it very enticing. It's specs aren't shabby at\nall, however! Two 6W drivers, waterproof just like the rest so far and a full\nday of battery life if you're not cranking up the volume too much. But you\nmight want to do that since the XSound Go is managing to keep its sound\ndistortion-free even at higher volume levels. If you're looking for the\nultimate value Bluetooth speaker, the Tribit XSound Go is hard to beat.\n\n  \n\n[Buy Tribit XSound Go from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2z6NpGE)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n###\n\n### Anker Soundcore Flare 2\n\n  \n\n[![Best portable wireless Bluetooth speakers\n\\(2020\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/358575-image/anker-\nsoundcore-flare-2.jpg)\n\nBattery life: Up to 12 hours\n\n  \n\nTime for something affordable that can provide a bit more powerful sound.\nUnlike the mini speakers, this one is designed with home parties in mind. It\nprovides a 360-degrees sound, has improved bass capabilities and even some\nlight effects at the base. You can pair tens of Flare 2 speakers to create an\nall-encompassing audio experience. The battery life is on the shorter side\nwhen it comes to Bluetooth speakers of that size, but it will get you through\nthe night no problem.\n\n  \n\n[Buy Anker Soundcore Flare 2 from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2YwvvaY)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Bluetooth speakers from $100 to $200\n\n  \n\n### UE Boom 3\n\n  \n\n[![Best portable wireless Bluetooth speakers\n\\(2020\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/353539-image/UE-\nBoom-3.jpg)\n\nBattery life: Up to 15 hours\n\n  \n\nThe UE Boom 3 is another great option that is waterproof and shockproof. UE\nputs its speakers through rigorous testing you you can take it anywhere\nwithout much worry. While earlier, UE Boom speakers had support for Amazon's\nAlexa voice assistant, it has now been revoked and this is just a regular\nspeaker focused on great sound quality, but without smart assistance commands.\nIn terms of sound quality, the UE Boom 3 is also excellent with crisp highs\nand mids, and an overall surprisingly powerful sound for its size.\n\n  \n\n[Buy UE Boom 3 from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3fir5KJ)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n### JBL Flip 5\n\n  \n\n[![Best portable wireless Bluetooth speakers\n\\(2020\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/354058-image/P1520469.jpg)\n\nBattery life: Up to 12 hours\n\n  \n\nThe JBL Flip 5 is where great sound quality, cool design and great price meet.\nIt's the kind of speaker you'd be proud to whip out of your backpack and play\nsome music for your friends. Unlike most other speakers, the Flip 5 comes with\na Type C charging port which means you don't need to carry an extra cable and\ncan use your phone's charger (unless it's an iPhone, of course). It's also\njust as durable as the best of them. Battery life is okay but not among the\nbest and and unlike the Flip 4 (which is also a good, slightly cheaper option)\nit can't be used for calls.  \n\n  \n\n[Buy JBL Flip 5 from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3dc7Y34)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n###\n\n### Beats Pill+\n\n  \n\n[![Best portable wireless Bluetooth speakers\n\\(2020\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/354059-image/P1520470.jpg)\n\nBattery life: Up to 12 hours\n\n  \n\nNow here's something for the iPhone users of the world. Of course, the Beats\nPill+ can be paired with Android phones as well, but it charges through a\nLightning cable which makes it a lot more convenient for those part of the\nApple ecosystem. The Pill+ packs a punch despite what its design might\nsuggest. The sound is loud and clear and there's even a decent amount of bass\nto go with it. Best of all, you don't have to pay a hefty premium for this\nBeats product, the price of the Pill+ is in line with other products from its\nclass.\n\n  \n\n[Buy Beats Pill+ from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2KX47Ll)\n\n  \n\n### Bose SoundLink Mini II\n\n  \n\n[![Best portable wireless Bluetooth speakers\n\\(2020\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/353542-image/bose-\nsoundlink-2.jpg)\n\nBattery life: Up to 12 hours\n\n  \n\nThe Bose SoundLink Mini 2 might have the most outdated look of them all, but\nit has absolutely stellar sound quality that beats the JBL Charge 3 and UE\nBoom 3 by a long shot. It has a more open sound stage, with much better\ndefined sound in both highs and lows, and it has sufficient volume to fill a\nroom nicely. It sounds exquisite, especially considering its rather small\nsize. Unfortunately, it's not the best partner for your outdoor activities as\nit's lacking an IP rating.\n\n  \n\n[Buy Bose SoundLink Mini II from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/35woVm0)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n### UE Megaboom 3\n\n  \n\n[![Best portable wireless Bluetooth speakers\n\\(2020\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/353557-image/UE-\nMegaboom-3.jpg)\n\nBattery life: Up to 20 hours\n\n  \n\nThe UE Megaboom 3 is probably the most popular large Bluetooth speakers out\nthere and for a good reason: it blasts powerful 360-degree sound, allows\npairing two speakers to get even more boom and has a rock solid connection\nthat it can keep at distances of up to 150 feet. If the regular Boom 3 isn't\ngood enough for your purposes then the Megaboom 3 will surely be able to\ndeliver.\n\n  \n\n[Buy UE Megaboom 3 from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3dkJTr3)\n\n  \n\n### Anker Soundcore Trance\n\n  \n\n![Best portable wireless Bluetooth speakers\n\\(2020\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\n\nBattery life: Up to 18 hours\n\n  \n\nThe Soundcore Trance Bluetooth speaker is great for both house parties and\noutdoor ones, due to its huge 101dB sound, waterproof design and beat-driven\nLED lights. You can even use the Soundcore app to play party games involving\nthe speaker, boost the bass, and more.\n\n  \n\n[Buy Anker Soundcore Trance on Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3iWTlEy)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n### Braven BRV-XL\n\n  \n\n![Best portable wireless Bluetooth speakers\n\\(2020\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\n\nBattery life: Up to 16 hours\n\n  \n\nThis Bluetooth speaker from Braven offers up to 16 hours of powerful (40W)\nmusic, and can also serve as a power bank for your phone at the same time. The\nBraven BRV-XL is rugged and waterproof, it even floats, so it's great for both\npool parties and camping trips. It has a convenient built-in handle, along\nwith an optional shoulder strap. As a hidden party bonus, this speaker even\ncomes with a built-in bottle opener.\n\n  \n\n[Buy Braven BRV-XL on Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3fsejZU)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Bluetooth speakers over $200\n\n  \n\n### Marshall Kilburn II\n\n  \n\n[![Best portable wireless Bluetooth speakers\n\\(2020\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/353558-image/marshall-\nkilburn-2.jpg)\n\nBattery life: 20+ hours\n\n  \n\nThe stylish-looking Marshall Kilburn will look great in any home with the\nrecognizable Marshall design. But it's not just about the visual appeal as it\nalso boasts a very clear and loud sound output that will definitely have music\nenthusiasts happy. And while it's bigger and heavier than most other speakers\non the list, it does have a strap to carry it around so you can take your\npremium music experience anywhere and enjoy it for more than 20 hours. The\nprice tag is a step above what we've looked at so far, but if it's within your\nbudget, you won't regret getting the Kilburn II.\n\n  \n\n[Buy Marshall Kilburn II from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2KUs9Xj)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n### JBL Boombox 2\n\n  \n\n[![Best portable wireless Bluetooth speakers\n\\(2020\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/354060-image/P1520489.jpg)\n\nBattery life: Up to 24 hours\n\n  \n\nWith a boomy bass and an overall impressive sound quality, the large-sized JBL\nBoombox 2 is one more great big Bluetooth speaker. All speakers on this list\ncan be used for an outdoor party but the Boombox 2 is probably the only one\nthat can do it without any compromises. To top it off, you can also use this\nspeaker's 10,000mAh battery as a power bank to charge up your phone.\n\n  \n\n[Buy JBL Boombox 2 from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2CuOVEd)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n### Sonos Move\n\n  \n\n[![Best portable wireless Bluetooth speakers\n\\(2020\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/358590-image/sonos-\nmove.jpg)\n\nBattery life: Up to 10 hours\n\n  \n\nThe Sonos Move will fill your room or even garden with loud and balanced sound\nthat will impress your guests.
