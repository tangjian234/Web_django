They also often aren't\nportable or waterproofed for the great outdoors. In (mostly) forgoing smarts,\nBluetooth speakers are nearly always more versatile, more rugged, and more\nportable\u2014and they'll work with anybody's smartphone. They also sound as good\nor better than many of their smart-speaker equivalents.\n\nIn the past year, we've tested more than 35 different Bluetooth speakers and\nresearched dozens more online, and we can happily say they are still some of\nthe best small devices you can listen to. Here are our favorites right now.\n\nBe sure to check out all our [buying guides](https://www.wired.com/tag/buying-\nguides/), including the [Best Soundbars](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-\nsoundbars/) and [Best Smart Speakers](https://www.wired.com/story/best-smart-\nspeakers/) guides.\n\n _Updated for February 2020: We've updated links and pricing, gave a bigger\nhonorable mention to the Oontz Angle 3, and have removed the Riva Concert._\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.\n[Learn more](https://www.wired.com/2015/11/affiliate-link-policy/).\n\n  * ![smart speakers](https://media.wired.com/photos/5b91bae4957bd64b93788268/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/BOOM.jpg)\n\nPhotograph: Ultimate Ears\n\n## Best Overall\n\nUE Boom 3\n\nThere are bigger and badder Bluetooth speakers, but none match the fun and\nconvenience of the Ultimate Ears Boom 3 ([9/10, WIRED\nRecommends](https://www.wired.com/review/ultimate-ears-boom-3-megaboom-3/)).\nIt puts out some of the most pleasant, balanced sound for its size. The\nwaterproof cylinder comes in multiple colors, it can last 15 hours between\ncharges, and it gives you 100 feet of Bluetooth range. On top of all that, it\nhas a two-year warranty. If you really need to get a party kicking, the\n[Megaboom 3 is a beefier model](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Ears-MEGABOOM-\nBluetooth-Waterproof/dp/B07DD3W154/) that amps up the bass.\n\n[$140 at\nAmazon](https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxiCzBr3qCy57SPX2rCSRUVqEzqfCwTXn9EMiYWshntHQdMARkbxHeFk3kVm575owLb?cid=5b103e5652d92f2e003123ef)\n\n[$150 at Best\nBuy](https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxiCzBr3qCy57SPX2rCSRUVqEzqfCwTXn9EMjy2TPpEpZTLCAgr1LQRMh7MV6eU66uJ?cid=5b103e5652d92f2e003123ef)\n\n[$150 at\nWalmart](https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxiCzBr3qCy57SPX2rCSRUVqEzqfCwTXn9EMjy2TPpEpZTLCAgr1LQRMh7MV6eU66uK?cid=5b103e5652d92f2e003123ef)\n\n  * ![tribit maxsound plus speaker in black](https://media.wired.com/photos/5d97780e647bad0008249386/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/Gear-Tribit-MaxSound-Plus-SORUCE-Tribit.jpg)\n\nPhotograph: Tribit\n\n## Best Bargain\n\nTribit MaxSound Plus\n\nTribit may be a brand you haven't heard of, but its line of Bluetooth speakers\nsound a lot better than they should for the price. The [MaxSound Plus\n($56)](https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-MaxSound-Bluetooth-Exceptional-\nWaterproof/dp/B07MQWG3PR/) is my favorite model. It has dual forward-firing\ndrivers and passive radiators in an 8-inch-long pill shape. No, it can't fuel\na trance dance party on its own, but its sound clarity really impressed me,\nand it has a fun extra bass button that adds some surprising thump. The extra\nbass is a little muddy, and sure, it looks a lot like a [Beats\nPill+](https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Pill-Portable-Speaker-\nBlack/dp/B016QXV2QK/), but it's still fun.\n\nWith 15\u201320 hours of battery and an IPX7 waterproof rating (not dust-proof, but\nI immersed it in water and it's fine), it's a great companion for some\nbackyard tunes, a trip down the river, or a ton of other informal gatherings.\nIf you don't need the extra bass and want an even tinier 7-inch speaker, the\n[XSound Go ($33)](https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-XSound-Bluetooth-Speakers-\nBuilt/dp/B07594HZ6Y/) is similar and also puts out clean audio for its size.\n\n[$56 at\nAmazon](https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxnUGQGAQE2uDU3SeMgb5UfVQZNnd6Wn4gNg9SWDUjEQWxt5qWYbFZqN9n9riScn8DQ?cid=5b103e5652d92f2e003123ef)\n\n  * ![Sonos move speaker ](https://media.wired.com/photos/5d81694416adef000889c9eb/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/Gear-Sonos_Move_Green-FA.jpg)\n\nPhotograph: Sonos\n\n## Best for Home\n\nSonos Move\n\nIf you want a Bluetooth speaker that can fill any room (or patio) but lives a\nlot of its life inside, the Sonos Move ([8/10, WIRED\nRecommends](https://www.wired.com/review/sonos-move/)) is a good speaker to\nbuild a home network around. [Sonos invented wireless multiroom\nspeakers](https://www.wired.com/story/sonos-nick-millington-exclusive-\ninterview/). Its speakers connect to nearly every streaming service, and they\nwork with Google Assistant or Alexa. They also sound amazing by every measure.\nJust know that the Move is primarily a wireless speaker that streams over your\nWi-Fi network, but it also functions as a Bluetooth speaker when you take it\noutside, or anywhere away from Wi-Fi.\n\nIt comes with a wireless charging cradle for when it's in the kitchen, and\nit's splash-resistant\u2014I shot a hose at it, so it can get wet\u2014for when it's by\nthe pool.\n\n[$399 at\nAmazon](https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxnTn1RVrRvYESaVByPhLY51v2eTDAxmmjbP3H6iTiVpsUqytnJL4t6YUu4JUjbwkYL?cid=5b103e5652d92f2e003123ef)\n\n  * \n\n  * ![wonderboom speaker in blue and teal](https://media.wired.com/photos/5d97778228aa88000843485d/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/Gear-UE-Wonderboom-2-SOURCE-Ultimate-Ears.jpg)\n\nPhotograph: Ultimate Ears\n\n## Best for Pool Parties\n\nUE Wonderboom 2\n\nThe Ultimate Ears Wonderboom was a [WIRED Gear of the Year award\nwinner](https://www.wired.com/story/gear-of-the-year-2017/), and that's\nbecause it's the best pool companion you can have, and the new Wonderboom 2 is\njust a little better. The 4-inch(-ish) little ball of joy now sports IP67\nwater and dust resistance. It gets 13 hours of battery (three more than\nbefore), has a 100-foot Bluetooth range, floats, and pumps out surprisingly\npotent audio while doing it. UE says it's \"drop-proof\" up to 5 feet, but you\ncan honestly play some light catch with it on the lawn and it won't be any\nworse for wear. Just wash it off when you're done! You can even pair two\ntogether for proper stereo sound.\n\n[$96 at\nAmazon](https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxnUGKF7bR2EQa1iwnZaQEkpubB2AKe1pZCUgUhAi691dv5AjuPKtwYBDoYrNKi7Paf?cid=5b103e5652d92f2e003123ef)\n\n  * ![marshall stockwell speaker with strap](https://media.wired.com/photos/5d977850a351410008cb5a75/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/Gear-Marshall-Stockwell-2-SOURCE-Marshall.jpg)\n\nPhotograph: Marshall\n\n## Best for Rocking Out\n\nMarshall Stockwell II\n\nIf you're a music fan, or just love the classic Marshall guitar amplifier\ndesign, this Bluetooth speaker is ready to rock. Like all Marshall products,\nyou pay a price for the style, but it does live up to expectations. For a\nspeaker that's about as big as four DVD cases stacked, standing upright, it\nsounds killer with a smooth, balanced, and refined sound.\n\nThe exterior has a durable-feeling, splash-resistant silicone finish, and the\nfront and back are covered with a steel grille. It has a front-facing woofer\nand a tweeter on each side, powered by a battery that lasts around 20 hours\n(USB-C charging with a 3.5-mm jack too), depending on how much you tweak the\nstylish volume, treble, and bass knobs up top. The battery indicator is also\nhandy. I've enjoyed toting all 3 pounds of it around with its carry strap,\nwhich has a leather feel on the outside and a red velvet look and feel on the\ninside.\n\nIf you want a little more power and heft, the [Marshall Kilburn II\n($220)](https://www.amazon.com/Marshall-Kilburn-Portable-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker/dp/B07H7CZ6BZ/) is similarly excellent.\n\n[$188 at\nAmazon](https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxnUGQGSLdqq5AxhAJmFRYKCvuTeua31VJaTNSYdepnjjW2ZAwyaowGXfatDwijBdSm?cid=5b103e5652d92f2e003123ef)\n\n  * ![JBL Link 20 speaker](https://media.wired.com/photos/5b117e5d44c29b1bf25f2378/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/JBL-Link-20-SOURCE-JBL.jpg)\n\nPhotograph: JBL\n\n## The Google Whisperer\n\nJBL Link 20\n\nThe JBL Link 20 ([8/10, WIRED Recommends](https://www.wired.com/review/review-\njbl-link-speakers-with-google-assistant/)) is the [best portable smart\nspeaker](https://www.wired.com/story/best-smart-speakers/) you're gonna find,\nand probably the most feature-rich speaker on this entire list outside the\nSonos Move.\n\nIt can connect via Bluetooth, but it also has Wi-Fi with Google Assistant\nbuilt-in, so you can yell \"Hey Google\" and get some answers. It's easy to use\nand has helpful indicators so you know if it has a solid connection and when\nit's running out of juice. Did I mention it's waterproof, floats, and gets 10\nhours per charge? Not too shabby.\n\n[$150 at B&H\nAudio](https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxi9boqU6Ze6wyezjQYuALTbUb6uQ8b1eiE2UHARzB16ReNymNirbZheDEA76rVLdjx?cid=5b103e5652d92f2e003123ef)\n\n  * ![This image may contain Cylinder and Bottle](https://media.wired.com/photos/5a1c8a14da3ec353252a7c89/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/megablast-TA.jpg)\n\nPhotograph: Ultimate Ears\n\n## Alexa Inside\n\nUE Megablast\n\nWe like Google Assistant more than Amazon's Alexa, but if you're looking for a\ngreat-sounding Bluetooth speaker with full Alexa integration, reach for this\ntallboy. The UE Megablast ([8/10, WIRED\nRecommends](https://www.wired.com/review/review-ultimate-ears-blast-\nmegablast/)) is about the size of a 24-oz can o' your favorite beverage. Think\nof it like a larger, better sounding, and smarter Boom 2.\n\nThe Megablast also made our list of [Best Alexa\nSpeakers](https://www.wired.com/story/best-amazon-echo/).

It's waterproof and has a little carabiner\nup top so you can snap it to all kinds of stuff. It also has more controls on\nit (volume, play, Bluetooth, power) than other micro-sized speakers. The\nkicker is a built-in, retractable 3.5-mm audio cable, giving you an easy way\nto plug in for some quick tunes without fussing with Bluetooth.\n\nDon't need the 3.5-mm cable? The newer [JBL Clip 3 sounds slightly\nbetter](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Portable-Waterproof-Wireless-\nBluetooth/dp/B07CVRZYF3/), but it doesn't have the 3.5-mm cable built in, and\nits carabiner doesn't bend up and down.\n\n[$49 at\nAmazon](https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxi9boqWdsrS8itFuuCMnsyd8dTRq2SCXsGD6HTvJyvuG7xXFoUrKfuAbrXHZFmSUuv?cid=5b103e5652d92f2e003123ef)\n\n  * ![Bose speaker](https://media.wired.com/photos/5b117ee7bc638c7149b94bd5/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/Bose-SoundLink-Micro-SOURCE-Bose.jpg)\n\nPhotograph: Bose\n\n## Bike Lock\n\nBose Soundlink Micro\n\nThe Bose SoundLink Micro is about the same size as the Clip 2 and has a\nstretchy silicone strap on the back that's taut enough that it'll stick to\nbike handlebars or a backpack strap when you're on the move. Thanks to an\nextra passive radiator next to the main driver, it sounds way better than\nother tiny speakers and even pumps out some legitimate bass\u2014all while\nmaintaining a rugged, waterproof design and 6 hours of battery life.\n\n[$79 at\nAmazon](https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxi9boqWhVyawQiHhPhsQmuUgUYNoeYqA69gJjWw55eBGX4Aq6jAaht4UMn7CzRGUFu?cid=5b103e5652d92f2e003123ef)\n\n  * ![Anker speaker](https://media.wired.com/photos/5b117bfd5db69615da05cdab/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/Anker-Soundcore-Flare-SOURCE-Anker.jpg)\n\nPhotograph: Anker\n\n## Light Bright\n\nAnker Soundcore Flare\n\nAnker is known for affordable accessories that actually work, and the\nSoundcore Flare is the perfect example. It's a very capable soda-can-sized\nwaterproof Bluetooth speaker with a beat-driven LED light ring and 12 hours of\nbattery life. It even has dual drivers and passive radiators for 360-degree\nsound, and an app with some equalizer settings.

It looks odd,\nbut the beat-driven party lights are a blast if you're in the mood. It's also\nsplash-proof and puts out fantastic forward-firing sound with a decent kick of\nbass, thanks to some tuning by Meridian Audio.

Break-dancers from the past would have killed for a speaker that\nwas completely waterproof and had 24 hours of battery life. The Boombox can\nalso connect to multiple smartphones at a time, so you don't have to DJ by\nyour lonesome. With a 20,000-mAh battery onboard, it can also charge your\ngadgets for days.\n\n(Note: The price fluctuates on this one.

The Envaya's volume doesn't get extraordinarily loud, but it doesn't\ndistort. The audio clarity and range bring a playlist to life more than any\nbargain speaker I've heard, thanks to an onboard amplifier.\n\nEvery model is IP67 waterproof, can pair with another Envaya speaker, and gets\nbetween 10 and 12 hours on a charge. The rubber edges have also withstood a\ncouple of tumbles already. My only complaint is the lack of a Play/Pause\nbutton, though the mic and ability to take calls almost makes up for it.\n\n[$99 at\nAmazon](https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxkgiqCRhyTpvxZryTVgbrYCy93k4EogXnrLGvRiUgR8iTTq7VAoyhT3GiEsZpDLB46?cid=5b103e5652d92f2e003123ef)\n\n  * ![Bose speaker](https://media.wired.com/photos/5b117f204d07335caef49579/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/Bose-SoundLink-Revolve%2B-White-SOURCE-Bose.jpg)\n\nPhotograph: Bose\n\n## I Just Really Like This One\n\nBose SoundLink Revolve+\n\nIt's not the cheapest, cutest, or most waterproof, but the Bose Revolve+ makes\nme smile.

I'm beginning to think so.\n\n[$239 at\nAmazon](https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxi9bosBCmSRvfLhi952fwjmXaDFMH5aHohNDBJKrpC7AFVMcKsKtc8tnSiCxgNBKV5?cid=5b103e5652d92f2e003123ef)\n\n  * ![Image may contain Electronics Camera and Electrical Device](https://media.wired.com/photos/5e38bacccb169d00086fdbf5/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/Gear-DemerBox-DB2-SOURCE-DemerBox.jpg)\n\nPhotograph: DemerBox\n\n## Adventure Companion\n\nDemerBox DB2\n\nThe DemerBox DB2 is a perfect companion to your boldest outdoor adventures, in\nlarge part because it serves two purposes: It's a loud portable speaker with\n40 hours of built-in battery life, and it's also a crush-proof Pelican case.\n\nLoad it up with any particularly fragile items and plug the bass port with an\nincluded rubber stopper, and you've got yourself an everything-proof box to\nkeep your stuff safe. Add to the fact that the speaker sounds remarkably good,\nwith two large drivers that pump out a lot of sound, and this is our favorite\nspeaker to take to the beach, campground, or mountain. We also like that\nthey're made in the US and fully serviceable by DemerBox, so the somewhat\nsteep entry price is actually justifiable long-term.\n\n[$339 at\nAmazon](https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxpYnBLRAjYRCDGFtYjrV1VBXQWC9DcH7HFDxzrgidpG24BDW16XzkSi28P5un2ryMe?cid=5b103e5652d92f2e003123ef)\n\n  * ![Scosche speaker](https://media.wired.com/photos/5b91b7c9957bd64b93788266/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/Scosche-BoomBottle-MM-with-Phone-SOURCE-Scosche.jpg)\n\nPhotograph: Scosche\n\n## Honorable Mentions\n\nPretty Good Speakers\n\nHere are a few other good products that didn't quite make the cut.\n\nThe [Oontz Angle 3 speaker ($40)](https://www.amazon.com/OontZ-Angle-Ultra-Hi-\nQuality-Splashproof/dp/B073BVWRSP/) has thousands of positive reviews on\nAmazon and is easily the best dirt-cheap Bluetooth speaker we've ever tested.\nIf you just want something to sing along with in the shower\u2014and you're not a\nstickler for great audio quality\u2014snag one of these.\n\nThe [Bose SoundLink Revolve ($159)](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-\nRevolve-Portable-Bluetooth/dp/B06XCQKTKR/) is nowhere near as endearing as the\nBoom 3 and isn't waterproof (only splash resistant), but you'll be hard-\npressed to find a beer-can-sized speaker that sounds as clear and deep-\nthroated. The controls are easy to use, with verbal audio cues and simple\nBluetooth pairing, and the 12-hour battery life is long enough to make it\nthrough any party.\n\nThe [Scosche BoomBottle ($100)](https://www.amazon.com/BoomBottle-Waterproof-\nIntegrated-MagicMount-Smartphones/dp/B07G2LL6GR/) is built for a lazy day on\nthe river, with a built-in bottle opener and magnets that let it attach to\nphones and other objects like a canoe. It's waterproof too. It does make a\nsound when it turns on and off that didn't bother me but did annoy some\nfriends who used it daily at an office.\n\n[Sony's SRS-XB speaker series\n($66+)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079V81NS8/) is also excellent, with\ngreat bass and colorful LED lights. Its downside is that the volume dips when\nit's low on battery and won't rise back up until it's fully charged.\n\n[![](https://media.wired.com/photos/5acba3ef0810d969021d9ecf/1:1/w_270%2Cc_limit/Jeffrey%252520Van%252520Camp%252520copy.jpg)](/contributor/jeffrey-\nvan-camp)\n\n[Jeffrey Van Camp](/contributor/jeffrey-van-camp) is an editor for WIRED,\nspecializing in personal technology reviews and coverage.
