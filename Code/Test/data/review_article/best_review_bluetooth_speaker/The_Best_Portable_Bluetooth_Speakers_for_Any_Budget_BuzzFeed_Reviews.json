And\nwhether you\u2019re into that indie (ahem, cheap) vibe or you wanna roll baller, we\ntested several options for blasting your favorite tunes on any budget. So open\nyour dorm-room window, crank it up, and let\u2019s get crackin\u2019.\n\n###### ADVERTISEMENT\n\n![](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/wp-content/themes/worthit/assets/red-tag-\none.png)\n\n## AOMAIS Sport II\n\nStarting from $36\n\n### The Details\n\n#### Two 10-Watt Speakers\n\n#### IPX7 Waterproof Rating\n\n#### Weighs 1.41 pounds\n\n#### Rubberized exterior for shock absorption\n\n### What / Who It's Best For\n\n  * ![](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/wp-content/themes/worthit/assets/red-check.svg) College students \n  * ![](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/wp-content/themes/worthit/assets/red-check.svg) People looking for a good gift \n  * ![](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/wp-content/themes/worthit/assets/red-check.svg) People who want a speaker they can take *anywhere* \n\n###  Why We Love It\n\nAOMAIS may not have the name recognition of Harman Kardon, Bose, or Bang &\nOlufsen, but in the short time they\u2019ve been in the game, they\u2019ve managed to\ncarve out a niche making affordable speakers that sound like their more\nexpensive counterparts. We tested a few AOMAIS speakers and the Sport II was\nthe clear favorite in the $ category.\n\nSmall speakers typically suffer from a tinny sound that completely lacks bass,\nbut the AOMAIS Sport II delivers a relatively rich sound range. It\u2019s not going\nto rattle the windows, but unlike many others in this range, there was a\nfullness to the sound that was uncharacteristically deep. While testing, we\ndidn\u2019t just play music \u2014 we played everything from podcasts to phone calls,\neven films. The AOMAIS Sport II punched through the ambient noise and made\nitself heard, which was no small feat.\n\n![Best Portable Bluetooth Speakers Aomais\nfront](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-it/staging/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/07/29210742/best-portable-bluetooth-speaker-aomais-\nfront.jpg)\n\nThe exterior of the speaker has tough rubberized edges and a metal mesh that\ncovers the two 10-watt speakers. Weighing in just under 1.5 pounds, this thing\ncan easily handle a rough-and-tumble life, bouncing around inside a backpack\nor balancing on bicycle handlebars. We literally threw it against a wall while\nit was playing and there was no interruption in the sound. It seems to be a\nglutton for punishment.\n\n**Speaker fact:** One of the key factors that determine how loud a speaker can\nget is wattage. A lot of times you\u2019ll see this in the product description:\n\u201c50-watt subwoofer!\u201d This refers to how much power the speaker draws.\nBasically, the higher that number is, the louder the speaker can get.\n\nThe AOMAIS Sport II packs in two speakers at 10 watts each for a total of 20\nwatts, a rarity in the $ category. This gives it the power to pump up the\nvolume and still be heard no matter what\u2019s happening around it. The IPX7\nrating means that it can be submerged in up to 1.5 meters of water for 30\nminutes and suffer no ill effects, as long as you close the charging-port\ncover.\n\n![Best Portable Bluetooth Speakers Aomais USB](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-\nit/staging/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/29210800/best-portable-bluetooth-\nspeaker-aomais-usb-aux.jpg)\n\nThe battery charges in a flash, provided you define \u201ca flash\u201d as \u201cabout 2.5\nhours. That charge lasts up to 12 hours, depending on factors like volume;\nplaying it at full volume drains the battery in about seven hours. It can even\nbe paired with other AOMAIS speakers to create a true \u201csurround\u201d sound.\n\nPriced at $40, this little thing can\u2019t be beat. It makes a great gift for\nanyone who wants to bring their music wherever they go. From the beach to the\nbathroom, the AOMAIS Sport II is an awesome option that sounds like it costs\nWAY more.\n\n### User Reviews\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n> \u201cBest speaker I've ever purchased.

User-friendly interface\n> with a bonus of waterproof and shockproof.

Some said it was \u201cugly.\u201d We said that didn\u2019t\nmatter, because it sounded good. To settle this tiff, we played each of the\nspeakers in this category, one after the other, and didn\u2019t tell testers which\none was which. And what did they pick as the best? The G-Project G-Boom. To be\nsure, we didn\u2019t claim this portable boombox was pretty, we just think it\ndoesn\u2019t matter \u2014 and when you\u2019re packing this much bass, it\u2019s not about looks.\nIt\u2019s about that sweet, sweet sound.\n\n![Best Portable Bluetooth Speakers G-Boom\nhandle](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-it/staging/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/07/29211039/best-portable-bluetooth-speaker-g-boom-\nhandle.jpg)\n\nJust about EVERY reviewer mentions the bass the G-Boom can kick out, and for\ngood reason. Dual bass ports on the back of the unit allow thunderous low\nnotes to emanate from its body. Many of the speakers we tested in the $$ range\njust didn\u2019t have the physical size to incorporate speakers big enough to\ngenerate this kind of volume. And even though it couldn\u2019t beat them, the\nG-Boom could definitely hold its own against the competitors in the $$$\ncategory, for a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe boxy design is sturdily constructed and includes an integrated carrying\nhandle. At 6.5 pounds, it\u2019s easier to carry than its size suggests, and it\neven includes ports to clip on a carry strap if you prefer that method. It\nalso includes a USB port so you can charge your phone while you\u2019re out.\n\n![Best Portable Bluetooth Speakers G-Boom\nlogo](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-it/staging/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/07/29211114/best-portable-bluetooth-speaker-g-boom-\nfront.jpg)\n\n**Speaker fact:** Wattage isn\u2019t the ONLY consideration for a speaker\u2019s volume,\nespecially when it comes to thumping bass. In order to generate deep, punchy\nbass notes, a subwoofer needs to push air, which is why you often see\nsubwoofers built into wooden boxes. This space, just like the empty space of a\ncello or a guitar, gives the sound a depth and richness that isn\u2019t possible\notherwise.\n\nThe larger size of the G-Boom allows for exactly this kind of depth. Behind\nthe two main speakers are corresponding bass ports that give it the deep sound\nfor which it has become known. Outdoors, it has the volume to stand out over\nambient noise; indoors, it can add unexpected punch to movies, particularly\nduring action-heavy scenes.\n\nThe G-Boom comes with an EQ button that allows you to choose from three\npresets. This is handy when you want to switch from listening to rap to a\npodcast, for example, because it allows you to push the sounds you most want\nto hear to the forefront.\n\n![Best Portable Bluetooth Speakers G-Boom\ncontrol](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-it/staging/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/07/29211228/best-portable-bluetooth-speaker-g-boom-\ncontrols.jpg)\n\nOne of the presets prioritizes the low end, and the other two push the middle\nand high notes, respectively. While testing it for music, we played live\nperformances, studio cuts, and even fan-made recordings. Most of the time, the\nmidtone-prioritizing EQ setting gave the best results. For podcasts, even the\nmore treble-friendly EQ sounded a little fuzzy since the G-Boom is built to\nbump bass. It may not be the best option for spoken-word, but hey, that\u2019s not\nwhy you would buy this thing anyway.\n\nHowever, all that sonic power comes at a price, and not just the $80+ sticker\nprice: The G-Boom\u2019s battery lasts only about six hours. Luckily, it reaches\nfull battery in about 2.5 hours.\n\n### User Reviews\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n> \u201cI've been researching and buying speakers for some time studying what style\n> and design I could use when I perform my music on the streets.

Just dang. This freakin\u2019 thing\u2026we started out NOT wanting to\nlike the Ultimate Ears Megablast because of a bad experience with another UE\nspeaker. One of our testers immediately took it out of the box and dropped it\non the floor, hoping it would break and they could write it off. \u201cBummer,\u201d\nthey would have written in the notes to the team. \u201cIt broke. Next!\u201d But it\ndidn\u2019t.\n\nSo we begrudgingly charged it up and downloaded the app onto our phones. To\nour surprise, we found a much more fully featured speaker than many of the\nhigher-priced models we were testing.\n\n![Best Portable Bluetooth Speakers Ultimate Ears\nlogo](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-it/staging/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/07/29211533/best-portable-bluetooth-speaker-ultimate-\nears-branding.jpg)\n\nTo begin with, the UE app includes an equalizer. Not just presets (though it\nhas that, too), but a custom setting that allows you to dial in the exact type\nof sound you like for whatever you\u2019re rockin\u2019. For podcasts, you can lighten\nup the high notes. For hip-hop, up goes the bass. And for anything else, you\ncan tweak it to your heart\u2019s content.\n\nIt has been said that in the background of the _Adventure Time_ theme song,\nyou can hear someone typing on a keyboard in the background \u2014 but using the UE\nMegablast as a computer speaker was the first time we could actually hear it.\nCrickets in the background during _True Detective_ (Season 1, duh) sounded\nlike they were somewhere IN the room.\n\n![Best Portable Bluetooth Speakers Ultimate Ears\nstanding](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-it/staging/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/07/29211729/best-portable-bluetooth-speaker-ultimate-\nears-standing.jpg)\n\nWe\u2019ve experienced latency issues before while using a Bluetooth speaker with a\ndesktop, where the sound was out of sync by up to two seconds (the Amazon Tap\nis especially bad in this regard), but the UE Megablast had no such issues. It\nwoke up and connected whenever the computer did, and since it comes with\nAlexa, it replaced the Tap as our testers\u2019 external computer speaker.\n\nThe version of Alexa that currently ships with the UE Megablast is kind of a\n\u201clite\u201d version of the smart home assistant. While, for instance, voice control\nfor Spotify and Spotify Connect are available, certain features, such as\nadding it to a multiroom speaker array, are not (though the company expects to\nrectify this soon).\n\n![Best Portable Bluetooth Speakers Ultimate Ears\ntop](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-it/staging/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/07/29211817/best-portable-bluetooth-speaker-ultimate-\nears-top.jpg)\n\n**Speaker fact:** IP ratings are designed to let you know how protected your\nspeaker is from the elements. IPX ratings usually take only water into\naccount, while IP ratings consider water and dust. The UE Megablast is\nIP67-rated \u2014 that is, it can be fully submerged in up to a meter of water for\n30 minutes and is virtually impenetrable to dust. This means you can take it\nwith you anywhere, and the 16-hour battery life means it will perform all day\nlong without dying, even at louder volumes.\n\nThe physical design is sleek, as are most of the options included in the app,\nand the Megablast fits in quite well among other tech toys. On board, there\u2019s\na power switch, Bluetooth button, and the \u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201d volume buttons that\nalmost all UE products have.\n\nThe Megablast delivers on all counts, giving you a versatile sound solution\nthat you can take anywhere. At home, the sound will easily fill a room while\nalso providing access to the Internet of Things and even Alexa. No other\nspeaker in the $$$ range can do all that \u2014 and this makes the Megablast an\neasy option for our top pick.\n\n_Correction: Voice control for Spotify and Spotify Connect *are* available for\nthis product; an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that they\nwere not._\n\n### User Reviews\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n> \u201cBass output is second to no other device with Alexa onboard.

I had to do a reset the first day I used it \u2014 after I turned\n> it off it would not turn back on. Only had this problem once and I think it\n> was because I tried to play a song with bass 80 hz or lower; the speaker\n> didn't seem to handle it well. However, for normal songs the bass is fine,\n> and if you don't use Alexa or connect to Wi-Fi you get a lot more battery\n> life.\u201d\n\n\u2014 david ryals [From Amazon](https://amzn.to/2P21AiU)\n\nUltimate Ears\n\nPortable, powerful and pretty\n\n![](https://img.buzzfeed.com/worth-it/staging/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/07/29211322/best-portable-bluetooth-speaker-ultimate-\nears-volume.jpg?output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&downsize=1024:*)\n\n### Where to buy\n\n[ **$165 at Amazon** ](https://amzn.to/2Ln2tRD)\n\n###### ADVERTISEMENT\n\n### Our Most Recent Reviews\n\n[\n\n#### The Best Scissors\n\n](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/best-scissors/)\n\n[\n\n#### The Best Air Mattresses\n\n](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/best-air-mattresses/)\n\n[\n\n#### The Best Vibrators\n\n](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/best-vibrators/)\n\n[\n\n#### The Best Fitness Trackers\n\n](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/best-fitness-trackers/)\n\n### Company\n\n  * [About Us](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/who-we-are/)\n  * [BuzzFeed.com](https://www.buzzfeed.com)\n  * [User Agreement](https://www.buzzfeed.com/about/useragreement)\n  * [Consent Preferences](https://www.buzzfeed.com/consent-preferences)\n  * [Ad Choices](https://www.buzzfeed.com/about/privacy#adchoices)\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.buzzfeed.com/about/privacy)\n\n### Sections\n\n  * [All](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/category/all/)\n  * [Tech](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/category/tech/)\n  * [Beauty](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/category/beauty/)\n  * [Home](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/category/home/)\n  * [Lifestyle](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/category/lifestyle/)\n  * [The Journal](https://www.buzzfeed.com/reviews/articles/)\n\n### Follow Us\n\n  * [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/buzzfeedreviews/)\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedShopping/)\n\n### Get the BuzzFeed Reviews Newsletter\n\nThe best stuff no matter your budget, in your inbox weekly.
