Plus it\u2019ll float, should it take an\nunexpected dunk.\n\nBattery life is a generous 20 hours for on-the-go, and a button on the top of\nthe Megaboom \u2013 the so-called 'Magic button' \u2013 handles playback with a series\nof taps. You can even call up a favourite playlist if you\u2019ve loaded into the\nUE app.\n\nSpeaking of the app, you can stereo pair the Megaboom 3 from here, too, or\ndaisy chain it with other UE speakers for an even more powerful performance.\n\nNot that you\u2019re likely to need it. The Megaboom 3 does a great job on its own,\nand serves up a fun and enthusiastic performance that\u2019s not shy on detail or\nexpression. It\u2019s a really natural, well-balanced sound \u2013 there\u2019s a touch of\nbass lean but it only helps to make it a more solid and confident sound.\n\n**Also consider:** The **[UE Megablast (\u00a3148)](https://amzn.to/2LKM7SK)** adds\nAlexa to the usual (winning) UE formula.

There\u2019s even a hint of design flair with the oversized\ncontrols that adorn the top of the speaker, and a choice of colours, in black,\nred or blue.\n\nWhen it comes to sound quality, there are obvious compromises to be made here,\nbut manage your expectations and the SoundCore 2 produces a very enjoyable\nsound indeed. It\u2019s a bold, confident performance that contradicts the thin,\nfragile effort that cheaper speakers are often responsible for.\n\nIt\u2019s not the most powerful, nor can it create the booming bass of larger\nspeakers, but its midrange is clear and forward, and the treble dodges\nharshness like a ninja. For a speaker of its price, it\u2019s a very pleasant\nperformance indeed.\n\n#### Read next\n\n  * [The best cameras for travel, creative and street photography](/article/best-cameras)\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/A6ZR2aDRVxZ/crop/200/square/f/wired-recommends-\ncameras-1.jpg)\n\n###  The best cameras for travel, creative and street photography\n\n* * *\n\nBy WIRED\n\n**Pros:** Well-priced; solid, confident sound; rugged design  \n **Cons:** Lacks bass punch; not the most powerful\n\n **Price:** \u00a340 | **[Check price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2JZsEBs)**\n\n### Sonos Move\n\n **The portable Sonos speaker we've been waiting for**\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/dnNy44JLX5p/crop/405/f/sonos-wr-bluetooth-\nupdate.jpg)\n\n**Weight:** 3kg | **Size:** 240 x 160 x 126mm | **Battery life:** 10 hours |\n**Waterproof:** Yes (IP56) | **Total power:** Undisclosed | **Aux-in** No\n\n#### Read next\n\n  * [We tested all those bed-in-a-box mattresses.

These are the best\n\n* * *\n\nBy Emily Peck\n\nFinally. That was our first response to the **[Sonos Move\n(\u00a3399)](https://amzn.to/36l3xQX)**. It's a proper Sonos speaker, with four Wi-\nFi antennae, and a Bluetooth speaker that's just as at home indoors and out.\n\nThe Move is battery powered (about ten hours), weather-proof\n(rain/cold/heat/sun-proof) and voice-controlled (built-in Alexa and Google\nAssistant). It's also _technically_ portable, though do bear in mind that this\nthing weighs 3kg. Pair two Moves for stereo or add one to your multi-room\nSonos system.\n\nThis is a very thoughtful product, which won't surprise Sonos owners. The Wi-\nFi range is good enough so that you shouldn't need to switch to Bluetooth to\nuse a Move or two in the garden. We also really like the refinement of\nTrueplay with auto recalibration every time you move the speaker to a new\nposition, using data from smartphone mics and mapping done by Sonos. It's very\neffective in use.\n\nThere's a few tech niggles but we can live with them. The Bluetooth itself\nisn't the latest spec, aptX is MIA and there's no support for hi-res audio\neither.\n\nInside there's a pair of Class D amplifiers, a downward-firing tweeter and a\nforward-facing mid-bass driver. When connected to Wi-Fi, the Move produces a\ndriving, powerful sound and it's loud enough as a loudspeaker to hold its own\nin the great outdoors. Switch to Bluetooth and the soundstage becomes slightly\nless defined, though still superb for the category. Think of the Sonos Move as\na more assertive Play:5; it's that impressive.\n\n#### Read next\n\n  * [These are the best noise-cancelling headphones in 2020](/article/best-noise-cancelling-headphones)\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/D3WLYDBMW73/crop/200/square/f/hero-best-noise-\ncancelling-8.jpg)\n\n###  These are the best noise-cancelling headphones in 2020\n\n* * *\n\nBy WIRED\n\n**Pros:** Accomplished sound; Auto Trueplay; terrific app  \n**Cons:** The price; 'only' Bluetooth 4.2; no hi-res\n\n **Price:** \u00a3399 | **[Check price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/36l3xQX) | [John\nLewis](https://www.johnlewis.com/sonos-move-smart-speaker-with-voice-control-\nblack/p4361194)**\n\n### Anker Soundcore Flare 2\n\n **The best Bluetooth speaker under \u00a3100**\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/dmLrLKk1YQ8/crop/405/f/1.jpg)\n\n**Weight:** 585g | **Size:** 16 x 8.9 x 8.9cm | **Battery life:** 12 hours |\n**Waterproof:** Yes (IPX7) | **Total power:** 20W | **Aux-in:** No\n\n#### Read next\n\n  * [The best iPhone 11 cases you can buy right now](/article/best-iphone-11-case)\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/lK9NkMKvLGO/crop/200/square/f/10a.jpg)\n\n###  The best iPhone 11 cases you can buy right now\n\n* * *\n\nBy WIRED\n\nAnker really is making a name for itself in the affordable Bluetooth speaker\nmarket, and the **[Flare 2 (\u00a365)](https://amzn.to/2Xcy1Cd)** sits rightfully\non top of the pile.\n\nAt 16cm tall and 585g, it\u2019s perfect for chucking in your bag, while its IPX7\nwaterproof rating means you haven\u2019t got to worry about splashes, spills or\ndownpours.\n\nTo give it a bit of personality in a crowded market, the Flare 2 has an LED\nring around the top and bottom of the speaker, which produces a rainbow-\ncoloured lightshow that moves in time to your tunes. Anker has an app (free,\nAndroid/iOS), which allows you to customise what you see, or turn it off\nentirely if you\u2019re trying to retain the battery.\n\nThat battery should run for around 12 hours at a decent volume level, and\nthere\u2019s an auto shut off that helps you to save juice when the speaker isn\u2019t\nin use. It charges via the covered USB-C port on the back, which is its only\ninput, meaning there\u2019s no hardwiring via 3.5mm here.\n\nSpeaking of volume, and this little speaker has plenty of it. That doesn\u2019t\nmean you should use it all, though. Stick to around 75% and lower and you\u2019ll\nget the best from its sound quality \u2013 higher than that and you\u2019ll hear some\ndistortion start to creep in.\n\n#### Read next\n\n  * [The best barbecues and pizza ovens, gas and charcoal](/article/best-bbq-gas-and-charcoal)\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/R8lMmzmQM1a/crop/200/square/f/hero-wired-recommends-\nbbqs-alt-3.jpg)\n\n###  The best barbecues and pizza ovens, gas and charcoal\n\n* * *\n\nBy WIRED\n\nKeep it in a comfortable range though and the speaker has a really nice\nbalance for something so small and affordable. The BassUp feature helps to\ngive some added weight and authority to the low end that is lacking without\nit, but ensure it is switched on and the speaker has a very likeable warm and\nfull-bodied character.\n\nThis is supported by an impressively clean midrange and good, crisp highs,\nwhich creates an overall sense of solidity that is not always a given at this\nprice point. The 360-degree sound the Flare 2 promises is effective too,\noffering a good spread of sound in a decent-sized room without losing any of\nits impact.\n\n **Pros:** Solid sound for the price; waterproof; lights are a fun touch  \n **Cons:** Bass is lacking in normal mode; distortion creeps in at high volume\n\n **Price:** \u00a365 | **[Check price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Xcy1Cd)**\n\n### UE Wonderboom 2\n\n **A sub-\u00a3100 alternative with long battery life**\n\n#### Read next\n\n  * [The (actually good) tech deals in Amazon\u2019s Summer Sale](/article/amazon-summer-sale-2020)\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/23XaglX1YKO/crop/200/square/f/7.jpg)\n\n###  The (actually good) tech deals in Amazon\u2019s Summer Sale\n\n* * *\n\nBy WIRED\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/0rvGRwno1pd/crop/405/f/wired-recommends-ue-\nwonderboom.jpg)\n\n**Weight:** 420g | **Size:** 220mm x 95mm x 93mm | **Battery life:** 13 hours\n| **Waterproof:** Yes (IP67) | **Aux-in** No\n\nThe second of three UE speakers in this list, here the boom might be slightly\nless mega, but it's apparently full of wonder instead. The delightfully dinky\n**[Wonderboom 2 (\u00a369)](https://amzn.to/2XgI0mJ)** is a go-to sub-\u00a3100\nrecommendation for the second summer going.\n\nEverything is slightly bigger this time around: the sound, the dimensions\n(though it's still small) and the battery life. Let's start with the sound,\nwhich is balanced and detailed no matter what frequencies you throw at it, and\nthere's some extra oomph in the low end, compared to the original Wonderboom,\nwithout overdoing it.\n\nAs ever, you get an array of colour combinations to select from, but the real\nstory here is the robust build and IP67 rating for waterproofing in up to a\nmetre of water and bonus dustproofing. It's park, pool and beach-proof and\nit'll go and go for 13 hours straight. All of the performance you could want\nfrom \u00a390 worth of Bluetooth speaker.\n\n**Pros:** Terrific, balanced sound; long 13-hour battery life  \n**Cons:** At this price? Not a chance\n\n **Price:** \u00a369 | **[Check price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2XgI0mJ)** |\n**[John Lewis](https://www.johnlewis.com/ultimate-ears-wonderboom-2-bluetooth-\nwaterproof-portable-speaker/deep-space-black/p4193097)**\n\n### JBL Charge 4\n\n **The best waterproof speaker**\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/1MlP1QlkGOK/crop/405/f/bluetooth-wired-recommends-\nnew-4.jpg)\n\n**Weight:** 960g | **Size:** 220mm x 95mm x 93mm | **Battery life:** 20 hours\n| **Waterproof:** Yes (IPX7) | **Total power:** 30W | **Aux-in** Yes\n\nThe JBL Charge family has long been a go-to for anyone that needs a quality\nportable speaker that won\u2019t die a death in a Great British downpour. This\nfourth iteration offers a larger battery at 7,500mAh for 20 hours of music\nplayback, a more powerful 30-watt sound output, and a USB-C connection for\nfaster recharging.\n\nElsewhere, it\u2019s got everything that we\u2019ve come to know and love from the\nCharge line \u2013 a sturdy, rugged design, IPX7 waterproof rating and the ability\nto use it as a battery pack to charge your phone if caught short.\n\nThe **[JBL Charge 4 (\u00a3160)](https://amzn.to/2WzUPZw)** falls into that mid-\nsize portable speaker category \u2013 your arm will know if you\u2019re carrying it\naround in your bag for too long, but its sound reaps the benefits a slightly\nbigger design allows.\n\nFor a start, it\u2019s really powerful, with dual passive radiators vibrating at\neither end of the design to ensure its bass response is rich and deep. More\nneutral ears might find it a little bottom heavy if listening indoors, but for\noutdoors listening it is perfect, delivering a confident, punchy sound that\nwon\u2019t be put under pressure by a noisy park or beach.\n\nThe rest of the frequency range is equally solid \u2013 there\u2019s no hint of hardness\nat any point and no distortion when pushed in the volume department either.\nAnd push you can... this thing will go a lot louder than you might expect.\n\n **Pros:** Loud, powerful sound; sturdy design; good battery  \n**Cons:** No speakerphone; a little bass-heavy for neutral ears\n\n **Price:** \u00a3160 | **[Check price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2WzUPZw) |\n[Currys](https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/audio-and-headphones/audio/hifi-\nsystems-and-speakers/jbl-charge-4-portable-bluetooth-speaker-\nblack-10188740-pdt.html) **\n\n### JBL Boombox 2\n\n **Unrivalled bass for bass lovers**\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/qQ585W6y1pL/crop/405/f/2.jpg)\n\n**Weight:** 5.9kg | **Size:** 25.7 x 48.5 x 20.1cm | **Battery life:** 24\nhours | **Waterproof:** Yes (IPX7) | **Total power:** 80W | **Aux-in:** Yes\n\nWhile some speakers are all about balance, the **[JBL Boombox 2\n(\u00a3400)](https://uk.jbl.com/bluetooth-portables/JBL+BOOMBOX+2-.html)** is\nunashamedly aimed at those who prefer a bit more bass to their beats. And in\nthis second generation of JBL\u2019s largest and most durable Bluetooth speaker,\nyou\u2019ll get more of it than ever.\n\nDespite packing the same driver spec as its predecessor (two 10cm woofers, two\n20mm tweeters and dual passive radiators, since you asked), the Boombox 2\nmanages to put out an extra 10W of power. That means 30W when using the\nbattery and 40W when connected to power.\n\nThe result is that the Boombox 2 goes louder when you need it to, with JBL\u2019s\nSignature Pro Sound doing its bit to ensure the bass makes the most of the\nextra wallop. It doesn\u2019t sacrifice any battery life in the process either,\nwith an impressive 24 hours of playback at average volume. That\u2019ll decrease as\nyou push the sound louder, but you can still expect a good eight hours or so\nat top whack.\n\nIn homage to its 90s namesake, it has a built-in handle with improved grip,\nhelping you carry it from block party to block party \u2013 or, more likely, from\nthe kitchen to the garden when the sun comes out. Weighing almost 6kg, you\nprobably won\u2019t want to take it much further, but chucking it in your car for a\ntrip to the park or beach isn\u2019t totally out of the question.\n\nIt\u2019s IPX7 water resistant, for those oh-so-unpredictable British summers, and\nalongside an improved Bluetooth 5.1 connection, offers up a 3.5mm jack and\nUSB-A for device charging. There\u2019s also Party Boost, JBL\u2019s proprietary tech,\nwhich allows you to pair it with JBL\u2019s most recent speakers \u2013 namely another\nBoombox 2, the Pulse 4 or Flip 5.\n\nAs for how this thing sounds, expect power and then some. There\u2019s arguably\nmore volume here than you\u2019ll ever need, but outside the extra bump certainly\nhelps, and it\u2019s impressively distortion free up until the last 10% or so. The\nbass still arguably steals the limelight, but there\u2019s better balance here than\nin the first JBL Boombox. Highs and mids have more presence, which makes for\nan enjoyable, considered listen.\n\n**Pros:** Really loud; rich, rumbling bass; great battery life  \n **Cons:** Balance won\u2019t be for everyone; heavy\n\n **Price:** \u00a3400 | **[Check price on JBL](https://uk.jbl.com/bluetooth-\nportables/JBL+BOOMBOX+2-.html)**\n\n### AudioPro Addon T3\n\n **The audiophile's choice**\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/Kbz1ODzB4Z4/crop/405/f/bluetooth-wired-recommends-\nnew-6.jpg)\n\n**Weight:** 5.25kg | **Size:** 115mm x 215mm x 135mm | **Battery life:** 30\nhours | **Waterproof:** No | **Total power:** 20W | **Aux-in** Yes\n\nAudioPro might not be a brand you\u2019ve heard a lot of, but the Scandinavian\ncompany has a 40-year heritage in hi-fi products that\u2019s resulted in a stellar\nline-up of powered wireless speakers.\n\nThe **[Addon T3 (\u00a3149)](https://amzn.to/3gFGbuy)** is the only portable option\nin the range, and is perhaps a little on the chunky side for throwing in your\ncase to go on holiday. It is, however, a great size for moving around the\nhouse, taking into the garden or chucking into your car for a beach trip or\npicnic. Its battery life is great, too, offering up to 30 hours at moderate\nvolume.\n\nIts extra size helps with its sonic ability as well, sounding solid in the low\nend, expressive through the midrange and clear and open in the treble. It\u2019s a\nvery natural performance \u2013 one that is balanced and dynamic, but also hugely\nengaging.\n\nIt\u2019s just at home with slower, brooding music as it is an upbeat dance track,\ntoo, so whatever you throw at it will sound superb. It's one of the best\nsounding Bluetooth speakers around, especially at this price.\n\n **Pros:** Excellent sound; USB port for charging devices; solid build  \n**Cons:** Size isn\u2019t for all situations\n\n**Price:** \u00a3149 | **[Check price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3gFGbuy) |\n[Currys](https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/audio-and-headphones/audio/hifi-\nsystems-and-speakers/audio-pro-addon-t3-portable-bluetooth-wireless-speaker-\ngrey-10152125-pdt.html) **\n\n### Dali Katch\n\n **The premium option**\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/ZVjwZ00G64P/crop/405/f/dali-katch.jpg)\n\n**Weight:** 1.1kg | **Size:** 138mm x 268mm x 47mm | **Battery life:** 24\nhours | **Waterproof:** No | **Total power:** 50W | **Aux-in** Yes\n\nYou might have heard of Dali from its more traditional dealings in 'proper'\nhi-fi speakers, and that experience shines through here in its first Bluetooth\noffering.\n\nFor its size, the **[Dali Katch's (\u00a3329)](https://amzn.to/2Mng2RN)** price tag\nmight seem a little on the heavy side. But that\u2019s all put to rest with your\nfirst listen. It\u2019s a full-bodied, yet subtle listen, fully aware of any\nintricacies in a recording that other speakers of its type might gloss over.\n\nIt\u2019s a bigger sound than its size might suggest it capable of, too, with\nplenty of space for dynamics to have a field day. All that, and it looks the\npart \u2013 slim, portable and sturdy, with a handy slide out leather carry handle\nand a 24-hour battery life to boot.\n\n **Pros:** Well-built; superb sound; good battery life  \n **Cons:** Pricey for its size\n\n **Price:** \u00a3329 | **[Check price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Mng2RN) |\n[Richer Sounds](https://www.richersounds.com/dali-bluetooth-speaker.html) **\n\n### B&O Play Beolit 17\n\n **Powerful and loud**\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/N3q2J8XKpVZ/crop/405/f/Beolit17-17JS-08.jpg)\n\n**Weight:** 2.7kg | **Size:** 230mm x 189mm x 135mm | **Battery life:** 24\nhours | **Waterproof:** No | **Total power:** 70W | **Aux-in** Yes\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a big budget and want the loudest speaker possible, the **[B&O\nPlay Beolit 17 (\u00a3351)](https://amzn.to/2l38CqD)** has to be on your shortlist.\n\nTo produce so much noise (70W in fact), this is definitely on the larger size\nof what you\u2019d consider to be portable. But it does come with a picnic basket-\nlike handle \u2013 in leather, of course \u2013 for you to lug it around.\n\nBeing a B&O product, it looks the part elsewhere, too. Every last detail is\nthought of in its mostly metal design \u2013 even down to its rubberised top\nsection for safely placing your phone.\n\nIt has a 24-hour battery life from a short 2.5-hour charge, and charges via\nUSB-C. There\u2019s also a 3.5mm input for hardwiring devices.\n\nAs for its sound, it goes as big as you\u2019d expect it to, but is also hugely\narticulate, keeping even the most complicated recordings in line. If its\nbalance doesn\u2019t quite work for your tastes, the B&O app is worth a download,\nwhere you can tweak the EQ to suit.\n\n **Pros:** Huge sound; well built; tweakable EQ  \n **Cons:** No waterproofing; expensive\n\n **Price:** \u00a3351 | **[Check price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2XpDrcS) | [John\nLewis](https://www.johnlewis.com/bang-olufsen-beolit17-portable-bluetooth-\nspeaker/p3172286)**\n\n### Bose SoundLink Revolve+\n\n **Outstanding 360-degree sound**\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/54jrwmPwYdM/crop/405/f/bose-revolve-silver.jpg)\n\n**Weight:** 2.7kg | **Size:** 184mm x 105mm x 105mm | **Battery life:** 16\nhours | **Waterproof:** Yes (IPX4) | **Aux-in** Yes\n\nBose has proved itself time and time again when it comes to its audio prowess,\nand its new Revolve range of wireless speakers only helps to reiterate that\nonce more.\n\nThe two speakers in the line-up have a near identical range of features, but\nthe **[SoundLink Revolve+ (\u00a3220)](https://amzn.to/2Jynf3W)** would be our pick\nof the duo for its bigger, bolder sound and improved battery life (up from 12\nhours to 16 hours). It also has a carry handle for easier portability.\n\nThe Revolve range\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre is its 360-degree sound \u2013 Bose\u2019s first\nomnidirectional speakers \u2013 which is helped along by the stylish cylindrical\ndesign.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect from Bose, build quality is solid and every detail has been\naccounted for \u2013 there\u2019s even a microphone so you can activate the Siri or\nGoogle Assistant functionality on your phone.\n\nThe spread of sound is great and effective through its 360 degrees. The sound\nis warm but not boomy, and there\u2019s plenty of detail, too. To give it its\nlively, upfront sound, the treble is a touch on the bright side, so try to\nfeed it good quality music so you can hear it at its best.\n\n **Pros:** Excellent spread of sound; good battery life; stylish design  \n **Cons:** Can be a touch bright at volume\n\n**Price:** \u00a3220 | **[Check price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Jynf3W) | [John\nLewis](https://www.johnlewis.com/bose-soundlink-revolve-water-resistant-\nportable-bluetooth-speaker-with-built-in-speakerphone-handle/lux-\ngrey/p3214221) **\n\n## How to choose the best Bluetooth speaker for you\n\nAside from the sound quality, which we've got covered in our reviews above,\nmost of the considerations you'll need to think about when choosing a\nBluetooth speaker are fairly practical.\n\n##### Advertisement\n\nHow much do you want to pay? You can now get a great device for as low as \u00a340.\nHow big and how portable a speaker are you looking for? Backpack friendly or\ncar-boot friendly? And on that note, always check the weight, which we've also\nlisted, if you'll be carrying it around.\n\nDepending on where you'll be using the speaker \u2013 around the house, in the\ngarden, by the pool, camping, on the beach \u2013 you'll also be interested in the\nbattery life on offer. The speakers on test range from 10 hours to over 30\nhours, all pretty respectable but a considerable range if, say, you're taking\none of these to a festival.\n\nThen it's down to prioritising extras like waterproofing and dustproofing,\nstereo pairing, aux in (old-school but helpful), plus more new-fangled\nfeatures in the category such as Alexa voice controls and USB for charging\ndevices.\n\n  * [WIRED Recommends](/topic/wired-recommends \"WIRED Recommends\")\n  * [Gear](/topic/gear \"Gear\")\n  * [Audio](/topic/audio \"Audio\")\n\n#### Share this article\n\n  * [ Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=166725050017831&display=popup&href=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/best-bluetooth-speakers-best-portable-speakers&redirect_uri=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/best-bluetooth-speakers-best-portable-speakers&picture=https://wi-images.condecdn.net/image/Vlr0Mz7mL8d/crop/1440/0.5235602094240838/f/bluetooth-wired-recommends-new.jpg \"facebook\")\n  * [ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/best-bluetooth-speakers-best-portable-speakers&text=The%20best%20Bluetooth%20speakers%20for%20any%20budget \"twitter\")\n  * [ WhatsApp ](whatsapp://send?text=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/best-bluetooth-speakers-best-portable-speakers \"whatsapp\")\n  * [ Email ](mailto:?body=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/best-bluetooth-speakers-best-portable-speakers&subject=The%20best%20Bluetooth%20speakers%20for%20any%20budget \"email\")\n\n###  Recommended\n\n  * [The best drones for any budget](/article/best-drone)\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/xgjnk86RnZn/crop/200/square/f/8.jpg)\n\n###  The best drones for any budget\n\n* * *\n\nBy WIRED\n\n    * WIRED Recommends\n    * 05 Jul 2020\n\n  * [The best hairdryers for any budget](/article/best-hairdryers)\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/eBMGbZEvPnL/crop/200/square/f/wired-recommends-\napril-winner.jpg)\n\n###  The best hairdryers for any budget\n\n* * *\n\nBy WIRED\n\n    * WIRED Recommends\n    * 01 May 2020\n\n  * [The best electric shavers for any budget](/article/best-electric-shaver)\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/nWe7mQakean/crop/200/square/f/awired-recommends-\napril.jpg)\n\n###  The best electric shavers for any budget\n\n* * *\n\nBy WIRED\n\n    * WIRED Recommends\n    * 06 Oct 2019\n\n  *   * [The best vacuum cleaners for any budget](/article/best-vacuum-cleaner)\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/6kJb7kxeXm2/crop/200/square/f/dyson-hero.jpg)\n\n###  The best vacuum cleaners for any budget\n\n* * *\n\nBy WIRED\n\n    * WIRED Recommends\n    * 19 May 2019\n\n  * Cond\u00e9 Nast Britain\n  * [Privacy policy and cookie statement](https://www.condenast.co.uk/privacy/)\n  * [Code of Conduct](https://www.condenast.co.uk/code-of-conduct/)\n  * [Terms & conditions](https://www.condenast.co.uk/terms/)\n  * [Editorial Complaints Policy](https://www.condenast.co.uk/complaints/policy/)\n  * [Careers](https://www.condenast.co.uk/careers/)\n  * [Contact](/contact-us)\n  * \u00a9 Cond\u00e9 Nast Britain 2020\n  * Wired UK\n\n"}
