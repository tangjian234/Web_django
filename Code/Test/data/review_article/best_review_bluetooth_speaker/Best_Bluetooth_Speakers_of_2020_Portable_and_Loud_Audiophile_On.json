We focus on\nour top recommendations for loud and portable wireless speakers.\n\nDo you want to know the best Bluetooth speakers you can buy in 2020?. No doubt\nit\u2019s getting confusing. There are thousands of Bluetooth speakers on the\nmarket and it\u2019s not always easy telling the bad from the good ones. Its almost\nimpossible for buyers to compare more than a limited few speakers at a time in\nyour local electronics store. You might be missing out on something better for\nthe money. Luckily we have had access to some of the best Bluetooth speakers,\nportable speakers & travel speakers in the world. We have tested and reviewed\nmost of them and we have put together this list together to make sure you get\nthe best bang for your buck.\n\n## What size is best for a portable speaker?\n\nFor the purposes of this list, we will only be including 2 types of Bluetooth\nspeakers. Pocket-able ones which we consider to be ultra-portable. These are\nthe kind you wouldn\u2019t think too much about taking them on camping trips or to\nthe park etc. They are lightweight, compact and rugged.\n\nWe will also recommend some mid-sized ones that will fit in a bag or backpack.\nWe consider these transportable. When I say in a bag I don\u2019t mean filling up\nthe full volume of your backpack either. No, these speakers are meant to just\nbe an accessory you bring with you when you travel. These will usually trade\nof some of the portability in exchange for a fuller sound and better battery\nlife.\n\nSo when choosing Bluetooth speakers you first want to consider how and where\nyou are going to use them. If you think you are going to be traveling a lot do\nyou really want to carry something that is big, bulky and heavy? Conversely,\nsay you are able to take a larger speaker in your luggage would it be worth it\nto have better sound quality when you get to your destination.\n\nSo whether you are someone that wants to buy a wireless speaker to be used\nboth around the home and when you are traveling, camping or hiking there are\nplenty of great options below for every budget. However, if you are still\nhaving trouble deciding then please feel free to drop me a message via email\nor Facebook and I can offer you some further advice on the best model for your\nneeds.\n\n## Key considerations when purchasing the best Bluetooth speakers!\n\nOur thought process when putting together this list took some time to resolve.\nTherefore to help decide the best speaker for your needs you should probably\nknow what we consider to be important factors in the buying process.\n\nI have had plenty of travel speakers over the years and have a well-defined\nidea of what I think makes the best one. What might be best for you could be\ncompletely different but here are some key areas to consider before you buy.\n\n  * Sound Quality - I want the biggest bang for my buck.\n\n  * Build Quality - I want something that is going to withstand the abuse I will put it through\n\n  * Size - Medium or small size in balance with the other factors in this list.\n\n  * Battery Life - Minimum 8 hours of battery life is a must as i don\u2019t want to charge it every day.\n\n  * Bonus features - SD card inputs, Using as a Portable battery bank, External DAC connections, remotes etc.\n\n## Sound Quality - What is the best sounding bluetooth speaker?\n\nBy far the most common question we get asked on this topic is :\n\nWhat is the best sounding Bluetooth speaker?\n\nThe answer to this can relate to size and price but there are some really good\nsounding cheap speakers if you look hard enough and do the research. In my\nopinion, the [Minirigs 3.0 is by far the best sounding speaker for its\nsize](https://www.audiophileon.com/news/minirig-mini-review). it\u2019s\nunparalleled in its balance of the above factors and is my personal favorite\nBluetooth speaker.\n\n## Build Quality - What is the most durable Bluetooth speaker?\n\nBuild quality is incredibly important. You, of course, intend to travel with\nthis speaker and as a result, it is destined to lead a far tougher life than a\nspeaker that never moves from your home entertainment system or bedside table.\n\nInevitably over time, these speakers will take a few knocks so you want\nsomething that is going to hold up well. We are looking for high-quality build\nmaterials and a strong chassis as a base. However we should not be overlooking\nthings like waterproofing, robust control buttons, and scratch-proof finishes,\n\n## Size - Portable vs Transportable\n\nI touched on this above but size is pretty important and not just in terms of\nhow you intend to transport the speaker.\n\nSize plays a big roll in a lot of the other factors we listed.\n\nSmaller sized speakers usually have a smaller driver and (the majority of the\ntime) a degradation in sound quality as a result.\n\nBonus features will also take a hit in lightweight portable speakers as there\nis less room in a smaller chassis to store extra functionality.\n\nFinally, size usually has a big impact on battery life. Its common sense, the\nsmaller the housing the less room for a large capacity battery and therefore\nthe less runtime the speaker will have between charges.\n\n## Battery life - What bluetooth speaker has the best battery life?\n\nBattery life should play a huge roll in your buying decision as I assume most\nof you will be using the speaker via Bluetooth. To make this list of the best\nportable speakers I set and an absolute minimum of 8 hours of playback from a\ncharge. T\n\nhat said that is a little to short for me and I would consider 12 hours to be\nthe starting point for decent battery life. Just be aware when you add in\nhigher quality components batter life is going to suffer this is perhaps the\nbiggest trade of when buying a wireless speaker.\n\n## Bonus Features -\n\nSome of these speakers have bonus features that may or may no be useful to you\nwhen choosing between two different models.\n\nPersonally I focus on sound, build, and battery life in that order, and if\nthere are any extra little tricks then fine its a nice little bonus but I\ndon\u2019t put a priority on them during my own buying process.\n\n* * *\n\n## The Best Bluetooth Speakers of 2020\n\n## Minirig 3.0 - Simply the best sounding portable Bluetooth speaker on the\nmarket in 2020\n\n **Features:**\n\n  * The same class-leading build quality as the Minirig 2.0 speaker\n\n  * Extremely loud and distortion-free\n\n  * Amazing bass\n\n  * Ability to link with other Bluetooth speakers to create a surround sound system\n\n  * Separate subwoofer available for the extremely loud bass\n\n![We tested all the top bluetooth speakers this year and the winner was the\nMinirig 3 because it was louder, has longer battery life and sounds best out\nof all the other portable speakers we reviewed..](https://images.squarespace-\ncdn.com/content/v1/53f35d9ce4b04d36ebb0b633/1561905201016-LPJV5Q5D7LHKQQFFY3I6/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNVbG6_RPaR1mZVFPScpo4p7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmZDfTBkIdK3ClQHQM0cs6VdfduTxTGWRJTjMAFxOHbgFxl-\nVnhpefw4dZ21zDAk_F/Best-bluetooth-speakers-Minirig)\n\nWhile I am keeping the Minirig 2.0 Bluetooth speaker listed below due to it\nstill being an excellent option at a lower price than ever I really can\u2019t\nrecommend the new 3.0 enough if your budget allows. This is the best Bluetooth\nspeaker I have ever used and it travels with me to every country I visit.\n\nFor me, it is the gold standard of portable speakers because it gets louder\nthan any others for its size and it has the ability to remain distortion-free\nwhen doing so. Its bass response is also amazing and perfect for electronic\nand rap music.\n\nBy going the route of putting a single large and very high-level diaphragm\ninside the Minirig 3.0 they are capable of producing magnificent sound. Other\nmanufacturers seem to mess about with multiple inferior and smaller drivers to\nachieve a stereo effect but it\u2019s clear this just doesn\u2019t work as well.\nMinirigs single driver is the way to go.\n\nThe other good points for the 3.0 are the outstanding 100-hour battery life\nwhich is by far the best on the test and class-leading build quality and\ndesign. The only thing we didn\u2019t like was the barrel-shaped charger, USB-C\nwould be far preferred. However, that can be forgiven as no other Bluetooth\nspeaker on the market comes close to sounding so good.\n\nThe Minirig 3 can be used in combination with a subwoofer unit and other\nMinirig speakers in a daisy-chain configuration to make them sound very loud.\nOh, and these are available in 8 different color options to match your own\nstyle.\n\n[For more information please read our full 2019 review of the Minirig 3\nspeaker.](https://www.audiophileon.com/news/minirig-3-review)\n\nVisit the [Minirig Website](https://minirigs.co.uk/speakers/bluetooth-\nminirig-3) for more details.\n\n* * *\n\n## Minirig 2.0 Bluetooth Speakers\n\n **Features:**\n\n  * Outstanding Build\n\n  * Top of the line sound\n\n  * 80 hour battery life\n\n  * Ability to daisy chain multiple Minirig speakers\n\n[ ![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511GjX8J7RL.jpg)\n](https://www.amazon.com/MINIRIG-Portable-Rechargeable-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker/dp/B00TYGAS8A?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIA3UEVTLIG7AIKFA&tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00TYGAS8A)\n\n[MINIRIG 2 Portable Rechargeable Bluetooth Speaker - 80 Hour Battery - Premium\nStereo Sound - Black](https://www.amazon.com/MINIRIG-Portable-Rechargeable-\nBluetooth-\nSpeaker/dp/B00TYGAS8A?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIA3UEVTLIG7AIKFA&tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00TYGAS8A)\n[](https://www.amazon.com/MINIRIG-Portable-Rechargeable-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker/dp/B00TYGAS8A?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIA3UEVTLIG7AIKFA&tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00TYGAS8A)\n\n  \n\nYou probably haven\u2019t heard of them before but in my mind no other speaker\ncomes close to the Minirig. This is the speaker I use on a daily basis, I\nreally cannot stress enough how good this speaker is.\n\nSo whats so good about the Minirigs? Well it wills in 4 separate categories\nwhere I believe it is head and shoulders above the competition. Firstly there\nis the sound, Rich, full, spacious and hard hitting bass it also gets very\nvery loud and remains distortion fee even when pushed to the max.\n\nSecondly build is incredible, I weigh 100kg and can stand direct on the\nspeaker and its metal chassis doesn\u2019t even squeak. Thirdly, Battery life oh\nyou thing 12 hours from JBL is decent\u2026 How about 80 hours? Absolutely insane\nand it feels like you never have to charge it. Finally Value for money, the\nMinirigs is exceptional value for money and other companies just can\u2019t\ncompete.\n\n[Read our review of the Minirig\nMini](https://www.audiophileon.com/news/minirig-mini-review)\n\n* * *\n\n## Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 2\n\n **Features**\n\n  * Stylish Design\n\n  * Waterproof\n\n  * Hanging loop\n\n  * Can be used as a stereo speaker\n\n[ ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51RqXcn7ZeL.jpg)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NFRCK7J?tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NFRCK7J?tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\nUltimate ears are one of the world\u2019s most popular consumer Bluetooth speaker\nbrands. They have a focus on creating fun and well thought out products that\nfit well into an active lifestyle.\n\nThe Wonderboom 2 is their best portable speaker to date and there are a lot of\nfeatures that make it a great travel speaker.\n\nFirstly the sound is very good. It\u2019s not as refined sounding as the Minirigs 3\nbut it does get very loud and has a nice bass response despite its small size.\n\nIt is also build to go with an excellent hard-wearing cloth exterior meaning\nit won\u2019t show up scratches like a plastic speaker and I really like the huge\nvolume control buttons on the outside.\n\nIts IPX67 rated so is waterproof and dust resistant and if will actually float\nif you throw it in the pool.\n\nAdditional bonus functions are the lanyard loop at the top so you can clip the\nspeakers to objects and you can also pair two speakers together to create a\ntrue stereo experience.\n\nBattery life was 12 hours in our test which is good but not exceptional.\nThankfully there is a fast-charge function to quickly recharge when you run\nout of juice.\n\n* * *\n\n## JBL Clip 3\n\n **Features:**\n\n  * Extremely small\n\n  * Waterproof\n\n  * Built-in carabiner clip\n\n  \n\n[ ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Y5EBf-n7L.jpg)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q6ZWMLR?tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q6ZWMLR?tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\nThe JBL Clip 3 is very similar in design to the UE Roll 2 but is much smaller\nand lighter. It isn\u2019t going to blow you away with the sound but for its size\nit\u2019s amazing and far louder than any of our smartphones,\n\nOne of the smallest speakers on this list it did impress us with a number of\ncool tricks. There is a built-in carrying clip that we thought was a gimmick\nat first but we ended up using all the time when traveling and camping. I\nfound that I would just clip it to one of the molly straps on my backpack or\nto a belt loop when without my bag.\n\nIt is waterproof with an IPX7 rating so no need to worry if it gets left\noutside. And the body is very lightweight and durable.\n\nSound is good for the size but it does start to thin out a bit in the low end.\nThe battery life wasn\u2019t great at just 10 hours playback from a single charge\nbut that is an extra 2 hours than we got in testing with the JBL Clip 2.\n\nIt\u2019s funky. It\u2019s cool. It\u2019s cheap.\n\nClick to view the official [JBL Clip 3 website](https://uk.jbl.com/bluetooth-\nspeakers/JBLCLIP3BLK.html) for more information.\n\n* * *\n\n## Bose Soundlink Micro\n\n **Features:**\n\n  * Awesome design and build\n\n  * Strong sound with decent bass\n\n  * Only 6 hour battery life is very poor\n\n[ ![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kZnJF2LBL.jpg)\n](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Micro-Bluetooth-\nspeaker/dp/B0748N1BZD?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIA3UEVTLIG7AIKFA&tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0748N1BZD)\n\n[Bose SoundLink Micro Bluetooth speaker - Black](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-\nSoundLink-Micro-Bluetooth-\nspeaker/dp/B0748N1BZD?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIA3UEVTLIG7AIKFA&tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0748N1BZD)\n[](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Micro-Bluetooth-\nspeaker/dp/B0748N1BZD?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIA3UEVTLIG7AIKFA&tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0748N1BZD)\n\nWe reviewed the Soundlink Micro in full last year and loved it. Bose put\ntogether a solid little bluetooth speaker that has better sound than the JBL\nClip 3 above and UE2 roll that was previously on this list but costs just a\nbit more.\n\nWe were big fans of the rugged rubber finish that we think will do a great job\nof keeping the Soundlink micro safe. Yet again this is another waterproof\nspeaker and just like the others, there is a hanging/carry strap to make life\na little easier.\n\nOf course, there has to be one massive let down and that is that the Bose\nSoundlink Micro only holds a total of 6 hours charge which was by one of the\npoorest we have used at any price point.\n\n[Read our full Bose Soundlink Micro\nreview](https://www.audiophileon.com/news/bose-soundlink-micro-bluetooth-\nspeaker-review)\n\n* * *\n\n## JBL Go 2 - Cheap and loud\n\n **Features:**\n\n  * Good sound\n\n  * Very good value for money\n\n  * Battery life is bordering on unacceptable\n\n[ ![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61b6A0EOWmL.jpg)\n](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Portable-Bluetooth-Waterproof-\nSpeaker/dp/B07CZ4XQ5H?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIA3UEVTLIG7AIKFA&tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07CZ4XQ5H)\n\n[JBL GO 2 Portable Bluetooth Waterproof Speaker\n(Navy)](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Portable-Bluetooth-Waterproof-\nSpeaker/dp/B07CZ4XQ5H?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIA3UEVTLIG7AIKFA&tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07CZ4XQ5H)\n[](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Portable-Bluetooth-Waterproof-\nSpeaker/dp/B07CZ4XQ5H?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIA3UEVTLIG7AIKFA&tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07CZ4XQ5H)\n\nThe JBL Go 2 is one of the best value speakers on the list because for the\nprice it was extremely hard to find fault with it. However, just like the Bose\nSoundlink it suffers from woefully poor battery life. 5 hours of music is all\nyou get from a single charge.\n\nThat\u2019s a shame because the sound and build are really befitting of a much more\nexpensive speaker.\n\nStill a good buy if you are on a tight budget as it has good sound and is\ncapable of pushing volume quite loud without distortion.\n\n* * *\n\n## Bang & Olufsen Beoplay A1 (2nd Generation)\n\n **Features**\n\n  * Gorgeous design\n\n  * Top of the line sound quality\n\n  * Very expensive\n\n  * IPX7 Waterproofing\n\n[ ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51aetineSLL.jpg)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DO9KW38?tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DO9KW38?tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\nBang & Olufsen are a premier speaker maker so its no surprise that their\nportable travel speakers inherit that eye-watering price tag of a premium\nproduct.\n\nHowever, it does show in the design as the Beoplay A1 is the best looking\nspeaker on our test by far.\n\nSound is incredibly impressive thanks to its ability to throw music in every\ndirection and this thing gets very loud without distortion.\n\nBattery life when played at moderate levels will easily exceed 20 hours which\nmakes the A1 our second-best performer on this list.\n\nOne thing that was really missing from the first generation Beoplay A1 was the\ninclusion of waterproofing and dust resistance. The biggest upgrade on this\nnew 2nd gen model is the IPX7 rating which now makes it a true travel speaker\ncapable of being used anywhere.\n\n[ **Read our full Bang & Olufsen A1 speaker\nreview.**](https://www.audiophileon.com/news/beoplay-a1-speaker-review)\n\n* * *\n\n## House of Marley Chanti Mini\n\n **Features:**\n\n  * Beautiful housing\n\n  * Splash resistant\n\n  * Good bass\n\n[ ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41TStQfBTNL.jpg)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DKGP2R6?tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DKGP2R6?tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\nThe House of Marley Chanti Mini is awesome because they are doing something\ndifferent with their design. The materials on the outside include metal denim\nand wood and I have to admit I was charmed by it.\n\nSound is also very good although lacking in out and out volume. Its also not\nfully waterproof but does carry an IPX4 splash resistant rating meaning it\nshould survive some rain and spills.\n\nBattery life again is on the low end at just 6 hours although we found it did\nrecharge slightly faster than other models on test.\n\n* * *\n\n## JBL Boombox 2 - The beast\n\n **Features:**\n\n  * A full-size portable sound system\n\n  * Great sound for a wireless speaker\n\n  * Waterproof\n\n  * Extreme Bass\n\n[ ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31y7wPLAmQL.jpg)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086C14ZPY?tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086C14ZPY?tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\nIf you really want to have a portable speaker that gives a huge sound then the\nBoombox 2 is the way to go. Taking inspiration from the 80s boombox concept\nthe JBL is a big beast of a speaker but with that size comes some insanely\nloud sound.\n\nThe unit is a full-size speaker and comes with a whopping 24 hours of battery\nlife. DOn\u2019t worry if it gets left outside after the party has finished as like\nthe other speakers on this list it is also waterproof.\n\nNot content to be a beast of a speaker with the best bass on our test it also\nhas a couple of tricks up its sleeve. You can use the JBL Boombox 2 as an\nexternal power supply for your phone and it can be hot-linked to other\nspeakers to create a surround sound system.\n\n* * *\n\n## Muve Acoustics Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\n **Features:**\n\n  * Cheap and good quality\n\n  * Hanging loop\n\n  * 3.5mm input jack point\n\n[ ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51jiW-V-WdL.jpg)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N45IF6N?tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N45IF6N?tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\nThe MuveAcoustics Bluetooth speaker is a cheap yet cheerful offering that\nshows you don\u2019t always have to pay out for a big name.\n\nFor the most part, this has all the features of the UE roll but a little bit\nless definition and bass in the sound department.\n\nStill, for under $20, this is an absolute steal and we really liked the build\nquality and hard volume control function.\n\n* * *\n\n## Anker Soundcore 2\n\n **Features:**\n\n  * Some of the best sound under $50\n\n  * IPX5 outdoor certified\n\n  * Amazing battery life (24 hours rated)\n\n[ ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31-9ghq8FFL.jpg)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTB55WH?tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTB55WH?tag=sa0a83-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\nThe Anker Soundcore 2 is an incredibly popular travel speaker because really\nit can do hardly anything wrong.\n\nIts price is spot on and makes a lot of the big name speaker companies look\npretty foolish.\n\nYou get mammoth battery life of 24 hours and IPX5 waterproof certification\nthat keeps both water and dust at bay.\n\nSound is loud and clear and the bass actually has some depth to it unlike the\noften tinny rattle at around this price.\n\n  \n  \n\n* * *\n\nFeatured\n\n[ ](/news/mangird-tea-review)\n\n[News](/news?category=News), [Earphone\nReviews](/news?category=Earphone+Reviews)\n\n[Mangird Tea Review -
