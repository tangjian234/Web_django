I bought the [Bose Soundlink Mini\nII](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZRFI5C?tag=nerdcamping-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Bose Soundlink Mini II\") four years ago, and now I don\u2019t go anywhere without\nit, and I especially love it when camping. Excellent battery life, wireless,\nportable, and fantastic sound have made it one of my favorite purchases in the\npast years. I also use it connected to my TV in my camper.\n\n **See Also:[Keep Your Speaker Charged With A Power\nBank](https://thecampingnerd.com/camping-power-banks/)**\n\nSince I bought mine, a lot of new Bluetooth speakers have entered the market,\nand today there are speakers for all budgets. Battery life has gotten even\nbetter, and a lot of them are weatherproof, even waterproof.\n\nWhat the most important factor is to you depends on how you plan on using the\nspeaker outdoors, but all of the ones I am reviewing today are rugged, great-\nsounding, and of course, wireless via Bluetooth.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what AUX or all the water-resistance ratings mean, please\nscroll down to the Frequently Asked Questions where I will answer a question\nabout this. I also answer questions about range, battery life, TV\ncapabilities, etc.\n\nBut now, let\u2019s compare and review the best portable Bluetooth speakers that\ncan be used outdoors, in the shower, or why not at home?\n\n**Table of Contents** hide\n\n1 The Best Speaker For Outdoors Is Waterproof And Rugged\n\n2 A Closer Look At Each Speaker\n\n2.1 OontZ Angle 3\n\n2.2 Anker SoundCore 2\n\n2.3 Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM\n\n2.4 JBL Flip 4\n\n2.5 Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth speaker II\n\n2.6 Bose SoundLink Revolve 360 Speaker\n\n2.7 Extra: Bose SoundLink Revolve+ 360 Speaker\n\n3 Conclusion And Recommendations\n\n4 Frequently Asked Questions\n\n4.1 How much should I spend on a Bluetooth speaker?\n\n4.2 How accurate is the advertised battery life on Bluetooth speakers?\n\n4.3 Will my Bluetooth speaker work with my TV?\n\n4.4 What is AUX?\n\n4.5 Can a Bluetooth speaker go in checked luggage on an airplane?\n\n4.6 How far will a Bluetooth speaker reach?\n\n4.7 Can a Bluetooth speaker be used while charging?\n\n4.8 Can Bluetooth speakers connect to multiple devices?\n\n4.9 IPX4, IPX5, IPX7?\n\n4.10 How do I connect my Bluetooth speaker to my laptop/computer?\n\nPreview\n\n[![OontZ Angle 3 \\(3rd Gen\\) -

Anker\nadvertises 24 hours of non-stop music! That is impressive, but it makes sense\nsince it has a 5200mAh battery. This means that you could spend several days\noutdoors and don\u2019t have to worry about charging it up. Grab it for the weekend\ntrip and play music all day and night.\n\n5200mAh is a larger battery than even your phone, so a big thumbs up to Anker\nfor daring to put a large battery in a wireless speaker, which is exactly what\nsome people are looking for.\n\n **See Also:[Best Heated Blankets](https://thecampingnerd.com/best-heated-\nblankets-camping/)**\n\nIPX5 rating, AUX input, and lightweight for what it has to offer, it makes it\na serious contender for the best Bluetooth speaker for most people.\n\nThe [Anker SoundCore\n2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTB55WH?tag=nerdcamping-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Anker SoundCore 2\") also has a built-in microphone so you can answer calls\nfrom your phone.\n\nPROS\n\n  * Lightweight\n  * 24 Hours Battery Life\n  * AUX Input\n  * IPX5 Rating\n  * Built-In Microphone\n  * Wireless via Bluetooth\n\n* * *\n\n### [Ultimate Ears\nWONDERBOOM](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XH3PWSF?tag=nerdcamping-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM\")\n\n[![Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker - Phantom\nBlack](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51RDhXlnSAL.jpg)![Ultimate Ears\nWONDERBOOM Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker - Phantom\nBlack](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20250%20250%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XH3PWSF?tag=nerdcamping-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker - Phantom\nBlack\")![](https://ir-na.amazon-\nadsystem.com/e/ir?t=nerdcamping-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B06XH3PWSF)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201%201%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n[Check Price at\nAmazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XH3PWSF?tag=nerdcamping-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Price at Amazon\")\n\nThe WONDERBOOM is a speaker that can be submerged in water and still work just\nfine with its IPX7 rating. That can be useful if you want to take your\npaddleboard out on the lake and not worry about water damage.\n\nIt also makes it a great option for a shower speaker if you like to listen to\nmusic in the shower.

The\nreason being that it\u2019s a good mix of everything. It has up to 8 hours of\nbattery life, an AUX input, a built-in microphone, and an IPX4 rating.\n\nIt\u2019s good for older people because it will tell you what it\u2019s connected to and\nthe buttons on top are easy to see.

The\nfirst one is the Bose SoundLink Revolve with a 360-degree speaker. The battery\nwill last up to 12 hours and will let you pair it together with another\nspeaker like it to create stereo sound.\n\nWhile not as water-resistant as their [Bose SoundLink\nMicro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748N1BZD?tag=nerdcamping-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Bose SoundLink Micro\"), it has an IPX4 rating.

It has a deep,\nloud and immersive sound thanks to its 360-degree speakers. If you\u2019re looking\nfor a speaker to keep in your RV that will spread your music in the RV, this\nis the best option. Note that there\u2019s also a bigger brother to this speaker\nbelow.\n\nIt has an AUX input so you can plug your phone into it directly to play music.\nThis also makes it possible to connect a TV or a computer as long as the\ndevice has a 3.5mm headphone-jack.\n\nPROS\n\n  * 12 Hours Battery Life\n  * IPX4 Rating\n  * Built-In Microphone With Voice Assistant Integration\n  * AUX Input\n  * 360-degree sound\n  * Loud\n  * Wireless via Bluetooth\n\n* * *\n\n### Extra: [Bose SoundLink Revolve+ 360\nSpeaker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCW4VFS?tag=nerdcamping-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Bose SoundLink Revolve+ 360 Speaker\")\n\n[![Bose SoundLink Revolve+ Portable and Long-Lasting Bluetooth 360 Speaker -\nTriple Black](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41WYXoitjhL.jpg)![Bose\nSoundLink Revolve+ Portable and Long-Lasting Bluetooth 360 Speaker - Triple\nBlack](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20250%20250%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCW4VFS?tag=nerdcamping-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Bose SoundLink Revolve+ Portable and Long-Lasting Bluetooth 360 Speaker -\nTriple Black\")![](https://ir-na.amazon-\nadsystem.com/e/ir?t=nerdcamping-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B06XCW4VFS)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201%201%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n[Check Price at\nAmazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCW4VFS?tag=nerdcamping-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Check Price at Amazon\")\n\nThe last speaker I am looking at today is a big brother to the Bose Revolve\nabove. This is the SoundLink Revolve+. What the plus does to it is what you\nmight expect, it makes it bigger.\n\n16 hours of battery life versus 12 on the smaller Revolve. 2 pounds instead of\n1.46 pounds.

AUX input,\nvoice assistant integration with the built-in microphone, IPX4 rating, and the\nability to connect two to create a stereo sound.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best Bluetooth speaker on the market today. If you\nput this in your RV, you will never use the built-in speakers in your RV\nagain. The portability will let you carry it around with you and put it in a\nbag when you go to the beach.

The thing I have noticed is that paying more doesn\u2019t always mean more\nfeatures, but usually better sound quality. You can pay less and get one that\nyou can take with you on the lake and last all day long, or pay more for one\nthat isn\u2019t waterproof but has better sound quality. It\u2019s all about what you\nneed.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at my recommendations.\n\n **Good:** [Anker SoundCore\n2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTB55WH?tag=nerdcamping-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Anker SoundCore 2\") \u2013 The Anker SoundCore 2 has incredible battery life,\naverage sound quality, and will let you plug your phone into it. It\u2019s an\nexcellent product for the price that will satisfy most people. With IPX5\nrating you can take it to the beach or on the camping trip without worrying\nabout damaging it. It\u2019s best in class when it comes to battery life with up to\n24 hours of playing time.\n\n **Better:** [JBL Flip\n4](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0QHI8L?tag=nerdcamping-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"JBL Flip 4\") \u2013 The Flip 4 from JBL is an impressive device with 12 hours of\nbattery life. IPX7 rating will let you submerge it entirely in water and it\ngets loud, so it works great outdoors. It\u2019s extremely rugged and is the most\nversatile speaker I have reviewed. It will do a great job not only in the\nshower and on the beach, but also at home, in the kitchen or the bedroom. It\u2019s\nversatility and great battery life is hard to beat.\n\n **Best:** [Bose SoundLink Revolve 360\nSpeaker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCQKTKR?tag=nerdcamping-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Bose SoundLink Revolve 360 Speaker\") \u2013 12 hours of battery life, Bose audio\nquality, 360-degree sound, and access to Siri and Google Now with the built-in\nmicrophone makes this portable speaker sit at the top of my list. If you want\n4 hours more battery life and a slightly bigger sound you can go with its\nbigger brother: [Bose SoundLink Revolve+ 360\nSpeaker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCW4VFS?tag=nerdcamping-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Bose SoundLink Revolve+ 360 Speaker\"). But the regular Revolve is a great\nspeaker for the price and it will be all you need in an RV when it comes to\nlistening to music or the radio. An excellent rugged camping buddy.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n###  **How much should I spend on a Bluetooth speaker?**\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, paying more doesn\u2019t always equal more features, but\noften better sound. Are you looking for a speaker to bring to the beach or one\nto enjoy your favorite music in and outside the RV? If you only plan on\nlistening in the RV, I recommend saving up and getting a better sounding one\nthan a smaller one even though it might have more features.\n\n###  **How accurate is the advertised battery life on Bluetooth speakers?**\n\nCompanies are always advertising better battery life than what is accurate. It\ndoes depend though. Playing music at higher volumes will drain the battery\nfaster and using Bluetooth, although very energy efficient it will drain more\nbattery compared to using an AUX cable. If you\u2019re outdoors camping and can\u2019t\ncharge the speaker every day you should focus more on how much battery life it\nhas than the number of features. [You can also get a portable power bank and\ncharge the speaker multiple times.](https://thecampingnerd.com/camping-power-\nbanks/)\n\n### Will my Bluetooth speaker work with my TV?\n\nIf the speaker has an AUX input, and your TV has a 3.5mm output, you can use\nthe speaker with your TV. If your TV has Bluetooth and supports wireless\nspeakers, it might also work wirelessly. You can also use a streaming box that\nhas Bluetooth built-in and choose your Bluetooth speaker as the output.\n\n###  **What is AUX?**\n\nAUX stands for auxiliary and can be found on most phones, mp3 players,\nheadphones, and in newer cars. You might have heard it been called an audio\ncable and it is the standard in today\u2019s products for audio. Apple and Google\nhave recently removed the AUX input in their phones which have caused some\nstir amongst audio fanatics.\n\n### Can a Bluetooth speaker go in checked luggage on an airplane?\n\n[Yes, you can put a speaker in your luggage and check it\nin.](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-\nscreening/whatcanibring/items/speakers)\n\n### How far will a Bluetooth speaker reach?\n\nHow far the wireless speaker will reach depends on lots of factors, but you\ncan expect it to reach at least 30 feet (9 meters), while some reach up to 100\nfeet (30 meters).\n\nThe factors that come into play are signal interference, walls, Bluetooth\nclasses, etc.\n\n### Can a Bluetooth speaker be used while charging?\n\nYes, most Bluetooth speakers can be used even while they\u2019re being charged. If\nyou\u2019re using it at home in one place, it\u2019s a good idea to leave it plugged in\nall the time to not decrease its battery capacity.\n\n![Best wireless Bluetooth speaker for outdoors indoors the camping\nnerd](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_500/https://thecampingnerd.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/bluetooth-2557525_1280-500x333.jpg)![Best wireless\nBluetooth speaker for outdoors indoors the camping\nnerd](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lqip,ret_wait,w_500,h_333/https://thecampingnerd.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/bluetooth-2557525_1280-500x333.jpg)Keep the speaker\nplugged in when you\u2019re using it at home to extend the battery capacity when\nyou\u2019re using it outdoors.\n\n### Can Bluetooth speakers connect to multiple devices?\n\nIt depends on the speaker. Bluetooth is capable of connecting several devices\nat the same time, but the speaker might have limited functionality. Check the\ndescription of the specific speaker you\u2019re looking at or look at\nquestions/answers and you should be able to get an answer.\n\n###  **IPX4, IPX5, IPX7?**\n\nThe IP in these ratings stands for Ingress Protection and is all about how\nprotected the product is from water and dust getting into it. For example,\nIPX0 means that it has no protection from water at all so taking it outdoors\nor into the shower would be a bad idea.\n\nWhen it comes to IPX4, it offers protection from a splash of water in any\ndirection for at least 5 minutes.\n\nIPX5 offers protection from a 6.3mm spray of water in any direction for at\nleast 3 minutes.\n\nIPX7 offers protection from complete water submersion up to 1 meter deep for\nat least 30 minutes.\n\nSo if you want to be in the water with your portable speaker, pick a speaker\nwith IPX7 rating as that will survive being fully submerged.\n\n### How do I connect my Bluetooth speaker to my laptop/computer?\n\nJust like with your TV, there are two ways to connect most speakers. These are\nvia an AUX cable or Bluetooth. An AUX cable fits a hole you might\u2019ve heard as\n3.5mm or headphone-jack on your phone. If your computer has one of these\nholes, and your speaker does as well, you can use a [3.5mm\ncable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NO73MUQ?tag=nerdcamping-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"3.5mm cable\").\n\nIf your computer or speaker doesn\u2019t have a 3.5mm port, and you would like to\ndo it wirelessly, you\u2019ll need a laptop or computer with Bluetooth built-in. If\nit\u2019s not built-in, you can use a [Bluetooth USB\ndongle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V1SZCY6?tag=nerdcamping-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"Bluetooth USB dongle\").\n\nFrom here, it depends on if you have Windows or Mac.
