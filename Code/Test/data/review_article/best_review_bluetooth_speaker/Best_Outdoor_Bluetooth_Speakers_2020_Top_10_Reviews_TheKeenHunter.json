Have a look below to know all the facts and features you need yo look\nfor in [speakers](https://thekeenhunter.com/home-audio/best-soundbar-\nspeakers).\n\n###  **![Best Outdoor Bluetooth\nSpeakers](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20299%20299'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Best\nOutdoor Bluetooth Speakers](https://thekeenhunter.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/Best-Outdoor-Bluetooth-Speakers-300x300.jpg)**\n\n###  **Look For Application Support:**\n\nCompanion applications offer so many additional features to a Bluetooth\nspeaker that you can\u2019t access using the physical buttons on the speaker\nitself. A companion app can allow more than one person to be DJ, create a\nplaylist, and customize EQ curves for different\n[music](https://thekeenhunter.com/home-electronics/best-bluetooth-fm-\ntransmitter) styles.\n\nWhat\u2019s more? The application can also help you to set wake up alarms, and\npower On or Off your Bluetooth speaker remotely. So, application support is\none of the useful factors that we have considered while picking up the best\noutdoor Bluetooth speakers for you.\n\n###  **Look For aptX And aptX HD Support In Best Outdoor Bluetooth Speakers**\n\nIt\u2019s necessary that the [Bluetooth\naudio](https://thekeenhunter.com/computers/best-gaming-headsets) should be\nsqueezed to stream over airwaves, and the default codec uses lossy compression\nthat throws away some portions of the musical elements. [aptX by\nQualcomm](https://www.aptx.com/) is a lossless codec, so none of the musical\ndetails get lost during the process. Also, it\u2019s necessary that the aptX should\nbe present in both Bluetooth speaker and the playback device. Apple devices\ndon\u2019t come with aptX codec, but most Android, some\n[iPhones](https://thekeenhunter.com/electronics/best-lens-for-iphone) and\ndevices support aptX codec.\n\n[Qualcomm aptX HD](https://www.aptx.com/aptx-hd) support HD audio files, but\nsadly most of the outdoor Bluetooth speakers don\u2019t support this codec. As with\nits sibling, in order to work, aptX HD must be supported on both the playback\ndevice and speaker.\n\n## Battery Life Of The Best Waterproof Wireless Speakers ** ** ![Best\nWaterproof Wireless\nSpeakers](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20502%20355'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![Best Waterproof Wireless Speakers](https://thekeenhunter.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/Best-Waterproof-Wireless-Speakers-300x212.jpg) ****\n\nWhat do you think is the most crucial feature of outdoor Bluetooth speakers?\nIs it \u201cBattery Life\u201d? Yes! Generally, we expect Bluetooth speaker [battery to\nlast 12 to 20 hours](https://thekeenhunter.com/automotive/best-portable-power-\nstations), but don\u2019t forget that the bigger the battery, the heavier the\nspeaker will be. Overall, battery life plays a significant role while choosing\nthe best outdoor Bluetooth speakers.\n\n###  **Consider The Charging Time**\n\nIf your Bluetooth speaker is equipped with a battery, you need to charge it.\nBluetooth speakers that support [USB\ncharging](https://thekeenhunter.com/computers/best-usb-c-hubs) are more\nconvenient than those supporting AC adaptors only.\n\nAlso, some speakers are there in the market that work as a [power\nbank](https://thekeenhunter.com/electronics/best-pd-power-banks) and will\nallow you to tap their battery to charge your smartphone using a USB cable.\n\n###  **Accessories And Mounting Options**\n\nMost importantly, a portable outdoor Bluetooth speaker must be easy to take\nwith you. Several outdoor Bluetooth speaker brands count on their overall size\nto make them easy to grip; there are others that come with carabiner clips,\nlanyard, and [shoulder ](https://thekeenhunter.com/health/best-neck-shoulder-\nmassagers)strap. Also, some manufacturers offer standardized sockets and\naccessories so that user can even mount their speakers to an object.\n\n###  **Speakerphone Feature Of B** **est Outdoor Speakers ![Best Outdoor\nSpeakers](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20419%20280'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![Best Outdoor Speakers](https://thekeenhunter.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/Best-Outdoor-Speakers-300x200.jpg) **\n\nSome speaker models feature built-in microphones. It allows users to use their\nspeaker as a speakerphone in concert with their smartphone. It also improves\nsound quality, and you will find it much better than what you actually get\nfrom your smartphone. Also, you will be able to [boost the\nvolume](https://thekeenhunter.com/computers/best-gaming-headsets) much higher.\nSo, It can be an excellent feature for those making conference calls with\ntheir Bluetooth speakers.\n\n###  **Stereo Pairing Feature Of B** **est Waterproof** **Wireless Speakers**\n\nStereo pairing is something that will allow you to create a [right/left\npairing with two speakers](https://thekeenhunter.com/home-audio/best-soundbar-\nspeakers). Of course, It works really best, and the sound will make you wow\nwith two identical speakers.\n\n### Weatherization Of Outdoor Bluetooth Speakers ![Outdoor Bluetooth\nSpeakers](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20314%20209'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![Outdoor Bluetooth Speakers](https://thekeenhunter.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/Outdoor-Bluetooth-Speakers-300x200.jpg)\n\nOf course, your going to take your Bluetooth speaker to outdoor and\nmanufacturers actually consider this factor while manufacturing the outdoor\nBluetooth speakers.
