This\nspeaker offers what Bose refers to as \u201croom-filling sound\u201d with the ability to\nuse Alexa-enabled smart assistance functions. That means you can both stream\nmusic wirelessly and control it with your voice. There\u2019s a small screen on the\nunit, but it just displays album artwork and is not a touchscreen \u2014 instead,\nthey've relegated the physical controls to a series of buttons on the top.\n\nBeyond the fact that it puts out big sound from such a compact device, the\nmost notable thing about the Bose Home Speaker 500 is its Alexa\nfunctionalities. (Bose promises that other smart functionality, like Google\nAssistant, is on the way.) You can use the speaker with all the requisite\nplatforms including Spotify, Amazon Music, SiriusXM and more. And there\u2019s even\na Bose Smart app that lets you pair this up with another unit or one of Bose's\nsmart soundbars to give you [multi-room sound](https://www.lifewire.com/home-\nmusic-system-overview-3134628) and mobile device control.\n\nHowever, [during our tests](https://www.lifewire.com/bose-home-\nspeaker-500-review-4693416) we found the Base app to be a bit lacking and Wi-\nFi connectivity to be a bit spotty. All told, it may be on the pricier side,\nbut the Bose Home 500 is a speaker with a notable name that gives you sound\ncommensurate with the brand\u2019s track record.\n\n[Bose Home Speaker 500 Review ](https://www.lifewire.com/bose-home-\nspeaker-500-review-4693416)\n\n_\"The Bose Music app seems to be the weakest aspect of this home stereo\nsystem.\" \u2014_[Benjamin Zeman](https://www.lifewire.com/benjamin-zeman-4688458),\nProduct Tester\n\n##  Runner-Up, Best Overall: JBL Charge 4\n\n![](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pEpOG_uzDNh4I6t0ay7YfQ4a7wU=/280x0/filters:no_upscale\\(\\):max_bytes\\(150000\\):strip_icc\\(\\)/71DW6JMyCWL._AC_SL1500_1-73c0d7e3b31c47d293beb0154b285980.jpg)\n\n5\n\n[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Portable-Waterproof-Wireless-\nBluetooth/dp/B07HKQ6YGX/?tag=aboutcom02lifewire2-20) [Buy on\nWalmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Charge-4-Portable-Waterproof-Wireless-\nBluetooth-Speaker-Black/472337782) [Buy on Best\nBuy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/jbl-charge-4-portable-bluetooth-speaker-\nmidnight-black/6291611.p?skuId=6291611)\n\nWhat We Like\n\n  * Powerful sound\n\n  * Long battery life\n\n  * Waterproof\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\n  * No mounting options\n\nThe JBL Charge 4 has some of the best battery life among Bluetooth speakers.\nThe 7500mAh battery can last up to 20 hours, although this will be more\nrealistic when using an [AUX cord](https://www.lifewire.com/difference-\nbetween-usb-and-aux-534612), rather than Bluetooth. In terms of going\nwireless, the speaker has Bluetooth 4.2 and can connect to devices up to 30\nfeet away \u2014 and that\u2019s \u201cdevices\u201d plural. JBL Connect+ allows the speaker to\nbuddy up with 100 other devices to play songs simultaneously for the ultimate\nparty, surround-sound experience \u2014 or just to keep the music going from room\nto room.\n\nOne of the JBL Charge 4\u2019s greatest claim to fame, aside from its battery life,\nis its durability. With an IPX7 rating, it is waterproof (yes, this means you\ncan take it into the shower or bath) and also floats. [Our\ntesting](https://www.lifewire.com/jbl-charge-4-review-4689325) found the\nCharge 4 to be extremely durable and handles the elements with ease. The\nsingle dual ranger speakers are paired with two bass radiators for high\nquality-sound, comparable to many \u201cstereo\u201d speakers. Flaunt your personality\nwith the JBL Charge 4\u2019s range of ten different available colors such as teal,\npink, green, yellow, blue, and red.\n\n[JBL Charge 4 Review ](https://www.lifewire.com/jbl-charge-4-review-4689325)\n\n_\"You can expect this speaker to stand up to the elements, endure heavy usage,\nand last all day._ \" \u2014 [Jeffery D.

Inside this low-profile speaker are a pair of\n4.5-inch woofers and dual amps dedicated to a set of 0.7-inch polyester dome\ntweeters. The result: room-filling sound with serious bass. And at 100-percent\nvolume, there\u2019s almost no sound vibration (a rarity for a [portable Bluetooth\nspeaker](https://www.lifewire.com/best-bluetooth-speakers-at-\nwalmart-4174733)). For even more sound, two Home Max speakers can be paired\ntogether.\n\nWeighing almost 12 pounds, the Home Max is among the heaviest of the portable\noptions. Fortunately, all that weight isn\u2019t just about the audio. The Google\nHome Max also includes Google Assistant capabilities. You can ask it to tell\nyou the weather, play a song, search the web, or control smart home devices\nlike thermostats or lights.\n\n##  Best for Design: Bang & Olufsen Beoplay A1 Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\n![](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Hs2BxtxAQAc5mo31RQTt77G5-J8=/280x0/filters:no_upscale\\(\\):max_bytes\\(150000\\):strip_icc\\(\\)/71mEmXiq7YL._AC_SL1059_1-ab5d997e8cf84067bb6068a08b3f6015.jpg)\n\n[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/PLAY-Bang-Olufsen-Bluetooth-\nMicrophone/dp/B01DO9KW38/?tag=aboutcom02lifewire2-20) [Buy on Best\nBuy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/bang-olufsen-beoplay-a1-portable-bluetooth-\nspeaker-black/5971713.p?skuId=5971713) [Buy on bang-\nolufsen.com](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/speakers/beoplay-a1)\n\nWhat We Like\n\n  * Long battery life\n\n  * Rugged design\n\n  * Excellent audio performance\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\n  * Mono audio only\n\n  * Expensive\n\n  * No navigation controls\n\nSometimes the best-designed products are almost the simplest and that\u2019s\nexactly where the Bang & Olufsen\u2019s Beoplay A1 Portable Bluetooth speaker\nknocks it out of the park. The basic circular design mimics the look of a\nhockey puck, but with strikingly clean lines that offer booming sound. With a\nbattery life that hits around 24 hours at regular music volume (recharging 2.5\nhours from zero-to-full), the 1.3-pound all-aluminum dome is both dust- and\nsplash-resistant to help protect against the elements. The sound has peak\npower of around 2X140 watts.\n\nConnection to the A1 is easily done through B&O\u2019s Play application available\non both Android and iOS (in the app you can also personalize the audio\nexperience, set up wireless stereo pairing for even bigger sound and update\nthe software on the A1). Beyond music, the A1 doubles as a speakerphone with\nan omni-directional microphone that sits on the bottom of the device and can\npick up 360 degrees of voice recognition no matter where the A1 is in relation\nto your body.\n\n##  Best Battery Life: Anker Soundcore 2\n\n![](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ZuI9zHKCtqjKBlrW-\neAQfItFOE8=/280x0/filters:no_upscale\\(\\):max_bytes\\(150000\\):strip_icc\\(\\)/AnkerSoundcore2-5c38f98346e0fb00015de7aa.jpg)\n\n[Buy on\nAmazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTB55WH/?tag=aboutcom02lifewire2-20) [Buy\non Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/soundcore-select-portable-bluetooth-\nspeaker-black/6246942.p) [Buy on\nAnker](https://www.anker.com/store/soundcore-2/A3105091)\n\nWhat We Like\n\n  * Inexpensive\n\n  * Durable\n\n  * 24-hour battery life\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\n  * Bass could be stronger\n\n  * Really not loud enough for most outdoor environments\n\nThe Anker Soundcore 2 is a surprising little Bluetooth speaker for a lot of\nreasons. First of all, its small form factor (just over six inches long and\nonly about 12 ounces) doesn\u2019t hold back the surprisingly deep and booming\n[sound quality](https://www.lifewire.com/what-to-know-about-\nbluetooth-3134591). It does lack a bit of detail, but considering it\u2019s so\nsmall, sports IPX5 waterproof, and delivers a 66-foot Bluetooth range, it\u2019s\npretty solid. But, as our category choice here denotes, the real \u201cwow\u201d factor\nis the battery life. Anker promises 24 hours of playback on a single charge \u2014\nthat\u2019s a whole day of music without the need to plug it in. Considering that\nmost other speaker options promise only 10\u201315 hours, this one blows them all\nout of the water. Plus, with a unibody design and a few sleek colors to choose\nfrom, it's pretty stylish too.\n\n[The 10 Best Speakers of 2020 ](https://www.lifewire.com/best-\nspeakers-4043413)\n\n##  Best For Bass Lovers: Ultimate Ears Hyperboom\n\n![](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TJUtlKoLtLvXeJ-\nu_KKVkphXNC8=/280x0/filters:no_upscale\\(\\):max_bytes\\(150000\\):strip_icc\\(\\)/81N1nZUjFEL._AC_SL1500_1-0a5476e3a5444cf5867cc876789e674c.jpg)\n\n[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Ears-HYPERBOOM-Bluetooth-\nResistant/dp/B07XJ8B9NV)\n\nWhat We Like\n\n  * Top-mounted controls are easy to use\n\n  * Multi-speaker setup support (using companion mobile app)\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\n  * Expensive\n\nHaving a truly thunderous sound output, Ultimate Ears' Hyperboom is a dream\ncome true for bass lovers. The powerhouse Bluetooth speaker packs in a total\nof six drivers - two precision woofers, two large passive radiators, and two\nsoft-dome tweeters - all working in tandem to deliver an audio experience that\nneeds to be heard in order to be believed. Its \"Adaptive EQ\" technology\nutilizes a built-in microphone to sense the usage environment's acoustics and\nadjust the speaker's equalizer settings automatically, enhancing the audio\noutput even further. Thanks to [Bluetooth\n5.0](https://www.lifewire.com/bluetooth-5-4160255), the Hyperboom can connect\nto two devices at a time, and has an impressive wireless range of up to 150ft.\nYou also get an optical input port and a 3.5mm audio port for wired\nconnectivity, and there's even a USB Type-A port that can be used to juice up\nother devices such as smartphones.

Despite weighing just 0.49 lbs, this diminutive thing is\ncrammed with features. It uses Bluetooth 4.1 for wireless connectivity and has\na power output of 3.3 watts. The speaker is also IPX7-rated (waterproof for 30\nminutes when submerged up to three feet deep), which is definitely a welcome\naddition, especially given the low price. Perhaps the most interesting feature\nof the Clip 3 is its integrated metal carabiner, which lets you conveniently\nhook it up just about anywhere (e.g. backpack). The integrated speakerphone\nmakes it easy to answer calls when the speaker is paired with your\n[smartphone](https://www.lifewire.com/what-makes-a-smartphone-smart-579597),\nand includes both noise and echo cancellation for improved call quality. JBL\nClip 3 comes with a 3.5mm audio port, and its 1,000mAh battery can go up to 10\nhours on a single charge.\n\n##  Best Waterproof: JBL Flip 5\n\n![](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/nxQ4CWUUCs5sXxKqdxoLCw78TZI=/280x0/filters:no_upscale\\(\\):max_bytes\\(150000\\):strip_icc\\(\\)/81Cu6K0m0L._AC_SL1500_1-44ab159d32494904b2f31ce6426bda9d.jpg)\n\n[Buy on Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/jbl-flip-5-portable-bluetooth-\nspeaker-black/6356535.p?skuId=6356535)\n\nWhat We Like\n\n  * Lightweight yet sturdy construction\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\n  * Good battery life\n\nWhen you're enjoying a poolside party, the last thing you need to worry about\nis the speaker (and hence, the music!) going kaput due to an unintended splash\nor two. And with JBL's Flip 5, you don't have to. The IPX7-certified Bluetooth\nspeaker is waterproof for 30 minutes, even when submerged up to three feet\ndeep. It features a rugged cylindrical body made up of fabric and rubber, and\ncan be used in both vertical and horizontal orientations. The Flip 5 delivers\na powerful bass output despite having a rather compact design, thanks to its\nracetrack-shaped driver. There's also support for JBL's \"PartyBoost\" feature,\nwhich lets you pair [multiple (compatible)\nspeakers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-connect-multiple-bluetooth-\nspeakers-4173788) for a bigger sound output. It includes Bluetooth 4.2 for\nwireless connectivity and comes with a [USB\nType-C](https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490) port for topping up the\ninternal battery, which can provide up to 12 hours of playtime on a single\ncharge.\n\n##  Best With LED Illumination: JBL Pulse 3\n\n![](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/64givG2zfsQ5YoMTbzkPDrJ8-iY=/280x280/filters:no_upscale\\(\\):max_bytes\\(150000\\):strip_icc\\(\\)/tech-\nsummary-list-default-image-db73eda59f544c2dba3ac6289ecbe13e.png)\n\n[Buy on\nAmazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074Q4S2NJ/?tag=aboutcom02tripsavvy2-20)\n[Buy on Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Pulse-3-Speaker/344915390)\n\nWhat We Like\n\n  * Gorgeous 360-degree lightshow sequences\n\n  * Voice assistant integration\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\n  * Micro USB charging port\n\nUndeniably one of the funkiest Bluetooth speakers available out there, JBL's\nPulse 3 looks even better than it sounds. Weighing in at 0.96 lbs, it boasts a\npower output of 20 watts. The speaker is also IPX7-waterproof for 30 minutes\nwhen submerged up to three feet deep, and even comes with [voice\nassistant](https://www.lifewire.com/virtual-assistants-4138533) functionality\nthat lets you access Siri or Google Assistant with the touch of a button.\nHowever, the biggest highlight (quite literally!) of the Pulse 3 is its\nintegrated LED array, which really takes your listening experience to the next\nlevel. These 360-degree lightshow sequences look absolutely stunning, and can\nbe extensively customized using the companion smartphone app. There's also\nsupport for JBL's \"Connect+\" technology, which can be used to wirelessly\nconnect more than a hundred (compatible) speakers and amplify the audio output\nmassively. Among other noteworthy features are a 3.5mm audio port, auto power\noff, and a speakerphone that lets you easily answer voice calls. JBL Pulse 3's\nbattery provides up to 12 hours of playback on a full charge.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nFor clarity and connectivity, it's tough to beat the Bose Home Speaker 500.\nIts smart app integration and sleek design make it the perfect choice for a\nportable Bluetooth speaker to those who can afford it. However, if you're on a\nbudget, the JBL Charge 4 is an excellent analog.\n\n##  How We Tested\n\nOur expert reviewers and editors evaluate Bluetooth speakers based on design,\nperformance, connectivity, functionality, and features.

That doesn't mean that home theater\nsystems, floor speaker sets, and the like, are not still prevalent, but\nparticularly in the last 5 years or so, the market has seen an influx in\nsleek, premium speakers that deliver amazing sound and the convenience of\nbeaming your music wirelessly from apps and phones.\n\nSomething that\u2019s interesting with the Bluetooth speaker market is that you\nwon\u2019t see quite the transparency in spec info as you will on high-end,\naudiophile products. That\u2019s for a couple reasons: First off, Bluetooth\nspeakers tend to be small(ish), contained units that often don\u2019t even feature\nmultiple drivers. Therefore, these speakers tend to have a lot of proprietary\ndigital audio processing and rely less on specs like impedance, sensitivity,\nand frequency response. In fact, many brands don\u2019t even list what those\nnumbers are\u2014a fact that would be unheard of when advertising, say, a pair of\nfloor speakers.\n\n![Bose Home Speaker 500 portable bluetooth speaker](//:0)\n\nLifewire / Benjamin Zeman\n\nWith all that in mind, there are some core considerations when purchasing\nBluetooth speakers, and oddly, this purchase has a lot more in common with\nBluetooth headphones than it does with normal consumer speakers. Because sleek\ndesign is so common, and because a small footprint is important for aesthetic\nreasons, you\u2019ll find a lot more manufacturers going in the whole home audio\ndirection, and as such, many of the best speakers offer great smartphone\nsoftware to support your system.\n\nSound quality is a factor too, of course, but you have to look at it\ndifferently, mainly relying on a brand\u2019s track record rather than the raw\nnumbers we mentioned above. Read on for a breakdown of what to consider when\nmaking the purchase.\n\n###  **Form Factor: A Competitive Space**\n\n**Design: Do They Look as Good as They Sound?**\n\nDesign\u2014what you might not initially consider a key feature in an audio\nproduct\u2014is actually really important when you look at how people use Bluetooth\nspeakers. Many of these units are meant to sit on a bookshelf or a kitchen\ncounter, giving you quick access to music, but otherwise blending in as an\nappliance would.\n\nAs such, you\u2019ll see a lot of manufacturers offering really small, futuristic\ndesigns that do away with massive, utilitarian speaker enclosures. Take a\nbrand like Bose, for instance, whose\n[SoundLink](https://www.lifewire.com/bose-soundlink-revolve-review-4693471)\nand Home series of speakers look more like a Star Wars droid than a\ntraditional speaker. Plus, if you\u2019re purchasing a battery-powered Bluetooth\nspeaker, manufacturers will often lean on sportier designs, giving you\nmultiple color options. This all makes sense considering the spirit of a\nBluetooth speaker\u2014since we\u2019re trying to do away with clunky wires and aux\ncords, why would the speaker itself be designed with a clunky aesthetic?\n\n![JBL Charge 4](//:0)\n\nLifewire / Jeffery Daniel Chadwick\n\n**Build Quality and Durability: How much ruggedness do you need?**\n\nThis category largely hinges on what your main goal is for your speaker. Are\nyou looking for something small and battery-powered to toss into a beach bag?\nOr are you looking for a more powerful at-home unit that can sit as a\ncenterpiece in your office? These two use cases imply vastly different\napproaches on the build quality front. Portable speakers tend to feature\nrugged builds, often with rubberized bumpers and shells. They\u2019ll also tend to\nthrow in IP-rated waterproofing and dust resistance. This makes these speakers\nperfect for outdoor parties and quick listening sessions on the go, but you\u2019ll\ndefinitely sacrifice some sound quality.\n\nOn the at-home side of things, build quality is part and parcel with the\ndesign conversation. Many top brands will build hybrid wood and composite\nenclosures that tend to be heavier than battery-powered speakers, but will\nstand up to years of at-home listening, even with the volume cranked. But\nthese speakers will not respond well to drops, and certainly not to the\nelements. And as far as premium constructions go, the higher end of the price\nrange will yield more finesse in the materials used, whereas one main corner\nthat budget manufacturers cut is that they\u2019ll lean on more plasticy builds.\n\n###  **Audio Quality: The Most Important Factors**\n\n**Frequency Range: How much can you hear?**\n\nAs a brief discussion in audiology 101, how high-pitched or bassy a sound is\nbased on its [frequency spectrum](https://www.lifewire.com/desktop-computer-\nspeaker-systems-3134570) (measured in [hertz and\nkilohertz](https://www.lifewire.com/story-of-hertz-megahertz-and-\ngigahertz-818308)). The human ear can hear as low as 20Hz and as high as\n20kHz, theoretically\u2014though most people\u2019s range is much narrower due to\noutside forces. Most larger speakers will cover more than the full spectrum,\nwhere some smaller speakers will cover just barely the full range.\n\nAn important note here is that just because a speaker can produce sounds as\nlow as, say, 16Hz, doesn\u2019t mean your ear can hear them. But rather, a speaker\nbeing rated to a range outside of the hearing spectrum means that the full\nhuman spectrum is covered by the speaker without it pushing its hardware to\nthe extremes.\n\nSo what does this mean for a Bluetooth speaker? Well, if the manufacturer\nlists this range, it\u2019s a good barometer of how much of the frequency spectrum\nyou\u2019ll hear, and how effective the speaker is at portraying the spectrum. But\nit\u2019s not the whole story\u2014most manufacturers in the space will include some\ndigital audio processing in the speaker to boost or cut certain parts of the\nspectrum. Bose, for instance, provides tons of detail in the low-mid part of\nthe spectrum, whereas portable speakers from brands like Anker will punch the\nbass really hard. So, even if the speaker you want doesn\u2019t list the spectrum,\nit\u2019s best to hear the speaker in person (or read a review from a reputable\nsource) before purchasing, because all sound profiles are not created equal.\n\n![Ultimate Ears Wonderboom shower speakers](//:0)\n\nLifewire / Jordan Provost\n\n**Drivers: The bigger, the bassier**\n\nAnother important factor for frequency response is the physical size of the\nspeaker cone inside the enclosure. Because there are portable and home options\nin the Bluetooth speaker category, there\u2019s a wide range of offerings in the\ndriver department. You\u2019ll find small speakers in portable units that sometimes\nmeasure just a couple inches in diameter, but you could find larger 8\u201312-inch\ncones inside larger units.\n\nIn general, the bigger a speaker is, the more capable it is at providing\nsupport and power on the bassier end of the spectrum\u2014it\u2019s why many speakers\nwill feature tiny [tweeter](https://www.lifewire.com/all-about-\nspeakers-4125129) drivers tuned to the high end of the spectrum to add sparkle\nand clarity. While a brand isn\u2019t always clear in the advertising what the\nmeasurement of a speaker is, you can get a good idea by looking at the\ndimensions of the enclosure. Just note that many speakers will employ larger,\nported enclosures to create bass-friendly echo chambers that further boost the\nlow-end.\n\n**Loudness: Don't rely too much on specs**\n\nSensitivity and impedance are likely terms you\u2019ve run across when shopping for\nspeakers, and while all sound systems rely on these factors, you shouldn\u2019t\nworry too much about the raw numbers in the Bluetooth speaker space.\n[Impedance](https://www.lifewire.com/speaker-impedance-3134705) is the amount\nof resistance a speaker supports in relation to its amplifier (measured in\nohms) and its sensitivity is more or a less a measure of its peak loudness.\n\nThese two numbers work together to indicate the power and fullness of an\namp/speaker pair. Because Bluetooth speakers feature, in almost all cases, a\nbuilt-in amp, the loudness and impedance are paired already. What\u2019s more is,\nbecause brands like Bose load in tons of processing effects, what you hear\nisn\u2019t going to match up to the raw numbers anyway. If you want a really loud\nspeaker, you can dig into these numbers, but in general, this is another\ncategory that is more important for sound systems than for wireless speakers.\n\n![Bose Home Speaker 500](//:0)\n\nLifewire / Benjamin Zeman\n\n**Bluetooth and Audio Codecs: A sound quality tradeoff**\n\nOne major oversight that people have when shopping for headphones or speakers\nis that Bluetooth, while convenient, has some inherent trade-offs with sound\nquality. That\u2019s because, by definition, the Bluetooth protocol has to compress\nthe source audio file in order to send it quickly and efficiently, wirelessly.\n\nThe most typical codecs are SBC and AAC, but these codecs compress files with\nthe most loss to the source data. This will be fine if you\u2019re just\n[streaming](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-streaming-music-2438445) MP3s\nfrom Spotify or watching YouTube videos, but if you want to stream your high\nres audio files (like WAV or [FLAC](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-flac-\naudio-format-2438548)), you\u2019d be better served with a speaker unit that\nsupports a higher-quality Bluetooth codec like [Qualcomm\u2019s\naptX](https://www.lifewire.com/aptx-bluetooth-codec-4151667).\n\n**Amps and Space Considerations: Mostly all-in-one**\n\nOne final note on amps: while speaker systems and home theater setups will\nusually center on a dedicated amp unit to power a series of multiple, passive\nspeakers, Bluetooth speakers are almost always standalone units. This means\nthe amp that the manufacturer has loaded into the speaker dictates how much\npower and control you\u2019ll get.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t find soundbars with Bluetooth functionality\nor standalone amps that have Bluetooth connectivity\u2014and both can fold into a\nlarger system. In fact, these are great ways to bring that wireless\nconvenience to an otherwise traditional home theater setup. This is largely\noverkill for most users though. Sure, if you want tons of coverage for big\nspaces and parties, they can be helpful. But most small-format Bluetooth\nspeakers are plenty loud and plenty rich, and because they often use multi-\nroom app functionality, they make for great party systems.\n\n###  **Connectivity and Software: How it all works together**\n\n**Bluetooth vs. Wi-Fi**\n\nThis is a guide specifically about [Bluetooth](https://www.lifewire.com/what-\nis-bluetooth-2377412) speakers, so we won\u2019t spend a ton of time on Wi-Fi\nspeakers, but it\u2019s an important category to consider. The biggest example here\nis Sonos. While normally, Sonos would be at the top of a wireless speaker\nlist, the brand has opted to not include Bluetooth support in any of the\nspeakers produced. That\u2019s largely because of the proprietary software system\nthat Sonos has become known for. Instead, speakers like this have to be\nconnected to a Wi-Fi network and then controlled using an app or a computer on\nthat same network.\n\nBose also offers functionality in this way, but will give you the additional\noption for Bluetooth connectivity. You\u2019ll get better lossless audio\nperformance with Wi-Fi, but it\u2019s much harder for guests to patch in and play\nmusic if they aren\u2019t already a guest on your Sonos account.\n\n![JBL Charge 4](//:0)\n\nLifewire / Jeffery Daniel Chadwick\n\n**Bluetooth Pairing and Software: Standard across the board**\n\nThe pairing process for most speakers is pretty straight-forward if you\u2019ve\never paired Bluetooth headphones to your phone. Most speakers will boot up for\nthe first time in pairing mode, but almost all speakers have a very obvious\nBluetooth pairing button. Then it\u2019s just a matter of finding the speaker in\nyour device\u2019s Bluetooth menu. Some manufacturers like Bose have developed\nmobile apps to more easily control the speakers your phone is connected to,\nwhich is nice, but these aps tend not to be as robust as the Wi-Fi speaker\napps from Sonos.\n\n**Range and Stability: How far can you wander?**\n\nThe other factor to consider is the Bluetooth version. Most speakers on the\nmarket today run on Bluetooth 4 or 5, and those two versions are more than\nadequate for in-home use. But, if you want to bring a portable speaker out to\nthe field for a picnic or larger parties, [Bluetooth\n5](https://www.lifewire.com/bluetooth-5-4160255) vastly increases the line-of-\nsight range that your speaker has. Another benefit of Bluetooth 5 is that\nyou\u2019ll get the option to tether two host devices to the same speaker, allowing\nyou to more easily switch between audio sources.\n\n###  **Portability and Battery Life: How Long Can You Listen?**\n\nWhile the high-end speakers in the Bluetooth market are almost entirely at-\nhome options, there are a ton of added benefits to going for a battery-powered\noption. The most obvious of these is that you can bring the speaker anywhere.\nThis portability brings new considerations to the table. First off, you have\nthe need for additional durability, particularly drop, dust, and water\nprotection. JBL and Anker are great brands in this regard, but Bose also\nfeatures a few rugged battery-powered options that aesthetically match the\nsporty headphones in the SoundSport line.\n\nThe other side of the portability coin is battery life. The [JBL\nCharge](https://www.lifewire.com/jbl-charge-4-review-4689325) line hovers\naround 20 hours of listening, whereas Anker and Bose have offerings just a tad\nlower. The highest battery life on the market reaches upwards of 40 or 50\nhours with products from Altec Lansing, but you\u2019ll pay a premium for this.\n\n![Bose Home Speaker 500](//:0)\n\nLifewire / Benjamin Zeman\n\n###  **Smart Speakers: An Added Layer of Functionality**\n\nWhile not exactly \u201cBluetooth speakers\u201d unto themselves, smart speakers are\nprobably the most widespread example of this product category. With most homes\nfeaturing at least one Alexa or Google Home, it begs the question\u2014do you need\nan additional Bluetooth speaker? Most of the smart speaker options will work\nfine for at-home music streaming and give you the added benefit of voice\ncontrol.\n\n[  \nApple\u2019s HomePod](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-homepod-4146975) is an\nimpressive option because the designers have taken the time to provide a truly\nimpressive sound response for a smart speaker. Beyond Apple, though, these\nspeakers tend to pale in the sound quality department. But it\u2019s also important\nto note that many Bluetooth speakers from outside brands have licensed\n[Alexa](https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107) and\n[Google Assistant](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911)\nfor their products\u2014ready to use out of the box.\n\n###  **Price: How Much Budget Do You Have?**\n\nThere is a vast range in price options, but a clear divide between small\nbattery speakers and premium home speakers. At the high end, you\u2019ll find\npremium systems from Bose, Marshall, and Bang & Olufsen that approach $1,000.\nOr, you can find budget-friendly portable speakers from JBL and Anker that\ndon\u2019t even break $100.\n\nPrice isn\u2019t always an indication of sound quality though, as there are tons of\nother features (from smart functionality to battery life to whole-home audio\nfunctions), so it\u2019s important to weigh your preferences before setting a\nbudget. If portability is your number-one priority, you can probably save a\nlot of money.\n\n###  **Popular Brands: Plenty of Choices**\n\n**Bose**\n\nThe premium audio staple Bose provides a ton of Bluetooth speakers for all\nparts of the price range. It\u2019s not surprising considering how long Bose has\nbeen focused on wireless products. Today you can pick up small battery\nspeakers, rugged canister-style units, and even full-sized stereo systems.\n\n**Sonos**\n\nWhile not strictly a Bluetooth speaker (again, please note that Sonos does\n_not_ support Bluetooth out of the box), it\u2019s hard to discuss wireless\nspeakers of any kind without mentioning Sonos. If you are okay with not having\nthe flexibility of Bluetooth, these speakers are truly impressive units for\nwhole-home audio.\n\n**Anker**\n\nThis budget brand known perhaps more for portable batteries is actually quite\na capable producer of portable Bluetooth speakers. The SoundCore series gives\nyou powerful, if bass-heavy, sound that fits right into your bag or even\nkeychains to your backpack strap.\n\n**JBL**\n\nIf you want the Anker ruggedness and portability, but would prefer a bigger\nname and notably better sound, go for the JBL Charge series that, to our ears,\nsound almost as good as an in-home system. The Clip version of the Charge\nactually lives in a carabiner-style build that easily attaches to a day pack\nor even a keychain.\n\n**Sony**\n\nSony focuses mainly on portable speakers, and they feature a ton of color\noptions like you\u2019d find on portable speakers from Bose or JBL. Sony tends to\nbe a bit pricey for what you get though, so only focus here if you have real\nbrand loyalty for Sony.\n\n**Marshall & Fender**\n\nOne interesting phenomenon that\u2019s cropped up in the last few years is the\naddition of legacy guitar brands to the Bluetooth speaker space. Both Marshall\nand Fender offer mid-to-high-end Bluetooth speakers that look and feel like\ntheir classic guitar amps. Marshall in particular offers truly high-end\noptions (like the Woburn) that will look perfectly at home next to a record\nplayer.\n\n![Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 2](//:0)\n\nLifewire / Jordan Provost\n\n###  **Accessories: Not Much Available**\n\nAccessories aren't super prevalent in this space for a couple reasons. First\noff, portable speakers tend to feature rubberized coatings, tons of protection\nfrom the elements, and even in some cases feature clips and attachments right\non the device itself. So, while there are some cases available for bigger\nbrands, you likely won\u2019t need one. On the at-home side, the main accessories\nto consider are receiver units and cables.\n\nIf you want to include your speaker as part of your larger sound system, or\nyou want to add Bluetooth functionality to a non-Bluetooth system, you\u2019ll have\nto purchase cables, adapters, and receivers. Bose, for instance, offers a\nSoundLink Bluetooth receiver that will help to link together non-Bose speakers\nusing the app. There\u2019s a lot that goes into audio cables, and seeing as this\nis a wireless speaker guide, it\u2019s sort of out of the scope of the conversation\nhere.
