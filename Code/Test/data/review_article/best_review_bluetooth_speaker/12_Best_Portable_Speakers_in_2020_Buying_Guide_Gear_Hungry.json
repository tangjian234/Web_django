For over 60 years, the JBL\nbrand has been churning out quality products with incredible consistency, and\nwith the JBL Flip 4, they have once again created a product that is worthy of\npraise. This lovely speaker comes with several features that make it such a\ngreat product to buy for yourself. The most obvious feature is the sound that\nis very special and crystal clear making it ideal for listening to your\nfavorite songs. On top of that, the sound is also great for making and\nreceiving calls. No doubt, the sound quality is incredible and there are no\nechoes when using the JBL Flip 4 which makes all the calls you make or the\nmusic you listen to, of the highest quality.\n\nOn to other grand features, the JBL Flip 4 also lets you connect up to two\nBluetooth enabled devices, allowing you and a friend to take turns in playing\nmusic from the speaker. And in terms of construction, few devices are as\ndurable as the JBL Flip 4 as it can not only handle a few scrapes and bumps,\nbut can even survive being submerged in water. Completely waterproof, the JBL\nFlip 4 is an amazing device that can be used at any time and in any location.\nWhat\u2019s more, it also has the unique JBL connect plus feature, which lets you\nhook up as many as a hundred JBL connect plus enabled speakers to amplify the\nsound; no doubt, this could be a game-changer for parties. Of all the products\non this list, the JBL Flip 4 is unarguably the best of the bunch and is a\ncomplete no-brainer to buy.\n\nKey Features:\n\nPowerful 3000mAh Li-ion battery that can last up to 12 hours\n\nJBL connect plus feature lets you connect with other JBL speakers for\nincredible sound\n\nCompletely waterproof\n\nSturdy construction that aids longevity\n\nSpecification:\n\n  * BrandJBL \n  * ModelJBLFLIP4BK\n  * Weight1.14 pounds\n\n###\n\n2\n\nOontZ Angle 3 Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\nSee More Reviews\n\n![oontz angle 3](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-\nload/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\nSee More Reviews\n\n![OontZ Angle 3 Portable Bluetooth Speaker](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-\ncontent/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\n![oontz angle 3](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-\nload/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\n![OontZ Angle 3 Portable Bluetooth Speaker](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-\ncontent/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\nCHECK PRICE ON AMAZON\n\nOur silver medal-winning Bluetooth speaker comes from Cambridge Soundworks,\nbringing a slew of killer features, all on a [super low budget](../gifts-for-\nmen-under-10/). Connecting to the Bluetooth setup is simple, with a quick\nconnection and a streamlined effort to listen to your tunes as soon as\npossible. On top of that, with [OontZ Angle 3](https://www.amazon.com/OontZ-\nAngle-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B010OYASRG/?tag=gearbeacon-20) you also\nget the least amount of bass distortion possible. Cambridge Soundworks\nunderstands that a higher volume at the cost of quality is not an option.\nNothing comes without flaws; you don\u2019t get the case that appears advertised on\nthe sales page, and the controls on the speaker themselves are a bit touchy.\nIt can take two or three presses to register, which is frustrating when you\u2019re\ndealing with the volume operations. IPX5 waterproofing and a built-in\nmicrophone for answering phone calls add a little more oomph, making this one\nof the most viable and inexpensive options for a Bluetooth speaker.

The [Bose\nSoundLink Color Bluetooth Speaker II](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-\nColor-Bluetooth-speaker/dp/B01HETFQKS/) is another product from the Bose\nstable that once more shows their incredible knack for creating such\ninnovative products. The Bose SoundLink has a soft silicone exterior which\nfeels great to the touch but also has the added advantage of being easy to\ncarry about with you wherever you go. Moving on to the features that truly\nmake it shine, the Bose SoundLink is outfitted with Bluetooth 4.2 which gives\nit vast range, and it also has an auxiliary port that lets you plug in a jack\nfor various applications.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this fantastic speaker has a voice prompt feature that eases the\nprocess of pairing the speaker with a Bluetooth-enabled device.

Blessed with 12W of volume which is enhanced by some powerful bass\nand further improved by dual neodymium drivers, you can see why this is such\nan incredible speaker to own.

JBL runs into a few issues with the bass.\nAround 75% volume, it starts to get a bit wonky, but that shouldn\u2019t be an\nissue since [Charge 3 ](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-JBLCHARGE3BLKAM-Waterproof-\nPortable-Bluetooth/dp/B01F24RHF4/?tag=gearbeacon-20)is one loud speaker. You\nget a little LED light to indicate if Bluetooth is connected, which doesn\u2019t\nalways register connections, but when it works it\u2019s a great tool. JBL supports\nmultiple speakers in the same network, so you can turn a party scene into the\nultimate outdoor space. We\u2019re also fans of hooking this up to replace a PC or\nTV soundbar, because it operates while plugged into the [AC adapter](../best-\nwall-ac-units/).\n\nKey Features:\n\nConnect multiple JBL speakers to make a surround sound experience\n\nIPX7 waterproofing\n\nTwenty-hour battery supply\n\nSpecification:\n\n  * BrandJBL\n  * ModelJBLCHARGE3BLKAM\n  * Weight1.8 pounds\n\nPros\n\nYou can hook up three smartphones at a time\n\nCan be used to replace soundbar on TV or PC\n\nCons\n\nThe bass control is weak\n\nBluetooth connection LED light doesn\u2019t always work\n\n###\n\n6\n\nAiwa Exos-9 Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\nSee More Reviews\n\n![aiwa exos-9 portable bluetooth speaker](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-\ncontent/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\nSee More Reviews\n\n![Aiwa Exos-9 Portable Bluetooth Speaker](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-\ncontent/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\n![aiwa exos-9 portable bluetooth speaker](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-\ncontent/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\n![Aiwa Exos-9 Portable Bluetooth Speaker](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-\ncontent/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\nCHECK PRICE ON AMAZON\n\nWe\u2019re going a bit bulkier for our third pick-\n[Exos-9](https://www.amazon.com/Aiwa-Exos-9-Portable-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker/dp/B00WF78GS4/?tag=gearbeacon-20), but despite the lack of mobility\nthat smaller, pill-shaped Bluetooth speakers have, it packs a serious punch.\nThe bass and volume are in perfect sync, so you get to avoid that droning buzz\nthat lower-quality speakers always flood the air with. The price is a lot\nsteeper than our first two picks, but at the cost, you\u2019re getting every\npenny\u2019s worth in features. You even get a customizable bass setting and visual\nequalizer, so you can [play your tunes](../best-noise-cancelling-headphones/),\nyour way. You get enhanced dual-coin subwoofers, and we dare you to see how\nloud those puppies can go. You also get a one-year warranty from Aiwa, but\nbased on the quality and attention to detail, users are reporting years of use\nwithout any issues. This is a perfect [gift for music lovers](../gifts-for-\nmusic-lovers/).\n\nKey Features:\n\nDual voice-coil subwoofer for improved sound operation\n\nNine hours of battery life or AC adapter power source\n\nIncludes a one-year warranty\n\nSpecification:\n\n  * BrandAiwa\n  * ModelFBA_Aiwa-9001\n  * Weight13 pounds\n\nPros\n\nCustomizable bass and graphic equalizer settings\n\nCan link up two to the same sound source + smooth listening (no buzz)\n\nCons\n\nHigh price\n\nLarger, bulkier model than standard Bluetooth speakers\n\n###\n\n7\n\nJBL Boombox Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\nSee More Reviews\n\n![jbl boombox portable bluetooth speaker](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-\ncontent/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\nSee More Reviews\n\n![JBL Boombox Portable Bluetooth Speaker](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-\ncontent/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\n![jbl boombox portable bluetooth speaker](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-\ncontent/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\n![JBL Boombox Portable Bluetooth Speaker](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-\ncontent/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\nCHECK PRICE ON AMAZON\n\nComing at you with another epic JBL product, only this time, with a bit more\nunder the hood. JBL pumped out a killer new-age\n[Boombox](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Boombox-Portable-Bluetooth-\nWaterproof/dp/B0759GC766/?tag=gearbeacon-20), outfitted with ultra-fast\nBluetooth receivers and an impressive 24-hour battery reserve.

Remember those days when people used to brag about\ntheir sound systems sitting in the trunk? While these won\u2019t be as massive,\nyou\u2019ll be able to boast about your capabilities and their portable, micro\nsize. Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n![Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-\ncontent/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\n##  **How We Chose Our Selection of Portable Bluetooth Speakers?**\n\nWe took a look at just about every single feature imaginable and cross-\nreferenced customer reviews, Gear Hungry reader reviews, and our own personal\naccounts. Based on the following criteria, we came to a conclusion on the\nlist.\n\n  * Each spec of the audio quality\n  * Bass features (tested at all volumes)\n  * Size and weight for portability\n  * Battery life during personal use vs. what the manufacturer said\n  * Waterproof capabilities\n  * Overall cost and value\n  * Aesthetics and overall practicality of the design\n  * If they work while charging\n  * Overall range\n  * Ease of connectivity\n  * Life expectancy\n\nWe\u2019ll cover some of these in a broken-down fashion in our next section, giving\nyou some insight into the main attributes to look for. It\u2019s all about\nfunction, and with electronics, a bit of flair never hurt anyone.\n\n##  **Features to Look for in Portable Bluetooth Speakers**\n\n ** _Audio Quality -_** This is measured in a signal to noise ratio, on a\nscale of one to one-hundred, measured in decibels. This is the more simplistic\nway to display the audio quality to consumers, because they actually measure\nit in sound control tests of wattage output, an SPL level, and capture the\nquality a meter away. Basically, a 90-100 decibel radio is ultra high quality.\n\n ** _USB Charging -_** Most of these devices are going to outlast the battery\non your smartphone or tablet. Having a USB plug-in option to piggyback off of\nthe main power supply, in order to keep your device running and the music\nflowing, is basically a necessity.\n\n ** _Volume Capability -_** Better volume doesn\u2019t always mean better sound;\nit\u2019s all about the audio quality corresponding to the volume level in a proper\nway. If you have a high audio quality, you\u2019ll be able to boost the volume and\nstill enjoy crisp, clear quality sound. If you\u2019re going to host the party, a\nhigher volume limit is definitely in order.\n\n ** _Battery Life -_** Nobody\u2019s ever heard of a good party only lasting for\ntwo hours. Your battery life matters immensely, but if you forget to charge\nthe battery, having the ability to play while charging is an added benefit.\n\n ** _Size -_** These days, it\u2019s not about the size of the audio equipment,\nit\u2019s about the capabilities. Size is all based on preference, and how much\nyou\u2019re willing to drag around. Most portable Bluetooth speakers are going to\nbe between one and two pounds, and rarely more than that. We also recommend\nBluetooth speakers for creating a little more fun at [the\ncampsite](https://www.gearhungry.com/best-large-camping-tents/); lower weight\nis better for everybody.\n\n ** _Waterproofing -_** The best things in life are waterproofed. You can use\nthese in the bathroom while you\u2019re bathing, or have it by the pool without\nworrying about splashes (keep in mind, they\u2019re not built to go underwater).\nThere are different IPX ratings on waterproofing, which we\u2019ll discuss further\ninto the guide.\n\n ** _Design -_** Two words dictate how we arrange and test products here on\nGear Hungry: function, and flair. If you\u2019re getting a highly-functional device\nthat\u2019s well worth the money, you shouldn\u2019t have to glare at an eyesore. We\nthrew design into the mix of reasons why we picked this list, and so should\nyou.\n\n ** _Wireless Range -_** Your speaker has to move wherever the party does.\nMost Bluetooth speakers have a fair range away from your device, but if you\ndon\u2019t want to sacrifice access to your phone to display your tunes (especially\nif you\u2019re using a streaming service or YouTube, where you can\u2019t exit the app\nand keep the music playing), you\u2019ll need a higher range. If you\u2019re at your\nhouse, connecting your speaker to your PC or laptop that\u2019s inside the house\ncan be a viable option, but it all rests on a reliable signal strength and\nwireless range.\n\n ** _Price -_** Price is a factor in everything you do. No matter which way\nyou slice it, you\u2019re going to save a hefty chunk of change by opting for a\nportable Bluetooth speaker over a large sound system. We have a fairly diverse\nselection of prices on our list, each with their own benefits. We believe you\nget what you pay for.\n\n##  **Portable Bluetooth Speaker FAQ**\n\n###  **Q: Why do You Need a Portable Bluetooth Speaker?**\n\nA: Everybody enjoys tunes; they keep the party alive, your mood mellow, and a\ncomfortable environment at a party. These are just a handful of the occasions\nand locations we\u2019ve used these portable Bluetooth speakers, giving you a bit\nof inspiration, and a goal in mind for your purchase.\n\n ** _Hiking Trip -_** As much as you want to, you can\u2019t hike the whole time.\nWhen it\u2019s time to take a rest and put up the blow-up tent for the night, it\u2019s\nalso time to put on some calming music and just enjoy your stress-free day out\n[in the wilderness](https://www.gearhungry.com/best-bug-out-bags/). If you\u2019re\ngoing [couples camping](https://www.gearhungry.com/best-double-sleeping-\nbags/), it\u2019s also the perfect way to set the mood to rekindle a missed\nconnection.\n\n ** _Outside by the Pool -_** Lounging or doing Olympic laps, some rocking\ntunes can put the wind in your sails, or allow you to work on that tan. Who\nsays you can\u2019t multitask?\n\n ** _The Gym -_** In case you didn\u2019t know, we're big advocates for getting\n[your own home gym equipment](https://www.gearhungry.com/best-home-gym-\nequipment/) and making the perfect atmosphere [to work out\nin](https://www.gearhungry.com/best-workout-headphones/). Putting on some\ninspirational, motivational music can help keep your mind in the moment when\nyou\u2019re trying to rock it for that perfect six-pack. Eye of the Tiger, anyone?\n\nThese also work perfectly to keep summertime cookout festivities going well\ninto the night. Silence is the secret assassin of get-togethers, whether it\u2019s\na lofty shindig, house party, or just grilling and letting the sun cascade\ndown.\n\n###  **Q: How to Pair and Connect Speakers with a Bluetooth Device**\n\nA: Technically, you\u2019ll be pairing the speaker with your device. First thing\u2019s\nfirst; you have to make it discoverable. Next, you have to go into your\ndevice\u2019s Bluetooth settings. Unless you\u2019re in a densely populated apartment\nbuilding, you should have no problem locating the speaker\u2019s name. Just to be\nsafe, look at the paper insert that comes with your new speaker, and find the\nunique identifier number to pinpoint where your speaker is in the dropdown\nlist of options when you flick Bluetooth on.\n\nInstructions may appear on-screen, depending on which brand you go with. Some\nof them (none on our list) may opt for you to register the product now. You\u2019ll\nnow match your Bluetooth device (which is searched) to the speaker (which is\nwaiting to receive a signal). You\u2019ll get a visual and/or audible notification,\nstating that you\u2019ve successfully paired your devices.\n\n###  **Q: Does a Bluetooth Speaker Drain my Parent Device Battery Faster?**\n\nA: If your phone or tablet, or whatever you\u2019re using, has a lock screen, just\nbe sure to keep it locked while your tunes are playing. It\u2019s going to use the\nsame amount of battery as if you were attached to a Bluetooth headset. In\ngeneral, if you play music on a device through its own speaker, it\u2019s going to\ntake up a little less battery than if you\u2019re using Bluetooth; that\u2019s not\nexclusive to Bluetooth speakers. Your device has a Bluetooth receiver, and it\ntakes power to operate. If the Bluetooth setting on your device is on, it\u2019ll\nuse a little more battery, period.\n\n![Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-\ncontent/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\n##  **Understanding the Difference in IPX Waterproof Ratings for Your\nBluetooth Speaker**\n\nWaterproofing is great, but it\u2019s good to know exactly what your waterproof\nrating can handle. There are different grades, measured in IPX ratings, as\nfollows:\n\n  *  **IPX0:** You won\u2019t see this displayed from advertisers or manufacturers, because this boasts absolutely zero protection from water. Your device _will_ get damaged and possibly destroyed.\n  *  **IPX1:** Protection from drops of water (not rain) for five minutes.\n  *  **IPX2:** Able to take trickle-sized splashes of water, needs to be dried immediately.\n  *  **IPX3:** As long as your item is upright, it\u2019ll withstand very light splashes for a minute or two.\n  *  **IPX4:** Protects against one or two light splashes of water, for no longer than three minutes.\n  *  **IPX5:** Withstands a minimal amount of sprayed water for a short amount of time.\n  *  **IPX6:** Withstands light sprays of water for a small amount of time.\n  *  **IPX7:** On average, your device will last for up to a half-hour between two and three feet of submersion.\n  *  **IPX8:** These blend into manufacturer specifics. Usually, you\u2019ll get some sort of a system where they measure a certain amount of feet underwater that it can handle, but only for a certain number of minutes.\n\n![Jordan Carter](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-\nload/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\nJordan Carter\n\nJordan Carter is Gear Hungry's resident Editor-in-Chief with a genuine love\nand passion for all things tech.
