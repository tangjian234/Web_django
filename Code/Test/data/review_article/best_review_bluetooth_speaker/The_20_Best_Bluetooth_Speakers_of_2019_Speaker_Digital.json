Let\u2019s dive right in with our top eight picks now.\n\n##  Best Home Audio Bluetooth Speaker\n\n* * *\n\n###  Peachtree Audio DEEPBLUE2 Bluetooth Powered Speaker\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a speaker that pumps out powerful audio sound capable of\nfilling your rooms with your favorite music, there\u2019s no better option than the\nPeachtree Audio DEEPBLUE2. This Speaker has five speaker drivers that create a\ndeep rich sound covering the full range of human hearing. You\u2019ll experience\nall the high notes as well as all of the bass notes \u2013 so no matter which type\nof music you listen to this speaker will satisfy your home audio needs.\n\n####  Easy Bluetooth Connectivity\n\nThe DEEPBLUE2 connects easily with your smart device using a simple button on\nthe top of the unit. There are no extra pins or passwords that need to be\nentered \u2013 you simply have to activate it on your Bluetooth-enabled smart\ndevice. I\u2019m a big fan of simplicity, so this definitely works.\n\n####  Backwards Compatible\n\nSometimes you still want to connect an older audio device with your new\nBluetooth speaker and that\u2019s entirely possible with this model. On the back of\nthe unit is a 3.5 mm Aux-in port which will connect to older devices such as\nearlier iPod models and record players. There is no need to leave your old\nmusic collection behind.\n\n* * *\n\n![](http://www.speakerdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Peachtree-3M.jpg)\n\n[__Check Price on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Peachtree-Audio-\nDEEPBLUE2-Bluetooth-Powered/dp/B00THKVQDO/?tag=speakers0d5-20)\n\n[Full Review](http://www.speakerdigital.com/uncategorized/peachtree-audio/)\n\n##  Best Bluetooth Speaker under $200\n\n* * *\n\n###  Creative Sound Blaster Roar 2 Bluetooth Speaker\n\nWith the Creative Sound Blaster Roar 2 you don\u2019t have to break the bank to\nexperience great portable audio. This Speaker can be purchased for under $200\nand has a great rich sound that you\u2019d expect to find in a much more expensive\nstereo system. If you want to control your spending but still have the best\nmusic option available, then this is a great choice.\n\n####  Rechargeable Convenience\n\nThis speaker has a built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery that gives you\nthe freedom to take it with you anywhere you go. In a world where we\u2019re always\non the go we don\u2019t want a stereo system that will tie us down to one place,\nwhich makes the Roar 2 an ideal choice. As long as you charge it in advance of\nyour next outing you\u2019ll get hours of listening pleasure before you have to\nrecharge it again.\n\n####  Built-In SD Card\n\nWhen it comes to your musical collection you have a lot of different options\nfor how you might listen to this speaker. As with any other Bluetooth speaker\nyou can connect your smart device to it and listen to your collection found on\nthat device, but it also has a built-in SD card which you can load up with\nyour favorite music and leave in the device, freeing up your smart phone or\ntablet for other activities.\n\n* * *\n\n![](http://www.speakerdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Creative-5M2.jpg)\n\n[__Check Price on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Creative-Blaster-Portable-\nBluetooth-Speaker/dp/B00W8O6MJO/?tag=speakers0d5-20)\n\n[Full Review](http://www.speakerdigital.com/uncategorized/creative-sound-\nblaster/)\n\n##  Best Speaker for an Outdoor Barbecue\n\n* * *\n\n###  Harman-Kardon Onyx Studio 2 Wireless Speaker System\n\nIf your main concern when purchasing a Bluetooth speaker is finding the best\noption with great quality sound, the Harman-Kardon Onyx Studio 2 definitely\nfits the bill. There\u2019s nothing flashy about this speaker, but it\u2019s well-\ndesigned and produces a balanced distribution of sound which will fill any\narea with the sound of your favorite melodies \u2013 even a backyard barbecue.\n\n####  Advanced Audio\n\nIn reality this speaker only produces about 15 watts of power, but through the\nuse of some advanced technological tricks it will sound to the ear like 60\nwatts as it distributes that sound over four separate channels. Personally,\nI\u2019m not too concerned with how the technology works as long as it does, and if\nthis speaker can produce sound that for all intents and purposes is this\npowerful, it\u2019s good enough for me.\n\n####  Speakerphone Capability\n\nWhen your phone rings and there is music blaring in the background it can be a\nlittle annoying, so this speaker has a built-in mike that allows it to double\nas a speakerphone. When you hit the button to accept a call the music is\nautomatically cut off and the speakerphone takes over. If you\u2019re in the middle\nof a party your guests might not be too satisfied, but it\u2019s a great option if\nyou\u2019re listening to music by yourself.\n\n![](http://www.speakerdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Harmon-1M2.jpg)\n\n[__Check Price on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Harman-Kardon-Wireless-\nRechargeable-Microphone/dp/B00ZGVTSM4/?tag=speakers0d5-20)\n\n[Full Review](http://www.speakerdigital.com/uncategorized/harman-kardon-onyx/)\n\n##  Best Speaker for Pairing  \nwith Multiple Speakers\n\n* * *\n\n###  UE BOOM 2 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker\n\nIf you really want to take the party to the next level it\u2019s a great idea to\nhave an audio system with multiple speakers but, unfortunately, most of the\nBluetooth speakers on the market today don\u2019t afford you that option. One that\ndoes is the UE BOOM 2. You can pair more than one of these speakers together\nin order to create a richer stereo sound that will fill any room or outdoor\nevent.\n\n####  360 Degrees of Sound\n\nThis speaker has a unique design that allows it to distribute the sound\nemanating from it in 360 degrees \u2013 which means no matter where you\u2019re standing\nin a room you\u2019ll experience the same quality of sound as anybody else. While\nspeaker systems that project the sound in one direction are okay, it can be a\nlittle frustrating having to turn your speakers around when you move around\nthe room. With a setup like this you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\n\n#### Water Is Not a Problem\n\nThe other big selling point of this speaker system is that it\u2019s completely\nwaterproof. There are quite a few speakers on the market that are water\nresistant, but they can\u2019t handle being submerged in water \u2013 this one can. You\nprobably won\u2019t want to go swimming with it tied to your shorts, but if it\nhappens to fall in the shallow end of the pool it will more than likely keep\nplaying on.\n\n* * *\n\n![](http://www.speakerdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/UE-Boom-3M.jpg)\n\n[__Check Price on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/UE-BOOM-Wireless-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker/dp/B014M8ZO8S/?tag=speakers0d5-20)\n\n[Full Review](http://www.speakerdigital.com/uncategorized/ue-boom/)\n\n##  Best Splashproof Bluetooth Speaker\n\n* * *\n\n###  JBL Pulse 2 Portable Splashproof Bluetooth Speaker\n\nThere\u2019s nothing more annoying than having to run inside when you\u2019re enjoying a\nnice day on the patio because of a little sun shower in order to protect your\nspeaker system \u2013 that\u2019s not necessary with the JBL Pulse 2 as this speaker is\nsplashproof. It\u2019s not designed to handle being fully submerged, but that quick\nsummer storm shouldn\u2019t pose any problems.\n\n####  A Little Light Show\n\nA feature of this speaker that really caught my attention was its built-in\nlight show. It actually has lights that react to the sound waves from your\nspeaker and flash in time to the rhythm. It also has a prism color lens that\nallows you to control which colors take center stage. In essence you can\nbecome the director of your own backyard concert with a full light show.\n\n####  Respectable Battery Life\n\nThis is another speaker with a great rechargeable battery. On one charge you\ncan expect the battery to last for about 10 hours at mid-range levels. If you\nprefer to listen to music cranked up to full volume you\u2019re likely to still get\nat least eight hours of listening time on one charge.\n\n![](http://www.speakerdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/JBL-Pulse-1M.jpg)\n\n[__Check Price on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/JBL-Portable-Splashproof-\nBluetooth-Speaker/dp/B0147K6UDO/?tag=speakers0d5-20)\n\n[Full Review](http://www.speakerdigital.com/uncategorized/jbl-pulse/)\n\n* * *\n\n##  Best Speaker with Built-in Equalizer\n\n* * *\n\n###  Aiwa Exos-9 Bluetooth Speaker\n\nIf you like to have full control of the sound that your speaker produces\nyou\u2019ll definitely want to look for a speaker with a built in equalizer, and\nthe Aiwa Exos-9 has you covered in this respect. This speaker system allows\nyou full control of both treble and bass; it doesn\u2019t hurt that it has about\n200 watts either! If you like powerful, controlled sound this is perfect for\nyou.\n\n####  Great Range\n\nBluetooth technology is somewhat limited in its range, so no matter which\nsystem you choose you won\u2019t be able to walk a couple hundred feet away and\nstill get the same quality of sound. If you want to get the most out of your\nspeaker\u2019s range, though, that\u2019s another great reason to choose this model. It\nhas a range of up to 50 feet \u2013 which is far superior to most other Bluetooth\nspeakers on the market.\n\n####  Driving Bass\n\nAlong with two tweeters and two midrange drivers, this speaker also has a\npowerful subwoofer for that pounding bass sound that\u2019s essential for some\ngreat rock tracks that you probably have in your library. There\u2019s nothing like\na pounding bass rhythm to get your party rolling and this is a speaker system\nthat can set you on your way.\n\n* * *\n\n![](http://www.speakerdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Aiwa-6M.jpg)\n\n[__Check Price on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Aiwa-\nAiwa-9001-Exos-9-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B00WF78GS4/?tag=speakers0d5-20)\n\n[Full Review](http://www.speakerdigital.com/uncategorized/aiwa-exos/)\n\n##  Best Speaker with  \nLong-Lasting Battery\n\n* * *\n\n###  Jawbone BIG JAMBOX Wireless Bluetooth Speaker\n\nIf long-lasting battery power is one of your primary concerns then you can do\na lot worse than the Jawbone BIG JAMBOX. This speaker has a battery that will\nlast up to 15 hours \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of listening time! There may be the odd\ntime when this might not quite get you through the day, but I\u2019m sure the days\nwhen any of us are listening to our music for 15 hours consecutively are few\nand far between.\n\n####  3-D Sound\n\nThis model has a big advantage over its competition because of a technology\ncalled LiveAudio \u2013 this actually allows the speaker to produce music with a\n3-D quality to it. No matter where you\u2019re standing in the room you\u2019ll feel\nfully immersed in the sound. It\u2019s the type of feature that you simply have to\nhear to appreciate how impressive it is.\n\n####  Easy Updates\n\nNo matter how good a speaker is, eventually it will become a little outdated\nand with this in mind the Jawbone BIG JAMBOX allows you to connect with its\nwebsite via a USB port connected to your smart device, to download the latest\nupdates to its software. This allows you the advantage of having access to any\nimprovements they\u2019ve made since you purchased your speaker.\n\n* * *\n\n![](http://www.speakerdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jawbone-1M2.jpg)\n\n[__Check Price on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Jawbone-JAMBOX-Wireless-\nBluetooth-Speaker/dp/B006AXRR3Y/?tag=speakers0d5-20)\n\n[Full Review](http://www.speakerdigital.com/uncategorized/jawbone/)\n\n##  Best NFC Technology Speaker\n\n* * *\n\n###  Sony SRSX55/BLK Powerful Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\nI\u2019ve owned a lot of Sony products over the years and I\u2019ve never been\ndisappointed with the quality of their offerings. One thing Sony always does\nwell is to include the latest technologies and they\u2019ve continued that\ntradition with the SRSX55 Bluetooth speaker. This speaker has the ability to\npair with your smart phone or tablet using NFC technology. If you\u2019re not\nfamiliar with this technology, it actually allows you to tap your smart phone\non the speaker to automatically connect the two devices.\n\n####  Plenty of Power\n\nThe problem with a lot of Bluetooth speaker systems is that they simply can\u2019t\nput out enough sound to fill a large area \u2013 the Sony SRSX55 can. This speaker\nhas a system of drivers that allows it to produce 30 watts of digitally-\nenhanced sound. For most of us that\u2019s more than enough to satisfy our\nlistening pleasure.\n\n####  A Little Clarity\n\nOn occasion you\u2019ll come across an audio file that sounds a little distorted or\njust isn\u2019t up to par for some other reason. This Sony speaker has built-in\nsound boost technology that allows you to clarify the sound when you run into\nthis type of problem. It\u2019s especially useful if you\u2019re listening to an older\ntrack that needs some cleaning up.\n\n* * *\n\n![](http://www.speakerdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Sony-2M.jpg)\n\n[__Check Price on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-SRSX55-BLK-Powerful-\nBluetooth/dp/B00TTWZHBW/?tag=speakers0d5-20)\n\n[Full Review](http://www.speakerdigital.com/uncategorized/sony-srs/)\n\n* * *\n\n##  A Tough Decision\n\nIt\u2019s not easy making a decision when you have so many choices and there are\ncertainly a lot of Bluetooth speakers on the market these days.
