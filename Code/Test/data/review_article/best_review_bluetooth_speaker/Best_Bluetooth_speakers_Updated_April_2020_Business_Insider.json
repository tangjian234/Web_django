[music\nservices](https://www.businessinsider.com/best-music-streaming-service-\nsubscription) shouldn't be limited to one spot in your home, and while the\ndays of carrying around a boom box on your shoulder are by and large over, you\ncan still get a great on-the-go music playing device for you and your friends\nin the form of a Bluetooth speaker.\n\nWhether you're getting a speaker for use around the house or a day at the\npark, there's almost certainly a great Bluetooth speaker for you. But there\nare a number of things to consider before you buy.\n\n  *  **Size matters:** You'll want to think about how big you want the speaker to be. Now, speaking very generally, larger speakers will be louder, and while you can often get quite a racket out of a smaller speaker, for larger parties and gatherings, a larger speaker may be a little more appropriate. Of course, size also affects portability. If you're looking for something you can slip in your bag and carry around easily, then a smaller speaker may be a better choice for you.\n  *  **Battery life:** You'll obviously want a longer battery life if you're looking for a speaker that can last all day, but sometimes a speaker with a shorter battery lifespan will do the job \u2014 especially if you plan on being able to charge the speaker often or even while in use.\n  *  **Durability and water resistance:** Durability is another important factor if you plan on carrying the speaker around a lot. Not only will your speaker last longer if it's more durable, but it might be a little more versatile, too. For example, you probably won't want to take a non-waterproof speaker to the pool or the beach.\n  *  **Sound quality:** Some may not care too much about how a Bluetooth speaker sounds, but others will want to ensure that they're getting the best audio performance they can for their money.\n\nWe have a pick for everyone in our buying guide whether you're an audiophile\nwho's ready to spend the big bucks, a college kid on a budget, or someone\nwhose needs fall in between the two ends of the spectrum.\n\n## Here are the best Bluetooth speakers:\n\n  * Best Bluetooth speaker overall: [Sonos Move](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07W95RBZM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-bluetooth-speakers-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07W95RBZM&linkId=cef2a29d5ba88f5fc696d6552326bf8f)\n  *  **Best portable Bluetooth speaker:[Bose SoundLink Revolve+](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Revolve-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B06XCW4VFS/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-bluetooth-speakers-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=59b0c152bc41cf1699b1ae608b4aac7f&camp=1789&creative=9325) **\n  * **Best waterproof Bluetooth speaker:**[UE Boom 3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DD7ZJ6X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-bluetooth-speakers-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07DD7ZJ6X&linkId=a59c7827ccd674b8c0dc06891433a86d)\n  *  **Best cheap Bluetooth speaker:**[Anker Soundcore Flare Mini](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PPNY861/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-bluetooth-speakers-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07PPNY861&linkId=01e8a0015b322717f290e3b1dedb7604)\n  *  **Best small Bluetooth speaker:[Bang & Olufsen Beoplay P2](https://www.amazon.com/PLAY-Bang-Olufsen-Bluetooth-Microphone/dp/B06XYS8Q5X/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-bluetooth-speakers-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=b8a4a6c79e2ea76fd4e5ca6906063694&camp=1789&creative=9325)**\n  *  **Best Alexa smart speaker with Bluetooth:[Amazon Echo (3rd Gen)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R1CXKN7/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-bluetooth-speakers-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07NFTVP7P&linkId=48df75e225f7976a47cb5bde1d06acbd)**\n  *  **Best smart Bluetooth speaker with Google Assistant:[JBL Link 20](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biipgf_081417_best-bluetooth-speakers/https://www.jbl.com/voice-activated-speaker/JBL+LINK+20.html)**\n  *  **Best affordable Bluetooth speaker:[JBL Flip 4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSYQWNY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-bluetooth-speakers-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01MSYQWNY&linkId=f40a844e215d74e2fa96418e6105d4c4)**\n\n _Prices and links are current as of 04/01/2020.

The speaker offers a\nton of bass, coupled with plenty of clarity and detail in the high end. That\nmakes it excellent for listening to music. The speaker can even be calibrated\nusing Sonos' Trueplay tuning technology, though you'll want to tune it for\ndifferent environments when you move the speaker around.\n\nSpeaking of moving the speaker, that's another thing that's great about the\n[Sonos\nMove](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07W95RBZM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-\nbluetooth-\nspeakers-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07W95RBZM&linkId=cef2a29d5ba88f5fc696d6552326bf8f).\nThe speaker has a base station where you can keep it most of the time, but\nit's designed to be portable too, so you can take it outside when you have a\nBBQ or move it around the house as you need. It is a bit heavy, so you won't\nbe carrying it around on all your excursions, but it's nice to have the\noption.\n\nLike other Sonos speakers, the [Sonos\nMove](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07W95RBZM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-\nbluetooth-\nspeakers-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07W95RBZM&linkId=cef2a29d5ba88f5fc696d6552326bf8f)\nis smart too. You can choose to use either the Google Assistant or Amazon's\nAlexa, plus it integrates perfectly with Sonos' other speakers, allowing for\nmulti-room audio. The speaker has a battery life of around 10 hours so it\nshould easily get you through a day of listening when it's not being charged\non its dock.\n\nBut what about the downsides? This speaker is a little pricey, and you won't\nget access to all of the smart features when you're using it with Bluetooth.\nStill, despite those downsides, it's gotten excellent reviews from many\nexperts. [TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/sonos-move-review) gave\nthe speaker an impressive 4.5/5, while\n[CNET](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/sonos-move-review/) gave it a still\nimpressive 4/5.\n\n **Pros:** Classy design, smart features, integrates with other Sonos\nspeakers, excellent audio quality\n\n **Cons:** A little expensive, a bit heavy\n\n[ $399.99 from Best Buy\n](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsonos-\nmove-smart-portable-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-speaker-with-alexa-and-google-\nassistant-black%2F6361922.p%3FskuId%3D6361922) [ $399.00 from Amazon\n](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07W95RBZM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-\nbluetooth-\nspeakers-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07W95RBZM&linkId=cef2a29d5ba88f5fc696d6552326bf8f)\n\n## The best portable Bluetooth speaker\n\n[ ![Bose](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/598a18624fc3c0bb188b50a7?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\nBose  ](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Revolve-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker/dp/B06XCW4VFS/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-bluetooth-\nspeakers-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=59b0c152bc41cf1699b1ae608b4aac7f&camp=1789&creative=9325)\n\n### The [Bose SoundLink Revolve+](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-\nRevolve-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker/dp/B06XCW4VFS/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-bluetooth-\nspeakers-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=59b0c152bc41cf1699b1ae608b4aac7f&camp=1789&creative=9325)\nlooks great, it's easy-to-use, it offers 16 hours of battery, and it sounds\ngood, too.\n\nThere are dozens of Bluetooth speakers out there, but the best speaker you can\nbuy for moving around the house is the [Bose SoundLink\nRevolve+](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Revolve-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker/dp/B06XCW4VFS/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-bluetooth-\nspeakers-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=59b0c152bc41cf1699b1ae608b4aac7f&camp=1789&creative=9325).\nThere are a number of things that make this speaker such a nice option for\nmost people, from its great sound to its nice design.\n\nLet's start with the design of the speaker, which is really quite good. It's\nreminiscent of new smart speakers like the Amazon Echo or Google Home, so\nit'll look right at home in any tech-savvy person's house. On top of that, it\noffers extremely easy-to-use controls, with six buttons located on the top of\nthe speaker for things like volume control and Bluetooth control.

It blended right in with\nour decor, too.\n\nThe speaker even has some smart features, including Bluetooth pairing with\nvoice prompts, the ability to take calls, and access to Siri or Google\nAssistant. If you buy two speakers, you can sync them up together for party\nmode, too.\n\nThe speaker will give you 16 hours of play time, so it should get you through\nthe day very easily \u2014 especially if you're good at keeping devices charged up.\nThe 16-hour lifespan makes it good for holiday parties and when you're at the\nbeach. You won't have to worry too much about the speaker getting damaged,\neither, thanks to its water-resistant design. The speaker can handle splashes\nand other interactions with water, though we wouldn't recommend actually\ntaking it in the water with you.\n\nSo what about audio quality? Generally, it's good enough for most people's\nneeds. As any audiophile will tell you, don't expect any Bluetooth speaker to\nbeat a good wired speaker. Still, it does offer generally louder volume than\nother wireless speakers and is able to offer deep and clean bass easily\nwithout distorting.\n\nOther reviewers largely agree that this is a great speaker, too.\n[CNET](https://www.cnet.com/products/bose-soundlink-revolve-plus/review/) gave\nit 4/5 stars in its review.

This speaker may carry a budget price, but it still\nsounds decent and won't break the bank.\n\nThe speaker is designed to look a lot better than other speakers in its price\nrange. It's a cylindrical design with a fabric covering around the side and\ncontrols on the top. Those controls include power, volume, and Bluetooth\npairing. There are even LED lights on the bottom, and you can control those\nlights through five different lighting modes.\n\nThe design of the speaker plays into how it sounds too. The speaker can\ndeliver 360-degree audio, so no matter where you are around it, it should\nsound pretty good. It definitely won't sound quite as powerful as some of the\nmore expensive speakers in this price range, but it can still get pretty loud\nand offers a decent amount of bass.\n\nYou'll get 12 hours of battery life out of the speaker, which isn't bad at\nall, and it's water-resistant with an IPX7 water-resistance rating.\n\nConsidering the price range, perhaps the only real downside to the speaker is\nthat it can't really match more expensive offerings in the audio department.\n\n **Pros:** Well-designed, very inexpensive, water-resistant, good battery life\n\n **Cons:** Sound quality is only fine\n\n[ $39.99 from Amazon\n](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PPNY861/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-\nbluetooth-\nspeakers-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07PPNY861&linkId=01e8a0015b322717f290e3b1dedb7604)\n\n## The best small Bluetooth speaker\n\n[ ![bo beplay p2](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/598b709476084a26008b772a?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\nB&O  ](https://www.amazon.com/PLAY-Bang-Olufsen-Bluetooth-\nMicrophone/dp/B06XYS8Q5X/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-bluetooth-\nspeakers-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=b8a4a6c79e2ea76fd4e5ca6906063694&camp=1789&creative=9325)\n\n### The [B&O Beoplay P2](https://www.amazon.com/PLAY-Bang-Olufsen-Bluetooth-\nMicrophone/dp/B06XYS8Q5X/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipgf_081417_best-bluetooth-\nspeakers-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=b8a4a6c79e2ea76fd4e5ca6906063694&camp=1789&creative=9325)\ndoesn't just sound good and feature a slick design, it's ultra-portable, too.\n\nThe Bose and UE speakers are really nice, but they probably won't fit into\nyour bag all that easily.

That's largely thanks to its sleek and stylish design, coupled with\nhidden and intuitive controls. For example, you can double tap the speaker\ngrill to play and pause your music, or you can program the speaker through the\naccompanying app to activate your digital assistant of choice, whether it be\nGoogle Assistant or Siri. That happens through your phone because the speaker\ndoesn't have those assistants built-in.\n\nSo how does the speaker sound? You can't expect studio-quality sound, but it's\nnot bad.

It's a cylindrical design, with a\nfabric covering around the sides, a light ring at the top, and controls for\nthose like volume and muting the microphone. It's available in a few different\ncolors too, including Charcoal, Sandstone, Heather Gray, and Twilight Blue.\n\nOf course, perhaps the best thing about the Amazon Echo is the fact that it\nhas Alexa built right into it. In other words, using the speaker, you can\ncontrol smart home devices, find out information from the web, play music, and\nmore using only your voice.
