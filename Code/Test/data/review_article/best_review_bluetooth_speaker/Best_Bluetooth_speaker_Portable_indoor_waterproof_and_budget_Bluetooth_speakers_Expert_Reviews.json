In fact, it's becoming more and more common to see these\nportable powerhouses replacing their traditional siblings. Modern life demands\nflexibility in the form of lightweight audio devices that work seamlessly with\nyour smartphone.\n\nA good Bluetooth speaker will be small, but powerful enough to fill a room\nwith sound. Many models are totally wireless, but most come with power leads\nfor when the nearest plug socket is conveniently close. Those that rely upon a\nconstant mains connection are heftier but will sound better for it.\n\nSome are completely waterproof, and others have built-in microphones so you\ncan talk to Siri or Google Assistant. High-end models might even charge your\nphone wirelessly, or use clever technology to adjust the EQ to match the room.\n\nIf this seems overwhelming, don't worry: below, we'll run you through the\nthings you need to consider before buying a Bluetooth speaker in more depth.\nIf you feel like you already know enough on the topic, however, feel free to\nuse the following link to jump straight to our pick of the best Bluetooth\nspeakers to buy.\n\n **Skip to products**\n\n![](https://cdn2.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/files/styles/large/public/2018/02/best_bluetooth_speakers_-\n_orbitsound_the_dock_e30.png?itok=EKG4IzB8)\n\n#### [Save over \u00a3200 on the Dock E30](https://www.orbitsound.com/en-\ngb/products/dock-e30/)\n\nOrbitsound's Dock E30 combines a gorgeous wooden design and exceptional audio.\nIt's a great Bluetooth speaker at full price: at almost half price, it's an\nabsolute bargain!\n\nOrbitsound\n\nWas \u00a3449\n\nNow \u00a3225\n\n[Buy Now](https://www.orbitsound.com/en-gb/products/dock-e30/)\n\n### How to choose the best Bluetooth speaker for you\n\n#### What is Bluetooth?\n\nBluetooth is a wireless technology standard that allows communication over\nshort distances. Nowadays, Bluetooth technology has gone through a number of\nrevisions, is more reliable than ever and can carry enough data for high-\nquality music. As such, Bluetooth speakers have risen in popularity.\n\nEvery phone and tablet will have support for Bluetooth, as will most laptops.\nOtherwise, an inexpensive USB Bluetooth dongle can add support. These will let\nyou connect your music source of choice to your Bluetooth speaker \u2013 whether\nit's a CD in your laptop's drive, a locally stored MP3 file or streamed music\nfrom the internet, such as BBC Radio via iPlayer or the latest songs on\nSpotify.\n\nSee related\n\n[Best PC speakers 2020: The best computer audio for gaming and music](/tvs-\nentertainment/1405463/best-pc-desktop-speakers-uk)\n\n[Best Bluetooth headphones 2020: The finest wireless in-ear, on-ear and over-\near headphones to buy in the UK](/headphones/1405124/best-bluetooth-\nheadphones-the-best-wireless-in-ear-on-ear-and-over-ear)\n\nWhen it comes to different kinds of Bluetooth and codecs, it's worth keeping\nan eye out for Bluetooth aptX support. The aptX codec is usually only\nsupported on more expensive Bluetooth speakers due to the licensing cost, but\nit allows for a higher-quality transmission, resulting in CD-quality songs\nwithout any loss of detail.\n\nPairing a Bluetooth device is straightforward: you'll just need to put the\nspeaker into pairing mode and search for the speaker on your device.\nOtherwise, near-field communication (NFC) can let you pair your device to an\nNFC-compatible speaker simply by touching the two together, automating the\nentire process.\n\n#### Fixed or portable?\n\nIf you're looking for a Bluetooth speaker you can carry around, you'll want\none with a built-in battery. Any Bluetooth speaker worth its salt will usually\nlast upwards of at least eight hours and some will go into double figures.\nMost speakers will charge over a micro-USB cable, which is handy as you can\noften get by only carrying one charger for your smartphone, tablet and\nBluetooth speaker (unless you're an Apple device owner). Certain Bluetooth\nspeakers aren't designed for moving around, meaning they don't have a battery\nand will instead need to be plugged into your mains. What these lack in\nportability they should make up with fuller and richer sound.\n\n#### Ruggedised and waterproof\n\nBluetooth speakers make great holiday or outdoor companions. You can find\nwaterproof and ruggedised models that are ideal to take beside the pool, or on\noutdoor adventures, without worrying about them getting damaged. The rugged\nmodels will have shock-proofing, meaning they can handle occasionally being\nthrown around or dropped. Where it comes to water resistance, be sure to check\nthe IPX rating as that will tell you to what extent it can survive exposure to\nwater. Some waterproof models will have IPX7, meaning they can survive being\nsubmerged in up to a metre of water for at least 30 minutes. Less waterproof\nmodels might only be IPX4-rated and so can only handle a splash.\n\n#### Speaker drivers\n\nAs Bluetooth speakers vary widely in size, they can have vastly different\nnumbers of drivers inside. The smaller speakers may only have two drivers, but\nthe larger ones can have significantly more. Different sizes of drivers will\nhandle different frequency ranges. A woofer will handle the lower frequencies\nso, if you favour bass response, look out for a speaker with a dedicated\nwoofer. Mid-range and tweeters will handle the mid and higher frequencies\nrespectively. In terms of sound quality, it's typically better to have a\ndedicated driver for each frequency range, rather than fewer drivers\nperforming double duties.\n\n#### Hands-free calling\n\nLots of Bluetooth speakers will also have a built-in microphone, which means\nyou can use them for hands-free calls. This means they can serve a useful dual\npurpose and are a better option than using your phone's speaker.\n\n **READ NEXT:[Our pick of the best desktop speakers to buy for gaming and\nmusic](/tvs-entertainment/1405463/best-pc-desktop-speakers-uk)**\n\n## The best Bluetooth speakers to buy\n\n### 1\\.

Each of these ultraportable units houses a 3W driver and a\npassive radiator. These aren't as impressive as some of its rivals, such as\nthe Tribit XSound Go, which we'd recommend over the Juice Duet for its audio\nfidelity.\n\nHowever, no other budget Bluetooth speakers offer a true stereo experience \u2013\nthese even work over 10m apart from each other, which is brilliant. The\nspeakers are also IPX4-rated, which means they'll survive a splash and, with\nintegrated media controls, you can control your media.\n\n **Key specs \u2013 Speakers:** 2; **RMS power output:** 2 x 3W; **Wireless:**\nBluetooth; **Dimensions:** 155 x 97 x 56mm; **Weight:** 305g\n\n![Image of Juice Duet Bluetooth Magnetic Double Speaker, With IPX4 Water Proof\nProtection, Wireless Rechargeable Device, Super Bass, for Smartphone, Mp3\nPlayer, Tablet, Laptop, PC, Travel, Black](https://m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/41N76dMaCXL._SL160_.jpg)  \n\n#### [Juice Duet Bluetooth Magnetic Double Speaker, With IPX4 Water Proof\nProtection, Wireless Rechargeable Device, Super Bass, for Smartphone, Mp3\nPlayer, Tablet, Laptop, PC, Travel,\nBlack](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07HCPJQ6N?tag=experevi-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1404240-WIdgetWide)\n\n\u00a325.00 [Buy\nnow](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07HCPJQ6N?tag=experevi-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1404240-WIdgetWide)\n[![](https://cdn1.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/modules/contrib/amazon_wysiwyg/plugins/amazon_wysiwyg/images/amazon_logo.svg)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07HCPJQ6N?tag=experevi-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1404240-WIdgetWide)\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\.

Not only\ndoes it sound good, but it's fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating, which\nallows it to be submerged for up to 30 minutes at a depth of a metre and,\nbetter still, it has an incredible battery life of 24 hours.\n\nNow, it might not sound as refined or as controlled as the Creative Muvo 2c\nbelow, nor will it fit in the palm of your hand, but the XSound Go is easy to\ncarry around. The physical media key buttons at the top make it easy to change\nsongs and adjust the volume.

The third-generation iteration features a 1.6in speaker\ncompared with the original\u2019s 0.6in tweeter and the difference in sound quality\nis marked. It\u2019s significantly richer and more bassy and works well as a\nstandalone speaker in a small room, though it\u2019s still best used while linked\nto a bigger speaker system.\n\nAlexa is not the smartest of voice assistants but the third-gen Echo Dot is\nbigger and better than its predecessors in every way and is superb value for\nmoney at under \u00a350.\n\n **Read our full[Amazon Echo Dot (3rd gen) review](/amazon/amazon-eho-dot\n\"Amazon Echo Dot review\") for details**\n\n **Key specs \u2013 Speakers:** 1; **RMS power output:** Unknown; **Wireless:**\nBluetooth; **Dimensions:** 43 x 43 x 99mm; **Weight:** 300g\n\n![Image of Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal\nFabric](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41hX+2Es+vL._SL160_.jpg)  \n\n#### [Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal\nFabric](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07PJV3JPR?tag=experevi-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1404240-WIdgetWide)\n\n\u00a324.99 [Buy\nnow](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07PJV3JPR?tag=experevi-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1404240-WIdgetWide)\n[![](https://cdn1.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/modules/contrib/amazon_wysiwyg/plugins/amazon_wysiwyg/images/amazon_logo.svg)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07PJV3JPR?tag=experevi-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1404240-WIdgetWide)\n![](https://cdn1.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/themes/expertreviews2/images/amazon-\nprime-logo.png)\n\n![Image of Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) - Smart speaker with Alexa -\nCharcoal](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41CRnvYqmqL._SL160_.jpg)  \n\n#### [Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa -\nCharcoal](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FZ8S74R?tag=expertreviews_us-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1404240-WIdgetWide)\n\n$34.08 [Buy\nnow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FZ8S74R?tag=expertreviews_us-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1404240-WIdgetWide)\n[![](https://cdn1.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/modules/contrib/amazon_wysiwyg/plugins/amazon_wysiwyg/images/amazon_logo.svg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FZ8S74R?tag=expertreviews_us-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1404240-WIdgetWide)\n![](https://cdn1.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/themes/expertreviews2/images/amazon-\nprime-logo.png)\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\.

Its rubber casing makes it rugged enough to\nsurvive bumps and knocks and IPX7-rating means it\u2019s capable of withstanding\nimmersion in water for a short period of time. The night black and sand white\nversions both look smart, while the other variants - space blue, ivy green and\ncoral red - offer more eye-catching alternatives. There\u2019s voice assistant\nsupport, too, and the Boomster Go can double up as a hands-free kit for your\nphone if you need to take a call when using it.\n\nSonically, the Boomster Go delivers an enjoyable listen. Instrument separation\nis impressive for a speaker of its size and there\u2019s clarity in the mids and\ntreble. Their prominence does leave the Boomster Go lacking a little in the\nbass department but at max volume, the speaker still packs a decent punch. For\nbest results, you\u2019ll want to pair up two for a stereo experience.\n\nWith all that going for it, plus battery life of up to ten hours at around\nhalf volume, the Boomster is a great Bluetooth speaker that\u2019s ideal for\noutings or lazy days spent sunbathing in the garden.\n\n **Key specs \u2013 Speakers:** 1; **RMS power output:** 10W; **Wireless:**\nBluetooth 5.0; **Dimensions:** 107 x 100 x 46mm; **Weight:** 355g\n\n **[Buy now from Teufel](https://www.teufelaudio.com/uk/bluetooth/boomster-\ngo-p19347.html \"Buy now from Teufel\")**\n\n* * *\n\n### 7\\.

This\nsecond-generation iteration looks near-identical to its predecessor but there\nare a whole host of improvements.

Think Notting Hill Carnival, outdoor festivals and very, very large\ngarden parties \u2013 this has you covered.\n\nElsewhere, the speaker has an app, which allows you to tweak the EQ settings\nand utilise the integrated music services. There's a USB and 3.5mm auxiliary\njack for wired connections; a kettle plug to charge the LiFePo 4 battery,\nwhich lasts 8 hours on a single charge.
