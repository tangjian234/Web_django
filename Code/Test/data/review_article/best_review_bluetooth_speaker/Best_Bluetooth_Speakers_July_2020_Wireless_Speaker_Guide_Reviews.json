If you\u2019re looking for the best overall speaker\nexperience, this is the choice for you.\n\n**Read Full Review** : [JBL Charge 4 Review](jbl-charge-4-review)\n\n  \n\nPros\n\n  \n\n  * __Amazing, room-filling sound quality\n  * __Stellar battery life\n  * __IPX7 water resistance\n\nCons\n\n  * __Heavier than other models\n  * __Doesn\u2019t offer 360-degree sound\n  * __Takes longer to charge\n\n  \n\nJBL is one of the biggest names in the portable speaker world, and it\u2019s easy\nto see why with the JBL Charge 4. This powerful Bluetooth speaker offers some\nincredible features. Weighing in at 3 pounds, it\u2019s a little heavier than some\nof the other choices on our list, but the added weight lends some extra\ndurability to the whole thing. It also features an IPX7 waterproof rating,\nmeaning it can be fully submerged in water without worry.\n\nThe Charge 4\u2019s battery life is one of its best features, with an impressive\n20+ hours on a single charge. You\u2019ll also be impressed by the superb sound\nquality that the Charge 4 offers. Its powerful bass and clear, crisp high\ntones make for an enjoyable listening experience, whether inside by yourself\nor outside at a pool party. And speaking of pool parties, the Charge speaker\ncan connect to up to 100 additional JBL speakers for the ultimate dance party.\nThe only thing we would love to see here is 360-degree sound, but you can\nstill achieve something similar by connecting multiple speakers.\n\n### **#2** OontZ Angle 3 Bluetooth Speaker\n\nSale\n\n[ ![Our #2 Pick is the OontZ Angle 3 Bluetooth Speaker](//m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/41ClBa+vEKL.jpg)\n](//www.amazon.com/dp/B010OYASRG?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Our #2 Pick is the OontZ Angle 3 Bluetooth\nSpeaker\")\n\n[](//www.amazon.com/dp/B010OYASRG?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Reviews on Amazon\")\n\n52,075 Reviews\n\n[ Our #2 Pick is the OontZ Angle 3 Bluetooth Speaker\n](//www.amazon.com/dp/B010OYASRG?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Our #2 Pick is the OontZ Angle 3 Bluetooth\nSpeaker\")\n\n[](//www.amazon.com/gp/prime/?tag=best-bluetooth-speaker-20 \"Amazon Prime\")\n\n[Check Price](//www.amazon.com/dp/B010OYASRG?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Check Price\")\n\n_Award:_ **HONORABLE MENTION**\n\n**WHY WE LIKE IT:** A small, yet powerful Bluetooth speaker offers a rich\naudio experience at an affordable entry point. It\u2019s also splash resistant and\ndurable enough to take a drop or two.\n\n  \n\nPros\n\n  \n\n  * __Rich audio in a small package\n  * __Stellar, 30-hour battery life\n  * __IPX5 water resistance\n\nCons\n\n  * __Lack of premium features\n  * __Some connection drops\n\n  \n\nThe OontZ Angle 3 strays away from the traditional cylindrical Bluetooth\nspeaker design. Instead, it stays true to its name with its pyramidal design\nthat\u2019s more stable on a greater variety of surfaces. Other than this angular\ndesign, though, the OontZ is a fairly simple, unassuming speaker without the\nextra bells and whistles you might find on other, more expensive speakers.\n\nDon\u2019t let the Angle 3\u2019s otherwise simple design trick you into thinking it\noffers simple audio quality, though. We were impressed with the rich sound\nsuch a small speaker could create. The speaker is loud, and the sound you get\nstays clear and undistorted. The small size does mean a shorter battery life,\nhowever, clocking in at just 8 hours. In the end, though, this is a small\nprice to pay for such a high-quality and affordable Bluetooth speaker.\n\n### **#3** Bose SoundLink Color II Bluetooth Speaker\n\n[ ![Our #3 Pick is the Bose SoundLink Color II Bluetooth Speaker](//m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/51e3m5w6xWL.jpg)\n](//www.amazon.com/dp/B01HETFQKS?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Our #3 Pick is the Bose SoundLink Color II\nBluetooth Speaker\")\n\n[ Our #3 Pick is the Bose SoundLink Color II Bluetooth Speaker\n](//www.amazon.com/dp/B01HETFQKS?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Our #3 Pick is the Bose SoundLink Color II\nBluetooth Speaker\")\n\n[](//www.amazon.com/gp/prime/?tag=best-bluetooth-speaker-20 \"Amazon Prime\")\n\n[Check Price](//www.amazon.com/dp/B01HETFQKS?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Check Price\")\n\n_Award:_ **MOST PORTABLE**\n\n**WHY WE LIKE IT:** This compact Bose is extra portable, rugged and simple to\noperate. On top of all that, you get that traditional Bose audio quality,\nwhich is always a good thing.\n\n**Read Full Review** : [Bose SoundLink Mini II Review](bose-soundlink-mini-ii-\nreview)\n\n  \n\nPros\n\n  \n\n  * __IPX4 water resistance\n  * __Well-balanced, rich sound quality\n  * __More portable than others\n\nCons\n\n  * __Weak bass\n  * __No AC adapter included\n  * __Disappointing battery life\n\n  \n\nAs with other Bose speakers, the SoundLink Color II offers strong audio\nperformance with crisp highs and decent lows. The bass is a little weak here,\nbut that\u2019s to be expected with such a small speaker. However, this small\nspeaker can still pack a punch, and there\u2019s minimal distortion at higher\nvolumes. You also get a built-in microphone so you can use speakerphone\nfunctionality with your connected smartphone.\n\nWe were very appreciative of the SoundLink\u2019s compact and portable design.\nMeasuring in at just 2 inches thick and 5 inches tall and wide, this Bose\nspeaker is one of the smallest options on our list. Despite that small size,\nthe Bose is surprisingly rugged. It features a shock-absorbent silicone\nexterior that\u2019s also easy to grip on the go. It\u2019s also resistant to water\nsplashes with an IPX4 rating. We do wish the battery offered a little more\nthan 8 hours of continuous playtime, but it can be quickly charged.\n\n### **#4** Anker Soundcore Bluetooth Speaker\n\nSale\n\n[ ![Our #4 Pick is the Anker Soundcore Bluetooth Speaker](//m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/416SaKFsBGL.jpg)\n](//www.amazon.com/dp/B016XTADG2?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Our #4 Pick is the Anker Soundcore\nBluetooth Speaker\")\n\n[](//www.amazon.com/dp/B016XTADG2?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Reviews on Amazon\")\n\n29,727 Reviews\n\n[ Our #4 Pick is the Anker Soundcore Bluetooth Speaker\n](//www.amazon.com/dp/B016XTADG2?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Our #4 Pick is the Anker Soundcore\nBluetooth Speaker\")\n\n[](//www.amazon.com/gp/prime/?tag=best-bluetooth-speaker-20 \"Amazon Prime\")\n\n[Check Price](//www.amazon.com/dp/B016XTADG2?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Check Price\")\n\n_Award:_ **BEST CONNECTION RANGE**\n\n**WHY WE LIKE IT:** A super light and extra portable speaker, without\nsacrificing on sound quality. It also offers a full 24 hours of battery life\nfor extended listening and an impressive 66-foot Bluetooth range.\n\n**Read Full Review** : [Anker Soundcore Review](anker-soundcore-review)\n\n  \n\nPros\n\n  \n\n  * __Amazing 24-hour battery life\n  * __Compact, yet rugged build\n  * __Impressively loud\n\nCons\n\n  * __Not waterproof\n  * __Some speakerphone echo\n\n  \n\nYou may be surprised at just how much of a punch the Anker Soundcore Bluetooth\nspeaker packs, especially considering its size. It\u2019s one of the smallest\noptions on our list, but that doesn\u2019t mean it sacrifices on overall sound\nquality. From the moment you turn it on and start jamming, you\u2019ll notice just\nhow clear and well-balanced the audio is. It can also get incredibly loud for\nsuch a small speaker.\n\nThe Anker\u2019s battery life is also something worth noting. Clocking in at around\n24 hours, this is one of the more impressive batteries on our list. You also\nget a good level of durability with the Anker Soundcore. It can withstand\ndrops from various heights and, when combined with its compact design, it\u2019s\nthe perfect on-the-go speaker. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not waterproof, so you\u2019ll\nwant to keep this one away from the pool. All in all, though, the Anker\nSoundcore is very affordable, meaning you get a ton of value with your\npurchase here.\n\n### **#5** DOSS Soundbox Touch Bluetooth Speaker\n\nSale\n\n[ ![Our #5 Pick is the DOSS Soundbox Touch Bluetooth Speaker](//m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/51O-IAiSrML.jpg)\n](//www.amazon.com/dp/B01CQOV3YO?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Our #5 Pick is the DOSS Soundbox Touch\nBluetooth Speaker\")\n\n[ Our #5 Pick is the DOSS Soundbox Touch Bluetooth Speaker\n](//www.amazon.com/dp/B01CQOV3YO?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Our #5 Pick is the DOSS Soundbox Touch\nBluetooth Speaker\")\n\n[](//www.amazon.com/gp/prime/?tag=best-bluetooth-speaker-20 \"Amazon Prime\")\n\n[Check Price](//www.amazon.com/dp/B01CQOV3YO?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Check Price\")\n\n_Award:_ **MOST USER FRIENDLY**\n\n**WHY WE LIKE IT:** With innovative capacitive touch controls, loud volume,\nand extra-long battery life, this speaker is an excellent option for anyone\nthat wants an excellent all-around music player.\n\n  \n\nPros\n\n  \n\n  * __Innovative touch controls\n  * __Overall balanced sound quality\n  * __Impressive 20-hour battery\n\nCons\n\n  * __No water resistance\n  * __Top can scratch easily\n\n  \n\nThe DOSS Soundbox Touch\u2019s best feature is alluded to in its name. Where other\nBluetooth speakers feature physical buttons, the DOSS features an innovative\ncapacitive touch control panel on top of the speaker. This touch panel is\nintuitive and incredibly easy to use, making this one of the most user-\nfriendly Bluetooth speakers on our list. Just be aware that the touch control\npanel can scratch easily, so be careful when carrying it around with you.\n\nOn top of the touch control panel, the DOSS Soundbox Touch is designed well,\nalthough it isn\u2019t as rugged as other options, especially since it isn\u2019t water-\nresistant. However, it offers a sleek and attractive design that looks good\nanywhere you place it. You can also purchase it in several different colors.\nWe were most impressed, however, with the Soundbox\u2019s battery life at 20 hours.\nThe audio is well balanced overall, and the speaker gets impressively loud in\nspite of its compact size.\n\n### **#6** Bugani M83 Bluetooth Speaker\n\n[ ![Our #6 Pick is the Bugani M83 Bluetooth Speaker](//m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/51wAaYRzjML.jpg)\n](//www.amazon.com/dp/B07T2JDQ3X?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Our #6 Pick is the Bugani M83 Bluetooth\nSpeaker\")\n\n[ Our #6 Pick is the Bugani M83 Bluetooth Speaker\n](//www.amazon.com/dp/B07T2JDQ3X?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Our #6 Pick is the Bugani M83 Bluetooth\nSpeaker\")\n\n[](//www.amazon.com/gp/prime/?tag=best-bluetooth-speaker-20 \"Amazon Prime\")\n\n[Check Price](//www.amazon.com/dp/B07T2JDQ3X?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Check Price\")\n\n_Award:_ **LOUDEST VOLUME**\n\n**WHY WE LIKE IT:** There\u2019s a lot to love about this speaker, including its\nsuper tough design, incredibly loud volume, and amazing battery life. This\nspeaker is also packed with premium features for an even better audio\nexperience, both indoors and outdoors.\n\n  \n\nPros\n\n  \n\n  * __2x 20-watts of power\n  * __Extra rugged design\n  * __Packed with premium features\n\nCons\n\n  * __Large and heavy\n\n  \n\nThe Bugani M83 Bluetooth speaker is the largest option on our list, but that\nalso means it\u2019s the loudest. If you\u2019re looking for a speaker that can output\nsome serious volume without audio distortion, look no further. The M83 offers\na total of 40 watts of power between its two main drivers. And while the\nvolume is certainly a plus, you also get amazing sound quality from the M83.\nIt performs best with bass, which is rich and powerful, but it\u2019s mid-ranges\nand high tones are clear as well.\n\nThe Bugani also excels in its design. This is both an indoor and outdoor\nBluetooth speaker with its IPX5 water resistance rating. It\u2019s also incredibly\nrugged, with durable rubber housing that can take a hit or two without worry.\nYes, the large and rugged design makes the Bugani heavier than other options,\nbut it also includes a useful carrying handle to make transport easier.

With an IP67 rating, the speaker can take a complete\ndip into the water for up to 30 minutes without worry. Plus, it even floats,\nso you won\u2019t lose it to the depths. The UE Boom 3 is also nearly\nindestructible with an incredibly rugged design that can handle drops from\ntall heights and thousands of button presses over the speaker\u2019s life. That\nIP67 rating also means its dustproof, which is a nice bonus.\n\nWhen it comes to audio quality, the UE Boom features cutting-edge 360 degree\nsound, which creates a more immersive listening experience, no matter where\nyou are in relation to the speaker. We do wish it offered a little more\nclarity, but the bass is powerful and rich. It makes up for the lack of\nclarity with excellent equalizer functionality that gives you more control\nover the sound. The Boom 3 also gives you 15 hours of battery life for more\nextended listening sessions.\n\n### **#8** JBL Flip 4 Bluetooth Speaker\n\n[ ![Our #8 Pick is the JBL Flip 4 Bluetooth Speaker](//m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/41FHRR0d+UL.jpg)\n](//www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSYQWNY?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Our #8 Pick is the JBL Flip 4 Bluetooth\nSpeaker\")\n\n[](//www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSYQWNY?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Reviews on Amazon\")\n\n26,172 Reviews\n\n[ Our #8 Pick is the JBL Flip 4 Bluetooth Speaker\n](//www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSYQWNY?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Our #8 Pick is the JBL Flip 4 Bluetooth\nSpeaker\")\n\n[](//www.amazon.com/gp/prime/?tag=best-bluetooth-speaker-20 \"Amazon Prime\")\n\n[Check Price](//www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSYQWNY?tag=best-bluetooth-\nspeaker-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 \"Check Price\")\n\n_Award:_ **MOST DURABLE**\n\n**WHY WE LIKE IT:** This JBL speaker is a great overall option to take on the\ngo, with an extra-durable build and affordable price tag.

It\u2019s also only around 6 ounces in weight, making it the\nlightest Bluetooth speaker on our list.

The speaker is impressively loud and audio is accurate, with\ncrisp highs and rich lows.\n\nThe XLEADER also boasts a 1200 mAH lithium-ion battery, which gives you around\n15 hours of playtime on a single charge. Charging is quick with the included\nmicro USB cable, at just around 2 hours.

Just be careful when you\u2019re getting it in and out of your\npockets. The control panel is on top of the speaker, and it\u2019s incredibly easy\nto use with touch functionality and clearly marked buttons.\n\n### How We Decided\n\nAs we started to test each Bluetooth speaker on our list, we started by\nconsidering design and durability. Bluetooth speakers are often out and\nvisible to you and your guests, so they should be designed well. We favored\noptions that looked good, and even awarded some bonus points for options that\nincluded additional design features like built-in lights or various color\noptions. We ranked speakers higher if they provided some kind of water\nresistance and ruggedness. The best Bluetooth speakers should be able to take\na drop or two without breaking.\n\nNext, we only included speakers on our list that sound good. While this is a\nsomewhat subjective consideration, we still think it\u2019s one of the most\nimportant features. The speakers on our list sound good at both low and high\nvolume, and we gave preference to options with powerful bass and clear,\naccurate highs. We also favored options that included extra options like\nvolume and bass boosters.\n\nFinally, we considered each speaker\u2019s overall usability. We only included\nspeakers that were easy to use. The options on our list feature easy-to-press\nonboard control buttons and reliable Bluetooth connectivity. We favored\nspeakers with long battery lives, up to 24 hours in some cases, and relatively\nshort charge times. We also made sure to only include portable Bluetooth\nspeakers on our list, either in size or by including options like carrying\nhandles to make them easier to carry.\n\n## Best Bluetooth Speaker Buyer\u2019s Guide\n\n### The Most Important Features to Consider\n\n  1. **Audio Quality**  \nAs with any audio product, the sound quality your Bluetooth speakers produce\nis one of the first things you should consider when making a new purchase. Of\ncourse, audio quality can be somewhat of a subjective thing, especially when\nsome speakers are better than others in different situations. If you\u2019re\nlooking to purchase the best outdoor Bluetooth speaker, then you\u2019ll want\nsomething with huge amounts of volume. Or, if you want the best indoor\nBluetooth speaker, you\u2019ll want something that focuses on producing rich lows\nand crisp highs so you can really hear the music the way the musicians\nintended it.\n\n  2. **Portability**  \nBluetooth speakers are the best portable speakers around, so it\u2019s important\nthat you find an option you can easily move around the house or take along\nwith you as you travel. When it comes to portability, consider how heavy the\nBluetooth speaker is along with its overall size. If you purchase a large\nBluetooth speaker, you\u2019ll want to be sure it includes some kind of carrying\nhandle to make it easier to take with you.\n\n  3. **Water Resistance and Durability**  \nMany Bluetooth speakers are now water resistant, and if you\u2019re planning on\nplaying music by the pool or while you\u2019re camping, this is an absolute must-\nhave feature. Water resistance is measured using an Ingress Protection, or IP,\nrating. When you see this rating, it will usually look something like IP65 or\nIPX4. The first digit indicates the level of protection against the ingress of\nsolids, while the second digit measures against liquids. The higher the number\nhere, the better. For use by the pool, we recommend purchasing a Bluetooth\nspeaker with at least an IPX4 rating, which protects against splashed water\nfrom any direction. However, if you\u2019re worried about the speaker falling in\nthe water, you\u2019ll need to get something IPX7 or higher. You\u2019ll also want a\nBluetooth speaker that can handle a few drops and bumps without being damaged\npast the point of functioning. Since you\u2019re likely going to carry your speaker\naround with you, consider an option that provides some durability features\nlike rubber edges or completely drop-proof casing.\n\n  4. **Battery Life**  \nDue to the portable nature of Bluetooth speakers, you\u2019ll want to be sure you\nget something with a long-lasting battery, especially if you\u2019re going to be\naway from an outlet for a while. Battery life can vary greatly depending on\nhow you use the speaker. For example, playing music at max volume for long\nperiods of time is going to deplete your battery much faster. Also, larger\nspeakers tend to have larger batteries. Consider how often you\u2019ll want to use\nyour speaker away from a place you can charge it and base your battery life\nneeds off of that.\n\n  5. **Wireless Range**  \nHow far away can your phone be from the speaker you purchase? This is\nimportant, especially if you\u2019re in a big house or at a party with a ton of\npeople. Most Bluetooth connections offer a maximum range of around 33 feet,\nbut there are some Bluetooth speakers that offer more or less.\n\n## Bluetooth Speakers FAQs\n\n### Which Bluetooth speaker is the loudest?\n\nThe loudest Bluetooth speaker on our list is the Bugani M83.

These digital audio portable speakers use bluetooth\ntechnology for reception of sound for playback through passive radiators.\nThere are three primary categories of bluetooth speakers based on their use\nincluding waterproof, party, rugged and an outdoor speaker.\n\nThere are various crucial aspects to consider when buying your portable\nbluetooth speaker. Opt for one with outstanding sound quality and audio\nperformance and battery life of not less than 30 minutes. Great sounding high\nquality wireless speakers are also sometimes IPX7 rated for durability.\n\nMost shoppers erroneously opt for speakers of 2018 with the highest price\nrange or renowned brands like Amazon Alexa, Bose soundlink mini ii and jbl\ncharge. Others will look for a wireless speaker with a high volume or one\nwhich sounded good with little regard to its sound bars. By considering the\ncritical factors, however, you will get the best speakers you can buy if you\nrely on Gadget Review for speaker delivering the best ever services since\nyears.\n\n**What's The Price Range For Bluetooth Speakers?**\n\nThere are numerous types of Bluetooth speaker, each with their own retail\nprice depending on factors such as type, specifications and brand. However,\nmost wireless speakers fall within the range of $50 to $300.\n\nThe best Bluetooth speaker brands include Fugoo, Bose, Ultimate Ears, Philips\nand a few others.\n\n**Key Features to Look For**\n\nAudio or sound quality is the major factor that differentiates a great\nBluetooth speakers from the pact. But so is portability, especially if you\nplan to travel with your Bluetooth speaker. But first ensure you consider a\nspeaker that offers an outstanding battery life (at least 8 - 10 hours of\nbattery).\n\nAudio Quality: An impressive audio performance is the first key feature to\nlook at. When tested using a number of musical genres, the speaker needs to\nproduce balanced frequency ranges, with crisp treble and a balance between\nbass and midrange.\n\nControls Features & Durability: Different Bluetooth speakers may have\ndifferent control features. The most common of these include the Hands-Free\nProfile that allows for voice commands, Headset Profile that enables the\nspeakerphone feature, and the Remote Control Profile from which you can\nconveniently control your playlist. A more reliable speaker should also be\ndurable and its design has a huge say in this as well as its portability. Some\nare made to resist falls, sand, and water, meaning that they are ideal for use\nin different terrains.\n\nBattery Life and Performance: More often than not, the battery life of most\nBluetooth speakers has a range of somewhere between 6 and 40 hours standard.\nSome models have the capability of serving as power banks for mobile gadgets\nand run on rechargeable batteries.\n\nIf you\u2019re searching for the best Bluetooth speaker or best outdoor Bluetooth\nSpeakers, do yourself a favor by reading our expert speaker reviews, where the\nlatest **Bluetooth speaker reviews** and lists of the top Bluetooth speakers\nare honestly compared! With that in mind, it's important to understand that\nBluetooth speakers are often divided into categories based on use. Rugged\nspeakers are designed for outdoor travel and are usually smaller so they can\nfit in a backpack. Waterproof speakers are made for chilling by the pool or on\nthe beach, though these speakers are often one in the same as the\naforementioned. Party speakers can link up with each and often include lights\nor display options to impress onlookers while spilling out tunes. And then\nthere are the more versatile speakers, which often include a mic and speaker\nphone for taking phone calls. Nevertheless, all of the previously mentioned\nBluetooth speakers could include this feature.\n\nSo, what is Bluetooth speaker?\n\nJust like the name suggests, Bluetooth Speakers are digital audio receivers\n(speakers) that rely on Bluetooth technology to receive sound from other\ndevices for playback. These speakers have a built-in amplifier that allows\nmagnification of the digital sound signals upon transmission from your smart\ndevice without the need for plug-in or cable attachments. In essence,\nBluetooth is a wireless technology whereby two devices communicate with each\nother, one as the signal transmitter and the other a receiver. These speakers\nare well designed to be portable, utilize rechargeable batteries and have over\nthe past few years gained much popularity among lovers of music.\n\nYour entertainment experience with a new set of Bluetooth speakers will be\ndetermined by how well you consider the above mentioned factors. However,\nbuyers tend to overlook a few key factors.\n\nDon\u2019t buy based on price: Some shoppers tend to go for high cost Bluetooth\nspeakers assuming that they are the best quality while others tend to consider\naffordability. Instead of buying based entirely on price, take time to conduct\nsome research to ensure you are getting value for your money.\n\nDon't buy on brand alone: Sure we've suggested some top brands, but make sure\nthey meet all of your requirements.
