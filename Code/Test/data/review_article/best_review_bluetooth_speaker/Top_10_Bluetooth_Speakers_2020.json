Moving\nyour giant speaker to your room, plugging in an audio cable, connecting it to\nyour laptop, and finding the playlist can take all the fun out of the\nlistening experience. With portable Bluetooth speakers, you won\u2019t get tangled\nup in cords, won\u2019t have to lug around a subwoofer, and you'll have music with\nyou in every room of the house.\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.thecoupon.co/images/5184/merchantimage_4815_Bluetooth%20Speakers-\nPhoto%201.jpeg)\n\n## Speakers for the Modern Age\n\nWe can probably all think back to the dual-tower speakers in our living room\nor bedroom. They were giant and immovable \u2014 wherever you set them up was where\nthey were going to stay.\n\nYou might have had a roommate who _had_ to listen to music, even when they\nwere in the other room. So as a side effect, you listened to them turn the\nstereo up full blast until it shook the walls and rattled your teeth.\n\nNow, you have the option to find a portable speaker that you can take from\nroom to room. There are even waterproof speakers so you can listen to music in\nthe bathtub, in the pool, or just out on the patio.\n\n## Bluetooth Speakers\n\nEven though some Bluetooth speakers are known for being compact and portable,\nthat\u2019s not what defines a Bluetooth speaker. In fact, you can have a giant\nspeaker setup, but as long as it\u2019s accessible via Bluetooth, it still falls\nunder this category.\n\nBluetooth devices make it simple to sync your device to your speakers without\nany effort. Most smartphones and smart devices created after 2010 will have\nsufficient Bluetooth technology, and Bluetooth has been evolving ever since\nits creation in 1994.\n\nSpeakers with built-in Bluetooth work similarly to a Wi-Fi connection. Once\nyou connect your device to that speaker, it will remember the speaker as a\nreliable connection, making it simple to connect again.\n\n## Wireless Speakers\n\nRemember when laptop computers came out and how excited we all were that\ncomputers could be used on the go? You could detach from your desk, leave the\noffice, work from a coffee shop, and not worry about the nearest outlet.\nWireless speakers capture that same joy and amplify it (pun intended).\n\nAs cell phones, laptops, and TVs get thinner, so do their speakers. Because of\nthis, sound quality deteriorates and your speakers don\u2019t match the high-tech\nquality of your device. Even though you can have 24/7 access to your favorite\ndownloaded playlist, it\u2019s a bummer to hear that new Lizzo song with a\ndiminished bass effect. Wireless speakers help take care of this, pairing with\nyour small, sleek devices so you don\u2019t have to sacrifice sound quality when\nchoosing a tinier device profile.\n\nSome wireless speakers will need to be plugged in while others have a\nrechargeable battery that you can take with you anywhere. You can find\nbattery-charged speakers that play music for up to 12 hours while still\nstaying under $100. Of course, every 12 hours, you\u2019ll just need to recharge\nthese batteries.\n\n## Why Wouldn\u2019t You Choose Wireless?\n\nThe biggest drawback to a wireless, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth speaker is sound\nquality. You\u2019re purchasing a speaker because of its convenience, so typically\nsound specs are overlooked. Because data needs to be transferred via a digital\nchannel, some of that sound quality will be lost to a trained audiophile\u2019s\near.\n\nFor someone whose biggest priority is sound quality, you might want a speaker\nthat connects through an audio cable. However, this is usually only an issue\nfor someone who\u2019s extremely picky about their music quality \u2014 most folks\nlooking for an easy way to play music out loud will not be disappointed with\nthe quality of a wireless speaker.\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.thecoupon.co/images/3974/merchantimage_4793_Bluetooth%20Speakers-\nPhoto%202.jpeg)\n\n## Water-Resistant Speakers\n\nThanks to modern technology, not only do we have music at our fingertips and\naround every corner, but we also have waterproof speakers that aren\u2019t afraid\nof rain. Since you\u2019ll be taking your speaker with you just about anywhere,\nit\u2019s nice to not have to worry about it getting wet.\n\nThere is a difference between a water-resistant speaker and a waterproof\nspeaker, though. Water-resistant speakers will survive in the event of rain or\na spill, but they\u2019re typically not designed to be fully submerged in the\nwater.\n\nWaterproof speakers prioritize protection against water and are designed to be\nout by the pool or by the lake. Some of these can be submerged and might even\nbe buoyant, so if it falls off the edge of a boat, you'll find it floating in\nthe waves nearby. If you\u2019re wanting a speaker to join you on an afternoon of\ntubing, look for these speakers that are built primarily for use in water.\nOtherwise, you\u2019ll find your speaker to be waterlogged in no time.\n\n## Features to Avoid in a Bluetooth Speaker\n\nFor some newer portable speakers, they\u2019ll feature a list of options on how you\ncan connect your speaker to your device. Some might be compatible with Wi-Fi,\nBluetooth, and other nuanced audio channels, while others might work best with\none specific channel. If you already have a device where your music lives,\nmake sure you find a speaker that is compatible. You don\u2019t want to buy a high-\nend speaker only to find that your music lives on a device that is too old to\nconnect.\n\n## Features to Look For in a Portable Speaker\n\nSince you\u2019re buying a new portable speaker to play music louder than your\nphone can handle, you want it to reach just the right volume level for your\nneeds. There are different requirements for a speaker that can play out to a\n10-foot radius and one that can clearly be heard between separate rooms.\n\nTo determine the right power of audio quality, you\u2019ll want to look at the size\nand wattage of the portable speaker. Larger speakers generally allow for\nbetter audio quality and combined with more watts (10 watts is a good\nreference point), you\u2019ll find a speaker that can emit high-quality sound at a\nhigher volume.\n\nIf you see higher wattage in a smaller speaker, you might be asking for\ntrouble. This is a formula for a static and audio blow-out, which will leave\nyour speaker rattling. Make sure that your speaker\u2019s size and power are not\nsuspiciously disproportionate.\n\n## Trusting our Top Pick\n\nNavigating the many choices for every consumer purchase can be challenging.\nOur team spends hours doing research, combing through forums, and reading\nconsumer reviews on even the most basic of household items, and we summarize\nthat information in clear, precise comparisons.
