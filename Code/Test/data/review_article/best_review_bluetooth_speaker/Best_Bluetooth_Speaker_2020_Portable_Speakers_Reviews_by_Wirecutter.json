Our other picks will not change.\n\nYour guide\n\n  * ![Brent Butterworth](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/butterworth-brent.jpg)\n\n[Brent Butterworth](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/authors/brent-\nbutterworth/)\n\nShare this review\n\n[](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n%7C Wirecutter&url=https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-bluetooth-\nspeaker/&via=wirecutter)\n\n[](https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-\nbluetooth-speaker/)\n\n[](mailto:?subject=Wirecutter: The Best Portable Bluetooth\nSpeaker&body=Wirecutter: The Best Portable Bluetooth\nSpeaker%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-bluetooth-\nspeaker/)\n\nPortable Bluetooth speakers come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and prices, so\nit\u2019s impossible to say that any one model is perfect for everyone. But we\nthink the [UE Wonderboom\n2](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34559/156465/4/101034/?merchant=Amazon)\nhas the best chance of delighting your ears without walloping your finances.\nThis speaker has a full, clear sound and a compact design. It\u2019s also\nwaterproof and dustproof, and built to survive even the most adventurous\nvacations.\n\n#### Our pick\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34559/156816/4/101008?merchant=Best%20Buy)\n\n### [UE Wonderboom\n2](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34559/156816/4/101008?merchant=Best%20Buy\n\"UE Wonderboom 2\")\n\n## [The best portable bluetooth\nspeaker](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34559/156816/4/101008?merchant=Best%20Buy\n\"The best portable bluetooth speaker\")\n\nThe Wonderboom 2 has a natural sound and a cool design, and it\u2019s built to\nsurvive almost any outdoor adventure.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$100* from Best\nBuy](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34559/156816/4/101008?merchant=Best%20Buy)\n\n[$70 from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34559/156465/4/101008?merchant=Amazon)\n\nMay be out of stock\n\n*At the time of publishing, the price was $92.\n\nThe [UE Wonderboom\n2](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34559/156465/4/101034/?merchant=Amazon)\nis as euphonious as Ariana Grande but as tough as Lara Croft. In our blind\ntests, our panelists picked this Bluetooth speaker as the best-sounding model\nunder $100, with its especially clear vocal reproduction and a decent amount\nof bass for its size. It has an IP67 rating and is one of the most rugged\nBluetooth speakers we\u2019ve tested, able to survive a 5-foot drop and a dunking\nin 1 meter of water\u2014but because it floats, it\u2019ll probably never dive that\ndeep. The Wonderboom 2\u2019s only downside is its battery life, which, at eight\nhours, is adequate but not impressive. We like the Wonderboom\u2019s cute, compact\ndesign, even if the almost-spherical shape makes this model a little tougher\nto pack away in a suitcase pocket or laptop bag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Upgrade pick\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34560/156466/4/101009?merchant=Amazon)\n\n### [JBL Xtreme\n2](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34560/156466/4/101009?merchant=Amazon\n\"JBL Xtreme 2\")\n\n## [The best sounding bluetooth\nspeaker](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34560/156466/4/101009?merchant=Amazon\n\"The best sounding bluetooth speaker\")\n\nThe Xtreme 2 easily fills a large room (or a small parking lot) with\nsatisfying sound, and its rugged, waterproof design makes it trunk-friendly.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$192* from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34560/156466/4/101009?merchant=Amazon)\n\n[$350 from Best\nBuy](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34560/156817/4/101009?merchant=Best%20Buy)\n\n*At the time of publishing, the price was $250.\n\nIf you want a portable Bluetooth speaker that approaches the sound of a good\nsmall stereo system yet is rugged enough to take almost anywhere, the [JBL\nXtreme\n2](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34560/156466/4/101035/?merchant=Amazon)\nis a terrific choice. Three of our four listeners thought the Xtreme 2 was the\nbest-sounding speaker we tested, praising it for its ample bass, high maximum\nvolume, and overall clear, clean sound. It\u2019s IPX7-rated, which means it can\nsurvive submersion in 1 meter of water, and it includes a handy, strong\ncarrying strap. The Xtreme 2 also delivered 19 hours of battery life. But it\u2019s\nmuch larger and pricier than the UE Wonderboom 2.\n\n#### Also great\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34561/156467/4/101010?merchant=Amazon)\n\n### [Sony SRS-\nXB32](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34561/156467/4/101010?merchant=Amazon\n\"Sony SRS-XB32\")\n\n## [The midsize sedan of portable BT\nspeakers](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34561/156467/4/101010?merchant=Amazon\n\"The midsize sedan of portable BT speakers\")\n\nThe SRS-XB32 has a respectably big, full sound, with a rugged design and lots\nof features.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$96* from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34561/156467/4/101010?merchant=Amazon)\n\n[$150 from Best\nBuy](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34561/156818/4/101010?merchant=Best%20Buy)\n\n*At the time of publishing, the price was $0.\n\nIf you need something that sounds a little louder and fuller than the UE\nWonderboom 2, but that\u2019s more portable and affordable than the JBL Xtreme 2,\nthe [Sony SRS-\nXB32](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34561/156467/4/101036/?merchant=Amazon)\nfinds a nice middle ground. It\u2019s about twice the Wonderboom 2\u2019s size, plays a\nlittle bit louder, and puts out a lot more bass. It\u2019s also rugged, with an\nIP67 waterproof/dustproof rating. In our battery test, it automatically\nreduced its volume after about six hours of fairly loud use, but it played for\nabout five more hours after that. It also has adjustable multicolor lights and\nflashing strobes, which don\u2019t appeal to us\u2014but somebody must like these things\nor manufacturers wouldn\u2019t keep including them.\n\n#### Budget pick\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24284/130004/4/101011?merchant=Amazon)\n\n### [Tribit XSound\nGo](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24284/130004/4/101011?merchant=Amazon\n\"Tribit XSound Go\")\n\n## [Very good sound for under\n$35](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24284/130004/4/101011?merchant=Amazon\n\"Very good sound for under $35\")\n\nThe Tribit XSound Go is the best speaker we\u2019ve heard in its price range, and\nit\u2019s compact and waterproof to boot.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$30* from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24284/130004/4/101011?merchant=Amazon)\n\n*At the time of publishing, the price was $33.\n\nIf you want to spend the bare minimum on an all-around good portable Bluetooth\nspeaker, the [Tribit XSound\nGo](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24284/130004/4/69616/?merchant=Amazon)\nis a great choice. Its sound is obviously clearer and louder than that of\nalmost all other budget Bluetooth speakers. The XSound Go is also small enough\nto slip into a laptop bag or an already stuffed suitcase, and it will run 10\u00bd\nhours on a charge. Plus, it\u2019s IPX7-rated, which means it\u2019s sufficiently\nwaterproof to survive a half-hour dunking in 1 meter of water, and it has a\nspeakerphone function.\n\n#### Also great\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24285/154683/4/101012?merchant=Cabela's)\n\n### [EcoXGear\nEcoBoulder+](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24285/154683/4/101012?merchant=Cabela's\n\"EcoXGear EcoBoulder+\")\n\n## [For pool parties and\ntailgating](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24285/154683/4/101012?merchant=Cabela's\n\"For pool parties and tailgating\")\n\nThe EcoBoulder+ plays amazingly loud, sounds very good, is built to survive\nthe outdoors, and also opens bottles.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$200 from\nCabela's](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24285/154683/4/101012?merchant=Cabela's)\n\n[Buy from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24285/130005/4/101012?merchant=Amazon)\n\nThe [EcoXGear\nEcoBoulder+](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24285/130005/4/69617/?merchant=Amazon)\nis a completely different kind of portable Bluetooth speaker than our other\npicks\u2014it pumps out maximum volume for pool parties, picnics, and tailgating\nevents. Although it can blast, it can also soothe\u2014not only with its full,\nnatural sound, but also with a built-in bottle opener and cupholders.

I have written reviews for\nmagazines and websites including Sound & Vision, Home Theater Review,\nLifeWire, and Home Theater. I\u2019ve probably conducted more blind tests of audio\nproducts than any other journalist, and I\u2019ve tested somewhere around 350\nwireless speakers to date. Since 2008 I have brought portable Bluetooth\nspeakers on about 100 trips, from bike tours to transoceanic junkets to week-\nlong trade-show slogs.\n\nFor our most recent listening tests, I was a panelist, along with Wirecutter\nsenior staff writer Lauren Dragan and two musicians I often play with in Los\nAngeles: woodwind player Dan Gonda and drummer Sammy Velick, both in their\nlate 30s. Dan and Sammy have considerable experience in music performance and\nproduction. And both of them own a few Bluetooth speakers and have heard many\nmore of them in my home, where I use them to demo jazz tunes for musicians in\nmy jam sessions.\n\n## Who should buy a portable Bluetooth speaker\n\nAnyone who owns a smartphone or tablet would probably enjoy owning a portable\nBluetooth speaker, which can improve the listening experience anywhere.\nBluetooth is available in every current smartphone and tablet, as well as in\nmost laptop computers, so you don\u2019t need additional equipment. Unlike smart\nspeakers and Wi-Fi speakers, Bluetooth speakers don\u2019t require a network\nconnection and the use of special apps\u2014whatever you play on the phone will\nplay through the speaker.\n\nPortable Bluetooth speakers have a rechargeable battery and are frequently\nwaterproof or splash-proof, so you can easily move them around the house or\ntake them to a park or the beach. We\u2019ve found that they make hotel rooms feel\nmore like home.\n\nThe best of these speakers deliver sound quality that\u2019s good enough for casual\nmusic listening, podcasts, and Internet radio. Although Bluetooth does degrade\nsound quality slightly, you\u2019re unlikely to hear the effects through relatively\nlow-quality speakers such as these. If you\u2019re worried about it, take the\n[online blind test](http://www.brentbutterworth.com/bluetooth-blind-test.html)\non my website and see what you think.\n\nIf sound quality and volume are your top priorities, and you don\u2019t plan to\ntake the speaker out of your house, you may want to check out the larger, more\npowerful speakers featured in our other tabletop speaker guides:\n\n  * [![The Best Home Bluetooth Speaker](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bluetooth-speakers-2020-lowres-8688-120x80.jpg)](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-home-bluetooth-speaker/)\n\n### [The Best Home Bluetooth\nSpeaker](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-home-bluetooth-\nspeaker/)\n\n[Klipsch\u2019s The One\nII](https://wclink.co/link/36994/159503/4/110268/?merchant=Amazon) Bluetooth\nspeaker is a great way to get full, satisfying sound in the home with no need\nfor complicated setup or special apps.\n\n  * [![Sonos One Review: Is This the Best Smart Speaker?](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sonos-one-top-3x2-lowres636-6061-120x80.jpg)](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/sonos-one/)\n\n### [Sonos One Review: Is This the Best Smart\nSpeaker?](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/sonos-one/)\n\nThe [Sonos One](https://wclink.co/link/21820/125374/4/67883/?merchant=Amazon)\nis an Amazon Echo in a great Sonos speaker, but still a work in progress for\nAlexa, Google Assistant, AirPlay, and everything else.\n\nFor true high-fidelity sound, we recommend a pair of [decent bookshelf\nspeakers](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-bookshelf-speakers/)\nand a [stereo receiver](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-\nstereo-receiver/) or one of the top picks from our [best computer\nspeakers](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-computer-speakers/)\nguide. You\u2019ll get clearer sound, much better stereo imaging, and usually much\ndeeper bass response. You can add a Bluetooth adapter if the system doesn\u2019t\nalready have Bluetooth built in.\n\nVoice control of the sort popularized by the [Amazon\nEcho](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34563/156473/4/103755/?merchant=Amazon)\nand [Google Home](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/google-home-\nvoice-controlled-speaker/) is uncommon in portable Bluetooth speakers, because\nalmost all voice-command technologies require a Wi-Fi connection to function.\nSome Bluetooth speakers provide a button that activates your smartphone\u2019s\nvoice-command technology (such as Google Assistant), but because you can\naccess those features straight from your phone, this isn\u2019t a big advantage.\n\n## How we picked\n\n![Over a dozen of the portable bluetooth speakers we tested, sitting on and\naround a red and white hard-sided cooler.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/bluetooth-speakers-2019-lowres-4902-120x80.jpg) Here\nare some of the speakers we tested for our fall 2019 update. Photo: Rozette\nRago\n\nI\u2019d estimate that there are a couple thousand models of Bluetooth speakers now\navailable, many sold under obscure brands and sometimes only through Amazon.\nConsidering that new ones seem to appear every week, it would be impossible to\nfind and hear them all. But we\u2019ve listened to most of the major models and are\nalways on the lookout for promising new models to test.\n\nWe use the following criteria to help us decide which speakers to call in for\ntesting:\n\n  *  **Portability and battery life:** Although any Bluetooth speaker can be lugged around, we focused on models that have rechargeable batteries and are designed to take a trip to the beach or the park with no hassle.\n  *  **Ruggedness and waterproof design:** We gave priority to speakers that are built to survive the knocks and bumps of travel. Although we didn\u2019t limit our testing to waterproof speakers, we did give preference in our judging to speakers with an [Ingress Protection (IP) rating](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/ip-ingress-protection-d_452.html), which tells you exactly how waterproof and dustproof a speaker is.\n  *  **Price:** Even though we would like to test every type of portable Bluetooth speaker, we set a bottom price of $15. Bluetooth speakers are often available for as little as $5, but we\u2019ve never found such an inexpensive model to sound good enough to bother using\u2014especially when the speakers built into today\u2019s better phones can play loud enough for light listening.\n  *  **Playback controls:** Because playback can be controlled from your Bluetooth source device (usually a phone or tablet), we didn\u2019t require the speaker itself to have playback controls, but it\u2019s a convenient plus.\n  *  **Special features:** Bluetooth speakers offer all sorts of features beyond the ability to play audio from Bluetooth-sourced devices. These include speakerphone capability, pairing (the ability to play the same material through two Bluetooth speakers at once), built-in lighting, and even integral bottle openers. In polls and comments, every reader seems to have their own opinion as to which (if any) features are the most important, so we didn\u2019t require any particular features when picking products to test.\n\nAfter considering all of the criteria, we ended up evaluating 35 new models\nfor the most recent update, including recent releases from 1More, Anker,\nAudioengine, Doss, EarFun, Heyday, Harman Kardon, JBL, Kew Labs, LG, House of\nMarley, Marshall, Monoprice, Sony, Tribit, Tronsmart, UE, VicTsing, and Vifa.\nThis brings us to a total of about 270 Bluetooth speakers that we\u2019ve tested\nsince this guide first posted.\n\n## How we tested\n\n![Five of the portable bluetooth speakers we recommend sitting on top of and\nnext to a red and white hard-sided cooler.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/bluetooth-speakers-2019-lowres-4843-120x80.jpg) Our\ntop picks, left to right: EcoXGear EcoBoulder+, Sony SRS-XB32, Tribit XSound\nGo, UE Wonderboom 2, and JBL Xtreme 2. Photo: Rozette Rago\n\nAs has become my standard practice for updates to this guide, I started by\ngiving all of the new models a long listen, connecting them via Bluetooth\nthrough my Samsung Galaxy S9 phone and playing the same four test tracks: pop,\nheavy metal, hip-hop, and jazz. I compared the speakers not only with each\nother but also with some of our previous picks.\n\nI measured the maximum output of each speaker at a distance of 1 meter using\nan NTi Minilyzer audio analyzer and a calibrated NTi MiniSPL test microphone.\nFor this round of testing, I made one change from our past testing method\nbecause I noticed that my previous methods didn\u2019t seem to accurately reflect\nthe perceived maximum volume level in the speakers I tested. I speculate that\nthis is due to the increasing sophistication of the internal limiters that\nprotect the speaker drivers and minimize distortion. So instead of simply\nplaying [pink noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZEFb6Zi3sI) and noting\nthe maximum decibel level on the audio analyzer, I used the analyzer\u2019s Leq\nmode, measuring the average maximum level when playing ZZ Top\u2019s very loudly\nrecorded tune \u201cChartreuse.\u201d Sometimes the result was a little higher than in\nprevious tests, sometimes a little lower, but I think this approach will\ndeliver a result that better reflects what you\u2019ll hear in day-to-day use.\n\nI narrowed the contestants to the models that I thought had a real chance to\nimpress our listening panel, and I included a couple of past picks.\n\nAlthough my personal audio tests were, by necessity, sighted (that is, I\nalways knew which product I was hearing), I used a screen of thin black fabric\nto hide the identities of the products from the panelists. I first set the\nplayback level of each speaker to 74 decibels, using the shaped-noise channel-\nbalancing test tone recorded from a Dolby Digital receiver. Because of the\nwidely varying performance, the coarse volume control steps, and the\nunpredictable actions of the volume limiters used in these speakers, it was\nimpossible to match levels accurately, but in most cases I was able to get\nthem within plus/minus 0.3 dB.\n\nI played each panelist a mix of tracks known to be good tests of audio\nquality, such as Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201cFast Car,\u201d as well as a couple of tracks of\ntheir own choosing. I concluded the test of each speaker by cranking it up as\nloud as it would go and playing a rock track, such as AC/DC\u2019s \u201cHighway to\nHell.\u201d We started with smaller models and moved up to larger ones, and I\nchanged the order of presentation for each panelist.\n\nI asked the panelists to note which speakers they liked best, paying\nparticular attention to:\n\n  * how clear they sounded at normal levels\n  * the balance of bass to midrange to treble\n  * how loud they were able to play when cranked up\n  * how clear they sounded when cranked up\n\nAfter the listeners gave me their opinions of the sound, I unveiled the\nspeakers and got their comments about design, features, and price.\n\nI checked the battery life of each of our top picks by repeating Steely Dan\u2019s\n\u201cAja\u201d at an average level of 75 decibels (measured at 1 meter), over and over\nuntil the power ran out. Note that our results may not agree with the\nmanufacturers\u2019 stated battery life, likely because their testing\nmethodology\u2014which they almost never publish\u2014varies from ours. I also measured\nmaximum Bluetooth range of all our picks.\n\nFor models that offer speakerphone functionality, I tried placing a call with\neach model to Lauren, who has helped me evaluate speakerphone quality for\nyears. I speak to her from the same place in my living room, starting with my\nmouth 2 feet from the speaker; then I note how she sounds to me, and she tells\nme how my voice sounds.\n\n## Our pick: UE Wonderboom 2\n\n![The UE Wonderboom 2 portable speaker in red, sitting on the white lid of a\nhard-sided cooler.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/bluetooth-speakers-2019-lowres-4865-120x80.jpg) Photo:\nRozette Rago\n\n#### Our pick\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34559/156816/4/101008?merchant=Best%20Buy)\n\n### [UE Wonderboom\n2](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34559/156816/4/101008?merchant=Best%20Buy\n\"UE Wonderboom 2\")\n\n## [The best portable bluetooth\nspeaker](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34559/156816/4/101008?merchant=Best%20Buy\n\"The best portable bluetooth speaker\")\n\nThe Wonderboom 2 has a natural sound and a cool design, and it\u2019s built to\nsurvive almost any outdoor adventure.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$100* from Best\nBuy](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34559/156816/4/101008?merchant=Best%20Buy)\n\n[$70 from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34559/156465/4/101008?merchant=Amazon)\n\nMay be out of stock\n\n*At the time of publishing, the price was $92.\n\nA portable Bluetooth speaker should be compact, rugged, affordable, and (most\nof all) good-sounding. The [UE Wonderboom\n2](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34559/156465/4/101034/?merchant=Amazon)\nticks all of these boxes and then some. Three of our four panelists considered\nthis model\u2019s sound to be the best of any speaker we tested under $100, and\nthey praised its natural balance of bass to midrange to treble, as well as its\nclear reproduction of voices. The Wonderboom 2 is about the size and weight of\na large apple, so it\u2019s easy to carry around. It also has lots of useful\nfeatures, including an Outdoor Boost mode that makes it louder (at the expense\nof bass), an ultra-rugged design, stereo/mono pairing, an extra-long Bluetooth\nrange, and a top button that lets you pause and restart the music, as well as\nskip to the next track.\n\n\u201cThe sound is surprisingly clear for such a small speaker,\u201d Sammy said. \u201cIt\u2019s\nthe best of the under-$100 models, and definitely the best overall when you\nconsider price.\u201d Lauren added: \u201cIt sounds bright, but it\u2019s got enough bass to\nbalance that out\u2014it\u2019s boom and sizzle, where most of the small speakers are\nall sizzle.\u201d\n\nWith an IP67 rating, the Wonderboom 2 is dustproof and waterproof, and it can\nbe submerged in up to 1 meter of water for a half-hour. It also floats, so you\nwon\u2019t lose it if you drop it off a boat or dock or into a swimming pool. UE\nsays the Wonderboom 2 can withstand a 5-foot drop; we confirmed this by\ndropping it from 5 feet, first onto a hardwood floor and then onto concrete.\nNot only did it keep working, but it barely even showed a scuff mark. A small,\nelasticized strap on top lets you hang the Wonderboom 2 from a shower rod,\ntent pole, or other object, provided you have a carabiner, a hook, or a strand\nof string to attach it.\n\nIn our measurements, the Wonderboom 2 put out 84.6 dB at 1 meter, about the\nsame level you\u2019d hear from the traffic noise if you were standing at a busy\ncity intersection\u2014and enough to fill a small room with sound. The Outdoor\nBoost mode increased this by about 3 dB\u2014that\u2019s not a dramatic boost, but it is\nnoticeably louder. However, this mode reduces bass, so the speaker doesn\u2019t\nsound as full and pleasing. Bluetooth range measured an impressive 95 feet\nthrough one window.\n\n## Flaws but not dealbreakers\n\nIf you like lots of bass, this probably isn\u2019t your speaker. I was the only\npanelist who didn\u2019t rank the Wonderboom 2 as the best speaker under $100\nbecause I was bothered to hear its little speaker drivers choking on some of\nthe deep bass notes in my favorite jazz and pop recordings. If you prefer a\nbit more bass, the larger (and pricier) Sony SRS-XB32 may be more to your\nliking.\n\nThe Wonderboom 2 lacks a speakerphone function. We wouldn\u2019t use this feature\noften, but you might.\n\nBattery life is rated at 13 hours, but we measured roughly eight hours, and\nthat\u2019s with four trials of two different units, with the Outdoor Boost mode\ndisengaged. That\u2019s adequate to cover a full workday, but there won\u2019t be any\nreserve to save you if you forget to keep it charged.\n\nFinally, though the Wonderboom 2 is light and compact, it\u2019s not slim. Its\ncylindrical design, measuring about 3\u00bd inches in diameter and 4 inches high,\ntakes up more space in a suitcase than some slimmer designs and prevents it\nfrom fitting comfortably in a laptop bag.\n\n## Upgrade pick: JBL Xtreme 2\n\n![The JBL Xtreme 2 speaker in hunter green, sitting on a cooler\nlid.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bluetooth-\nspeakers-2019-lowres-4857-120x80.jpg) Photo: Rozette Rago\n\n#### Upgrade pick\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34560/156466/4/101009?merchant=Amazon)\n\n### [JBL Xtreme\n2](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34560/156466/4/101009?merchant=Amazon\n\"JBL Xtreme 2\")\n\n## [The best sounding bluetooth\nspeaker](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34560/156466/4/101009?merchant=Amazon\n\"The best sounding bluetooth speaker\")\n\nThe Xtreme 2 easily fills a large room (or a small parking lot) with\nsatisfying sound, and its rugged, waterproof design makes it trunk-friendly.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$192* from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34560/156466/4/101009?merchant=Amazon)\n\n[$350 from Best\nBuy](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34560/156817/4/101009?merchant=Best%20Buy)\n\n*At the time of publishing, the price was $250.\n\nThe [JBL Xtreme\n2](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34560/156466/4/101035/?merchant=Amazon)\nis easily one of the best portable Bluetooth speakers we\u2019ve heard, with a big,\nfull sound that approaches the quality of what you might hear from a good\ncompact stereo system. Three of our four panelists considered it to be the\nbest of all the speakers we tested in this (and probably every) round. The\nXtreme 2 is a good bit bigger and heavier than the UE Wonderboom 2 and the\nSony SRS-XB32, but its detachable shoulder strap makes it easy to carry to the\nbeach or park. Because the Xtreme 2 carries an IPX7 rating, it can easily\nsurvive rogue waves or unexpected downpours.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only one that had enough bass to sound good on Kanye West\u2019s \u2018Love\nLockdown,\u2019 \u201d Lauren said. \u201cIt has a 3D, spacious quality to the sound. Male\nvoices sounded good, although the sound is a little bright, so it makes female\nvoices sound a little harsh.\u201d Sammy and I had similar comments; only Dan\ndemurred, saying the bass was too pumped-up for his taste.\n\nAt 11\u00bd inches long by 5 inches in diameter, with a weight of 5.4 pounds (more\nthan four pounds heavier than the Wonderboom 2), the Xtreme 2 isn\u2019t especially\ncompact, and it definitely isn\u2019t light\u2014but thanks to its thick canvas shoulder\nstrap, it\u2019s easy to lug around. The strap even has a bottle opener built into\nits buckle.\n\nAlthough the Xtreme 2 put out a relatively modest 89.9 dB at 1 meter in our\ntests, it seems far louder because the sound is so full and the bass really\nkicks. Battery life is rated at 15 hours, and we measured 19 hours in our\ntests. Bluetooth range measured an impressive 110 feet through one window.\n\n![Closeup of the buttons on the JBL Xtreme 2 speaker, and with it's cross-body\ntravel strap attached.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/bluetooth-speakers-2019-lowres-4862-120x80.jpg) The\nXtreme 2 is larger and heavier than our UE and Sony picks, but the included\nshoulder strap makes it easier to carry around. Photo: Rozette Rago\n\nThere\u2019s a speakerphone function\u2014when I called Lauren, she described my voice\nas sounding \u201cclear, but a little compressed,\u201d but her voice sounded great on\nmy end of the call. The Connect+ function lets you connect up to 100 Connect+\nspeakers together for mass playback (although that\u2019s 98 speakers more than\nmost people would probably want to connect). The play button on top lets you\npause and restart playback and skip to the next track.\n\nThe Xtreme 2 has two real downsides. The first is that it\u2019s expensive\u2014about\ntwice the current price of our previous upgrade pick, the [Sony SRS-\nXB41](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29408/149371/4/84394/?merchant=Amazon).\nBut three of our four panelists greatly preferred the sound of the Xtreme 2,\nso for listeners who want a very loud, clear, and full-sounding speaker, we\nexpect it\u2019ll be worth the extra cost.\n\nThe second downside to the Xtreme 2 is that it charges only through a separate\nAC adapter, which of course you\u2019ll have to remember to bring with you if you\nwant to play it for more than 19 hours. A speaker this big and powerful would\ncharge much too slowly through a Micro-USB cable, but we wonder if switching\nto USB-C (as so many other Bluetooth speakers have done) might have been\npreferable.\n\n## Also great: Sony SRS-XB32\n\n![The Sony SRS-XB32 bluetooth speaker in dark\nblue.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bluetooth-\nspeakers-2019-lowres-4876-120x80.jpg) Photo: Rozette Rago\n\n#### Also great\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34561/156467/4/101010?merchant=Amazon)\n\n### [Sony SRS-\nXB32](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34561/156467/4/101010?merchant=Amazon\n\"Sony SRS-XB32\")\n\n## [The midsize sedan of portable BT\nspeakers](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34561/156467/4/101010?merchant=Amazon\n\"The midsize sedan of portable BT speakers\")\n\nThe SRS-XB32 has a respectably big, full sound, with a rugged design and lots\nof features.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$96* from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34561/156467/4/101010?merchant=Amazon)\n\n[$150 from Best\nBuy](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34561/156818/4/101010?merchant=Best%20Buy)\n\n*At the time of publishing, the price was $0.\n\nThe [Sony SRS-\nXB32](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34561/156467/4/101036/?merchant=Amazon)\nis the speaker to get when you need a bit more speaker than the UE Wonderboom\n2 but not as much speaker as the JBL Xtreme 2. It\u2019s about twice the size and\nweight of the Wonderboom 2 (and a notable step up in price), but it has a\nfuller, bassier sound that would make it a reasonable substitute for a small\nstereo system\u2014and a better choice for use in a dorm room or bedroom. The SRS-\nXB32 also has a variety of features that we expect some listeners will think\nare awesome and others will think are silly.\n\n\u201cOverall, this one sounds very good,\u201d Dan said. \u201cThe sound is well balanced\nbetween bass and treble, and it never sounds nasty, as some of these speakers\ndid.\u201d Lauren, Sammy, and I generally shared Dan\u2019s sentiment: The SRS-XB32\nwon\u2019t make you forget you\u2019re listening to a compact Bluetooth speaker, but\nit\u2019s satisfying for casual listening at home, small backyard gatherings, and\nsharing tunes with a few friends at the beach. The Extra Bass button lets you\npunch up the lows when you put on hip-hop, heavy metal, or taiko drum\nrecitals.\n\nThe SRS-XB32 measures 9.3 by 3.1 by 3.2 inches and weighs 2 pounds\u2014that\u2019s a\nlittle too big to toss into a suitcase without a second thought, but small\nenough to toss into a car trunk or beach bag. Because it\u2019s IP67-rated, it\u2019s\ndustproof and waterproof, so there\u2019s no need to worry if it encounters sand,\nsplashes, or rain.\n\nLike some of Sony\u2019s other portable Bluetooth speakers, the SRS-XB32 has\nmulticolored lighting that can be adjusted through a smartphone app. We\u2019re not\nparticularly fond of this feature, but if you like this sort of thing, then\nyou\u2019ll like this sort of thing. The SRS-XB32 also includes Sony\u2019s Party\nBooster feature, which produces various percussion sounds when you slap the\nspeaker on the front, sides, top, or bottom. I can\u2019t imagine what kind of\nparty might be enlivened by this feature, although I can attest that the\nsounds will stop a misbehaving shih tzu from doing whatever she\u2019s doing.\n\nBattery life is rated at 24 hours with Extra Bass off and 14 hours with Extra\nBass on, but for us the battery life didn\u2019t come close to Sony\u2019s ratings. Even\nwith Extra Bass off, the SRS-XB32 ran for only six hours before it\nautomatically reduced its level to preserve battery life; it lasted another\nfive hours after that. We saw this same behavior in the SRS-XB32\u2019s\npredecessor, the SRS-XB31, but unlike the SRS-XB31, the SRS-XB32 is still\nusable when it reduces its volume. So the SRS-XB32 will probably last through\na day at the beach, but don\u2019t forget to charge it when you\u2019re done listening.\n\nAt full blast, the SRS-XB32 puts out 87.4 dB at 1 meter. That\u2019s almost 3 dB\nmore than the Wonderboom 2, but the Sony\u2019s fuller sound makes it seem even\nlouder. Bluetooth range measured about 50 feet through one window. You can\nconnect up to 100 compatible Sony wireless speakers for synchronized playback.\nYou can even sync the lights. The play and pause button on top lets you pause\nand restart playback and skip to the next track. When we tested the\nspeakerphone function, Lauren reported that my voice sounded fairly clear and\nnatural, but her voice sounded like she was speaking into a disposable plastic\ncup.\n\n## Budget pick: Tribit XSound Go\n\n![The Tribit XSound Go speaker in black.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/bluetooth-speakers-2019-lowres-4885-120x80.jpg) Photo:\nRozette Rago\n\n#### Budget pick\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24284/130004/4/101011?merchant=Amazon)\n\n### [Tribit XSound\nGo](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24284/130004/4/101011?merchant=Amazon\n\"Tribit XSound Go\")\n\n## [Very good sound for under\n$35](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24284/130004/4/101011?merchant=Amazon\n\"Very good sound for under $35\")\n\nThe Tribit XSound Go is the best speaker we\u2019ve heard in its price range, and\nit\u2019s compact and waterproof to boot.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$30* from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24284/130004/4/101011?merchant=Amazon)\n\n*At the time of publishing, the price was $33.\n\nIf you want a great all-around portable Bluetooth speaker for about the cost\nof a tank of gas, the [Tribit XSound\nGo](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24284/130004/4/69616/?merchant=Amazon)\nis a terrific choice. Sonically, it\u2019s a step up from anything else we\u2019ve heard\nin this price range, with clearer sound and more bass than most competitors\ncan muster. This speaker is easy to travel with, too\u2014it\u2019s small enough to slip\ninto a laptop bag or any suitcase. Plus, it\u2019s IPX7-rated, which means it\u2019s\nsufficiently waterproof to survive a half-hour swim in 1 meter of water.\n\nWhen the XSound Go accompanied me through four weeks of travel, I continued to\nbe surprised by how clear and full its sound was. Voices sound natural and\ndistinct, never bloated or hoarse, as they can through most inexpensive\nBluetooth speakers. The XSound Go doesn\u2019t sound as full or play as loud as the\nWonderboom 2, but all of the panelists thought it delivered amazing sound\nquality for its price. Measured maximum volume was 82.4 dB\u2014not enough to get a\nparty going, but enough for light listening in a typical living room.\n\n![Closeup on the buttons on the top of the Tribit XSound Go\nspeaker.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/portable-\nbluetooth-speakers-lowres-1817-120x80.jpg) The XSound Go has play/pause and\nvolume buttons, but it lacks track-skip controls. Photo: Kyle Fitzgerald\n\nThere\u2019s nothing flashy about the XSound Go, but it doesn\u2019t have that cheap,\nplasticky look that many budget Bluetooth speakers have. Although it has a\nplay/pause button on the top, it doesn\u2019t have track-skip buttons, which would\ncome in handy if you used the XSound Go in the shower. The battery is rated\nfor 24 hours of life; we got only about 10\u00bd hours, but for a cheap Bluetooth\nspeaker, that\u2019s fine.\n\nThe XSound Go\u2019s speakerphone function is good, especially for the price. I\ncould hear Lauren very clearly, although she complained that my voice sounded\nslightly muffled. In our tests, Bluetooth range was about 25 feet through one\nwall, which is good for a speaker of this size.\n\n## Also great: EcoXGear EcoBoulder+\n\n![The ExoXGear EcoBoulder+ speaker.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/bluetooth-speakers-2019-lowres-4890-120x80.jpg) Photo:\nRozette Rago\n\n#### Also great\n\n[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24285/154683/4/101012?merchant=Cabela's)\n\n### [EcoXGear\nEcoBoulder+](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24285/154683/4/101012?merchant=Cabela's\n\"EcoXGear EcoBoulder+\")\n\n## [For pool parties and\ntailgating](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24285/154683/4/101012?merchant=Cabela's\n\"For pool parties and tailgating\")\n\nThe EcoBoulder+ plays amazingly loud, sounds very good, is built to survive\nthe outdoors, and also opens bottles.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n[$200 from\nCabela's](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24285/154683/4/101012?merchant=Cabela's)\n\n[Buy from\nAmazon](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24285/130005/4/101012?merchant=Amazon)\n\nAbout two years ago, the \u201cpool blaster\u201d Bluetooth speaker category emerged:\nlarge models that have high volume levels and a waterproof design. Many people\nwould love having a speaker like this for pool parties or tailgating, but the\n[EcoXGear\nEcoBoulder+](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24285/130005/4/69617/?merchant=Amazon)\nis the first we\u2019ve found that delivers the combination of volume and sound\nquality we\u2019d been hoping for\u2014at a price that\u2019s typically $100 to $150 less\nthan that of many competing models.\n\nThis is easily the best-sounding pool blaster we\u2019ve heard to date, with an\neven balance of bass, midrange, and treble that presents all instruments and\nvocalists naturally without calling attention to (or mangling) any one element\nof the music. The EcoBoulder+ is built much like a good home stereo speaker,\nwith an 8-inch woofer below a 3-inch tweeter, and an 8-inch passive radiator\nin the back to reinforce the bass. The big speaker drivers and the built-in\namp rated at 100 watts allowed the EcoBoulder+ to hit 104.1 dB in our tests,\nabout 14 dB louder than the JBL Xtreme 2. That\u2019s loud enough to cover a\ntypical suburban backyard. If the sound isn\u2019t quite to your liking, bass and\ntreble controls let you fine-tune it, but we never felt the need.\n\nWith wheels and a retractable handle, the EcoBoulder+ scoots around as easily\nas a roll-aboard suitcase. Video: Kyle Fitzgerald\n\nThe EcoBoulder+ is also easy to cart around. With a retractable handle and\nbuilt-in wheels, it scoots around just like a roll-aboard suitcase. Sturdy\nhandles on top allow two-handed lifting. It\u2019s IP67-rated, which means it\u2019s\nwaterproof and dustproof, and it also has a waterproof pocket on the side for\na smartphone. A bottle opener on the side and two cupholders on top facilitate\nconsumption of beer or a bottle of Mexican Coca-Cola. This model also has a\nbuilt-in AM/FM radio, so tailgaters can listen to the game. A \u00bc-inch jack on\nthe speaker\u2019s side lets you connect a microphone (not included), so you can\nuse the EcoBoulder+ as a little PA system. In the unlikely event that you need\nmore volume, you can pair two EcoBoulder+ speakers for stereo sound.\n\nSurprisingly, the EcoBoulder+ even has a speakerphone function, so if you ever\nneed to do a conference call with 30 people while sitting poolside at a\nFlorida resort, you\u2019re good to go. Even more surprisingly, the speakerphone\nfunction is one of the best we\u2019ve tested, with excellent voice quality at both\nends.\n\n  * ![A person pulling out the waterproof phone/gear pouch component of the EcoXGear EcoBoulder+ speaker.](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/portable-bluetooth-speakers-lowres-1848-200x134.jpg)\n\nThe EcoBoulder+ has many convenient features, including a waterproof pouch for\nyour phone.

Considering that few people will buy the\nEcoBoulder+ to play music at normal indoor levels, we ran our battery-life\ntest with the volume set 6 dB louder than we did with the other models we\ntested (which in a normal living room sounds pretty loud). Even at this higher\nvolume, the EcoBoulder+ ran for 24 hours on a charge. Bluetooth range in our\ntests was about 43 feet through one wall, enough that you could probably leave\nyour phone indoors while the EcoBoulder+ played out by the pool.\n\nOne panelist summed up the EcoBoulder+ nicely when he said, \u201cThey obviously\ntook a hard look at what a person wanting a speaker like this would need, and\nthey put it all in there.

The same goes for the [OontZ Angle 3\nUltra](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29863/149953/4/84397/?merchant=Amazon).\n\nThe [Crosley Charlotte\nCR3028A](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/36565/158973/4/108844/?merchant=Amazon)\nhas an appealing retro style, but it has mediocre Amazon reviews, with\ncomplaints about weak sound quality and insufficient volume.\n\nWith a built-in MP3 player and MicroSD card slot, plus a USB input, the\n[Creative Sound Blaster\nFree](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/5616/15983/4/44927/?merchant=Amazon)\nis a nice speaker for its price, but we think our top picks sound better.\n\nThe [Creative iRoar\nGo](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/18776/97205/4/44928/?merchant=Amazon)\ndidn\u2019t please our panelists; two complained about a buzzy sound in the\nmidrange and some distortion in the bass.\n\nThe [Doss SoundBox\nTouch](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/18758/97107/4/71110/?merchant=Amazon)\nis our former pick for best budget Bluetooth speaker, but the Tribit XSound Go\ndelivers comparable sound in a smaller chassis.\n\nThe [Doss\nTraveler](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24874/132760/4/71111/?merchant=Amazon)\nis a campsite-friendly speaker with integral LED flashlights. It plays clear\nand loud, but our panelists liked the Tribit XSound Go better.\n\nThe [Doss SoundBox\nPro](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29864/149954/4/84398/?merchant=Amazon)\ndoesn\u2019t really sound better than the Tribit XSound Go, and it\u2019s larger and\ncostlier.\n\nWe found the sound of the [Doss SoundBox\nPlus](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34762/156772/4/101046/?merchant=Amazon)\nthin and unpleasant, especially on voices.\n\nThe [EarFun\nGo](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34763/156773/4/101047/?merchant=Amazon)\nis similar in size, design, quality, and price to the Tribit XSound Go. Our\npanelists had a slight preference for the XSound Go, but either is a good buy.\n\nTwo of our panelists praised the [EarFun\nUBOOM](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34764/156774/4/101048/?merchant=Amazon)\nfor its clear and balanced sound, but two panelists thought its clarity was\nlacking.\n\nThe [Edifier\nMP200](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24875/132766/4/71112/?merchant=Amazon)\nis a cute, cube-shaped speaker that sounds good but doesn\u2019t play as loud as\nsome competitors, and it scoots around a bit when playing music with a lot of\nbass.\n\nThe [Edifier\nMP700](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/15147/43889/4/44940/?merchant=Amazon)\nsounded impressively clear, but it didn\u2019t play as loud as we\u2019d hoped for its\nsize, and its metal handle made it heavy to lug around.\n\nOur panelists thought the [Fender\nNewport](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24876/132773/4/71113/?merchant=Amazon)\nsounded great, but it\u2019s not convenient for portable use. If you like the\nNewport\u2019s guitar-amp styling, we strongly recommend it.\n\nThe [Harman Kardon Onyx\nMini](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29865/149955/4/84399/?merchant=Best%20Buy)\nhas a generally pleasant, fairly full sound, but our panelists thought its\nsound on bass-heavy music was distorted and indistinct.\n\nWe liked the full, clear sound of the [Harman Kardon Onyx Studio\n4](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34765/156775/4/101049/?merchant=Amazon).\nAnd even though its rechargeable battery and integral handle make it\ntechnically portable, it\u2019s large enough that you probably wouldn\u2019t want to\ncarry it much farther than the backyard.\n\nThe [Heyday Square Portable Bluetooth\nSpeaker](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34766/156776/4/101050/?merchant=Target)\nhas almost no bass.\n\nThe [iHome\niBT374](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24877/132778/4/71114/?merchant=Amazon)\nis nicely priced for the volume and bass it delivers, but our panelists\nthought the unit\u2019s strong bass and treble overshadowed vocals.\n\nThe [Jam Hang\nAround](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29866/149956/4/84400/?merchant=Amazon)\nand [Jam Hang\nTight](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29867/149957/4/84401/?merchant=Amazon)\nare beautifully designed, affordable waterproof speakers with cool integral\ncharging cords, but their sound distorted too often for our taste.\n\nOur panelists thought the [JBL Charge\n4](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34767/156777/4/101051/?merchant=Amazon)\u2019s\nbass sounded too dull and boomy.\n\nThe [JBL Clip\n3](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29868/149958/4/84402/?merchant=Amazon)\nis a nice, ruggedly designed small speaker, but our panelists didn\u2019t like its\nnear-total lack of bass. And this model\u2019s small integral clip makes it hard to\nhang off of most objects.\n\nJBL\u2019s Flip Bluetooth speakers are practical, powerful, and reasonably priced.\nBut as with past Flips, our panelists thought the [JBL Flip\n4](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24879/132785/4/71116/?merchant=Amazon)\nsounded too thin and needed more bass.\n\nThe [JBL Flip\n5](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34768/156778/4/101052/?merchant=Amazon)\ncame very close to being a top pick\u2014it falls between the UE Wonderboom 2 and\nthe Sony SRS-XB32 in price and performance. Our panelists thought it sounded a\ntad bright but very good overall. However, we got only about six hours of\nbattery life from it.\n\nA cute design and built-in lights make the [JBL Jr\nPOP](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34769/156779/4/101053/?merchant=Amazon)\nan appealing choice for kids; it sounds clear but has less bass than most\nother speakers in its price range.\n\nThe [JLab Crasher\nMini](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/15150/43900/4/44960/?merchant=Amazon)\nsounded surprisingly full for its size, but our test sample soon started\ndistorting badly.\n\nThe [JLab Crasher\nXL](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/16723/50809/4/44962/?merchant=Amazon)\nis a good choice if you want something larger and more powerful than the UE\nWonderboom 2 for about the same price; our panelists generally liked the\nCrasher XL\u2019s loud, full sound.\n\nThe [Kew Labs\nK1](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34770/156780/4/101054/?merchant=Amazon)\ntends to sound blaring and garbled when playing hip-hop and heavy rock.\n\nThe [Kicker Bullfrog\nBF400](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/18781/97226/4/44964/?merchant=Amazon)\nhas a great design for outdoor use, but even though it sounds good at lower\nvolume, it distorted too much for us at high volume.\n\nThe [Kicker Bullfrog\nBF200](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24881/132800/4/71118/?merchant=Amazon)\nis a smaller version of the original Bullfrog. It might have been our top pick\nin a \u201cpool blaster\u201d had we not found the much more powerful and less expensive\n(but much bulkier) EcoXGear EcoBoulder+.\n\nThe [LG\nPK7](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34771/156781/4/101055/?merchant=Amazon)\nsounds very clear, clean, and balanced, but despite its large size, it doesn\u2019t\nplay loud enough to fill a bedroom.\n\nWe considered the [Libratone One\nClick](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/15152/43908/4/44967/?merchant=Amazon)\nas a top pick because it plays pretty loud and has a beautiful design, but it\nsounds a little too trebly to us.\n\nThe [Libratone\nToo](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/16813/51191/4/44968/?merchant=Amazon)\nsounds very clear and natural and has a beautiful design, but we don\u2019t think\nit plays loud enough for the price.\n\nWe liked the full sound and compact design of the [House of Marley No\nBounds](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29869/149959/4/84403/?merchant=Amazon),\nbut deep bass makes it rattle across whatever it\u2019s sitting on.\n\nWe considered making the [House of Marley No Bounds\nSport](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29870/149960/4/84404/?merchant=Amazon)\na pick because we love the design, and the sound is good for the price, but we\ngot only about six hours of run time.\n\nUnlike almost all other portable Bluetooth speakers, the [House of Marley No\nBounds\nXL](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34772/156782/4/101058/?merchant=Amazon)\nsounds pretty good cranked up, but at lower volumes the bass seems to obscure\nvocals and guitars.\n\nThe [Marshall Kilburn\nII](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34773/156783/4/101059/?merchant=Amazon)\ntends to clamp down the volume abruptly when it hits a deep bass note, and\nvoices have a sort of canned quality.\n\nI loved the clarity of voices and instruments with the [Marshall Stockwell\nII](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34774/156784/4/101060/?merchant=Amazon),\nbut our other panelists thought it should deliver more bass and more volume\nfor the price.\n\nThe [Monoprice Deep Blue\nSub710](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24883/132804/4/71120/?merchant=Amazon)\nputs out a lot of volume for the price, but our panelists thought it needed a\nlittle more bass and a fuller sound.\n\nMy Samsung Galaxy S9 on its own had higher measured output than the [Monoprice\nDeep Blue\nSub75](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34775/156785/4/101061/?merchant=Amazon).\n\nThe [Monoprice Harmony\nCapsule](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29872/149962/4/84406/?merchant=Amazon)\nhas good sound quality for its size, but it\u2019s bulkier than the Wonderboom 2,\nand we got only about 6\u00bd hours of battery life from it.\n\nThe [Monoprice Harmony\nXL](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29873/149963/4/84407/?merchant=Amazon)\ndelivers powerful sound for the price, and it would make a great office\nspeaker, but its bulk and non-waterproof design make it less practical for\nportable use.\n\nThe [Nyne\nBass](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/87/259/4/44976/?merchant=Amazon)\nwas a previous pick for its ratio of dollars to decibels, but many newer\nspeakers sound better.\n\nOur panelists thought the [Nyne\nBoost](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29874/149964/4/84408/?merchant=Amazon)\nsounded tinny and needed more bass.\n\nThe tiny [Polk Boom\nBit](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/16724/50811/4/44979/?merchant=Amazon)\nis one of the most flexible and useful Bluetooth speakers ever. We love it for\nhiking, but its three-hour battery life limits its utility.\n\nOur panelists thought the [Sbode\nM400](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29876/149966/4/84410/?merchant=Amazon)\nsounded pretty good, but that it didn\u2019t play loud enough.\n\nThe [Scosche BoomBottle\nMM](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29877/149967/4/84411/?merchant=Amazon)\nhas a nice, very rugged design, but our panelists thought it sounded shrill.\n\nWe like the cool, fold-out design of the [Sony GTK-\nPG10](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34776/156786/4/101062/?merchant=Amazon),\nbut we think the EcoXGear EcoBoulder+ sounds better, and it\u2019s more waterproof.\n\nEven with the Extra Bass button engaged, the [Sony SRS-\nXB22](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34777/156787/4/101063/?merchant=Amazon)\ndidn\u2019t have enough bass for us, and voices sounded rather coarse.\n\nAlthough the [Soundcast\nVG1](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/16725/50814/4/45000/?merchant=Amazon)\nsounds very clean and clear, it doesn\u2019t play particularly loud for its price.\n\nThe [Tribit MaxSound\nPlus](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34778/156788/4/101064/?merchant=Amazon)\nis a good-sounding, affordable speaker that falls between the UE Wonderboom 2\nand the Tribit XSound Go in price and performance. If we had more picks, this\nmight be one.\n\nWe didn\u2019t like the [Tribit\nStormBox](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29407/149370/4/101065/?merchant=Amazon)\nas much as its predecessor, the 360\u00b0 Sound Speaker (which was our former top\npick), because we thought its sound seemed brighter and more sibilant than the\nprevious model we tested.\n\nThe [Tronsmart\nForce](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34779/156789/4/101066/?merchant=Amazon)\ndidn\u2019t put out enough bass for our panelists.\n\nWe think that, for its size, the [Tronsmart Element\nT6](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34780/156790/4/101067/?merchant=Amazon)\nshould have more bass; it tends to sound blaring and harsh.\n\nThe [UE Boom\n3](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/29880/149970/4/84414/?merchant=Amazon)\nsounds good, plays loud, and has lots of great features, but our panelists\nprefer a little more bass for the price.\n\nOur panelists really liked the [UE Megaboom\n3](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/28072/147096/4/84416/?merchant=Amazon)\nfor its features and rugged design, but they preferred the fuller sound of the\nSony SRS-XB41 and JBL Xtreme 2.\n\nThe [Urbanears\nR\u00e5lis](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34781/156791/4/101068/?merchant=Urbanears)\nsounded too bassy for our taste, and it didn\u2019t play especially loud for its\nsize.\n\nThe hockey-puck-sized [VicTsing SoundHot\nC6](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34782/156792/4/101069/?merchant=Amazon)\ndoesn\u2019t play real loud, but it does sound good. And its detachable suction cup\nand IPX5 rating make it a good, cheap shower speaker.\n\nThe [Vifa\nCity](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/34783/156793/4/101070/?merchant=Vifa)\nis small and stylish, but it compressed the sound heavily when we played hip-\nhop and heavy rock tracks.\n\nWe can\u2019t pick the [Vifa\nOslo](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/15172/44029/4/45018/?merchant=Amazon)\nbecause few people want to spend $450 (its price at the time of writing) for a\nportable speaker. But it plays loud and has a wonderfully full, clear sound.\n\nThe [V-Moda\nRemix](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/18765/97157/4/44879/?merchant=Amazon)\nis an elegantly designed speaker, but it\u2019s very pricey for the sound quality\noffered.\n\n## About your guide\n\n![Brent Butterworth](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2015/11/butterworth-brent.jpg)\n\nBrent Butterworth\n\n[](mailto:notes@wirecutter.com)[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brent-\nbutterworth-2086011/)\n\nBrent Butterworth is a senior staff writer covering audio and musical\ninstruments at Wirecutter.
