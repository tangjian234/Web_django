There are tons of waterproof Bluetooth speaker options out\nthere\u2014in various sizes and at different price points\u2014that will cater to your\nlifestyle and needs. If you're wanting to jam out on your outdoor patio, you\nmight want to consider a larger, more durable waterproof speaker with a bit\nmore bass; however, if you're just looking for something that can back you up\nwhile singing in the shower, there are also more compact options that still\npack a great-sounding punch.\n\nSummer is an ideal time to pull the trigger on a waterproof speaker since\nyou're most likely spending more time outdoors (hey, they're perfect for\npicnics in the park, bike rides, kayaking, and more), a waterproof Bluetooth\nspeaker is a year-round tech staple (great for ski trips and camping, too)\nthat can hold up in the wettest conditions\u2014whether it's a dash of rain or snow\nor a splash from the pool.

A lot of sound comes out of this little speaker (I have the mini.) I\nkeep it in my jeep so I can use Bluetooth to listen to my phone playlist, BUT\nmore importantly, the calling functionality. People on the other end of the\nphone say I sound better through the mini\u2019s mic than through my phone's mic!\nWhat\u2019s really surprising is that in our frigid temps, leaving this in my mega-\ncold car 24/7 hasn\u2019t depleted the battery. I haven\u2019t charged my mini in over 6\nweeks and it still has lots of life left until next charge. Impressive little\ndevice.
