While a good pair of headphones will\naccomplish the same goal, speakers will let you share great music, movies, TV\nand video games with the rest of your household. They also never press down\nuncomfortably on your ears after a few hours, which is a plus.\n\nThere are a ton of different types of computer speakers and many different\nconfigurations, including two speakers, 2.1 units with a subwoofer and even\n5.1 systems for surround sound. Some of the best computer speakers are subtle\nand compact for smaller setups, while others offer striking designs with RGB\nlighting for gamers and creators.\n\nSome of the best computer speakers can be a great investment, particularly if\nyou have a laptop. While laptop speakers may be convenient, they tend to be\ntinny and quiet at the best of times, and downright distorted at the worst. A\nsolid pair of speakers can reveal instruments and harmonies that you've never\nheard in your favorite music, and new layers of depth for your favorite visual\nmedia. They don't have to cost a fortune, either, so check out the list for\nour favorites.\n\n  * Need something portable?

These speakers are small and lightweight, but they\nproduce a lot of balanced nuanced sound. The speakers aren't cheap, by any\nmeans, but since you're paying for Bose quality, you'll get what you pay for.\nYou don't get separate bass and treble controls, though, so audiophiles should\nbe aware of that potential shortcoming.\n\nGamers (especially those with some money to spend) should consider the\nLogitech G560 Gaming Speakers, which comprise two desktop speakers and a\nsubwoofer. You can customize elaborate lighting patterns, or let the speakers\ncome up with lighting patterns themselves, based on the game that you're\nplaying. The sound is rich and loud, and the bass is quite powerful.\n\nAt the other end of the price spectrum is the Logitech S120 2.0, which usually\nretails for $25 or less. These simple, no-nonsense speakers are small and\nbasic, but they provide a significant boost over a built-in laptop speaker \u2014\nor no speakers at all, if you've been using a desktop with headphones all this\ntime. They're probably the best computer speakers for people who have limited\naudio needs, but still want the option to play music and other multimedia out\nloud.\n\nThe other speakers in this list run the gamut from expensive, complicated\nsound systems to relatively simple desktop speakers. Generally speaking, you\nshould look to spend $50 or less for something straightforward, $100 to $150\nfor something robust and more than $150 for something with a lot of extra\nbells and whistles. It depends on how much of an audiophile you are.\n\n## The best computer speakers right now\n\n![Best computer speakers: Bose Companion 2 Series\nIII](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Bose)\n\n### Bose Companion 2 Series III\n\nThe best overall computer speakers\n\n **Type of system:** 2.0 | **Inputs:** Two 3.5mm inputs | **Size:** 7.5 x 5.9\nx 3.1 inches | **Watts:** N/A\n\nRecommended Retailer\n\n[$84.49](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=22837656539&a=103504&m=7168&clickref=tomsguide-\nus-8541810616904516000)\n\n[View at HP\n(US)](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=22837656539&a=103504&m=7168&clickref=tomsguide-\nus-9376969228769047000)\n\n[$89](https://imp.i114863.net/c/221109/794166/11319?prodsku=Comp2S3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FComp2S3\n--bose-companion-2-series-iii-multimedia-monitor-\nsystem&intsrc=CATF_5713&subId1=tomsguide-us-6105244268657590000)\n\n[View at Sweetwater\nSound](https://imp.i114863.net/c/221109/794166/11319?prodsku=Comp2S3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FComp2S3\n--bose-companion-2-series-iii-multimedia-monitor-\nsystem&intsrc=CATF_5713&subId1=tomsguide-us-4804009025519598000)\n\n[$99.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/221109/633495/10014?prodsku=8864513&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F8864513%2Fpdp&intsrc=CATF_4831&subId1=tomsguide-\nus-1015156463285609300)\n\n[View at Best\nBuy](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/221109/633495/10014?prodsku=8864513&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F8864513%2Fpdp&intsrc=CATF_4831&subId1=tomsguide-\nus-6312851760359241000)\n\n[See all prices (5\nfound)](https://www.tomsguide.com/deals/compare?model_name=Bose%20Companion%202%20Series%20III&filter_product_types=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback)\n\nBig bass, full sound\n\nLacks treble and bass controls\n\nThe Companion 2 Series III is among the best computer speakers for most\npeople. The 7.5 x 5.9 x 3.1-inch satellites don't take up much space on your\ndesk, but they create a big, full sound. The price won't break the bank, and\nit's worth the premium over cheaper units. Remember, too, that you're also\npaying for the brand name, and Bose generally doesn't come cheap. It produces\nmore bass than speakers twice the size, and with robust vocals and pleasing\ntreble, it delivers very good sound overall.\n\nThe simple and elegant design features a single volume knob on the right\nspeaker, along with a headphone jack so you don't have to disconnect the\nspeakers to listen privately. These speakers don't give you any way to adjust\nthe bass or treble, but with the well-balanced sound, you likely won't miss\nthat feature.\n\n![Credit:\nAudioEngine](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\n(Image credit: AudioEngine)\n\n### AudioEngine A2+\n\nRich sound in a bold design\n\n **Type of system:** 2.0 | **Inputs:** 3.5mm, RCA stereo, micro USB;RCA output\n| **Size:** 6 x 5.3 x 4 inches | **Watts:** 15 (per speaker)\n\nPrime\n\n[$269](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07MYV2527%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-\nus-3021866269443855000-20)\n\n[View at\nAmazon](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07MYV2527%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-\nus-3021866269443855000-20)\n\n[$398](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=487978656&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F487978656&subId1=tomsguide-\nus-3923426624179280400)\n\n[View at\nWalmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=487978656&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F487978656&subId1=tomsguide-\nus-1155226166071697000)\n\n[$2,000](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=760814316&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F760814316&subId1=tomsguide-\nus-2884069898487354400)\n\n[View at\nWalmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=760814316&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F760814316&subId1=tomsguide-\nus-8062228953294888000)\n\n[See all prices (5\nfound)](https://www.tomsguide.com/deals/compare?model_name=Audioengine%20A2%2B&filter_product_types=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback)\n\n[619 Amazon customer\nreviews](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Freviews%2FB00DQMJE7E%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-us-3652470397135745500-20)\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nDetailed sound\n\nBalanced bass, treble and mid\n\nExpensive\n\nIf you've got an affinity for detailed audio, pick the A2+ for your desk.\nThese compact 6 x 5.3 x 4 speakers deliver crisp treble, a wide sound field,\nand balanced bass and midrange without a subwoofer. Plus they crank, thanks to\n15 watts of power per speaker (and they sound best when you turn them up). The\nsimple and elegant design looks good on your desk too. You'll pay for the\nquality, but the reward is excellent overall sound.\n\nThis speaker system features a 3.5 mm audio hookup, making it compatible with\njust about every computer on the market. (You won't be able to hook it up to\nmost modern smartphones, although you might have better luck with tablets,\ndepending on the manufacturer.) The lack of a subwoofer is also helpful for\ndesks with limited floor space, or those with bass-sensitive downstairs\nneighbors.\n\n![Credit: Logitech](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Logitech)\n\n### Logitech Z625\n\nBig on bass\n\n **Type of system:** 2.1 | **Inputs:** Optical digital audio, two 3.5mm, RCA |\n**Size:** Satellites | **Watts:** 35 (per satellite)\n\n[$149.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/221109/633495/10014?prodsku=6244602&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6244602%2Fpdp&intsrc=CATF_4831&subId1=tomsguide-\nus-4788264799579693000)\n\n[View at Best\nBuy](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/221109/633495/10014?prodsku=6244602&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6244602%2Fpdp&intsrc=CATF_4831&subId1=tomsguide-\nus-1359236376831940900)\n\n[$169.99](https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/221109/509103/8585?prodsku=980-001258&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fproduct%2Fpowerful-thx-\nsound-z625%3Futm_campaign%3Ddr%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dpla%26cvosrc%3Dcse.google.%7Bkeyword%7D%26cvo_campaign%3Dbrand%26cvo_crid%3D%7Bcreative%7D%26cvokid%3D%7Bprofile_id%7D%7C%7Baff_code%7D%26gclid%3D%7Bgclid_value%7D%26prodsku%3D%7Bproduct_id%7D%23buy&intsrc=CATF_4007&subId1=tomsguide-\nus-5419707594883834000)\n\n[View at\nLogitech](https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/221109/509103/8585?prodsku=980-001258&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fproduct%2Fpowerful-thx-\nsound-z625%3Futm_campaign%3Ddr%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dpla%26cvosrc%3Dcse.google.%7Bkeyword%7D%26cvo_campaign%3Dbrand%26cvo_crid%3D%7Bcreative%7D%26cvokid%3D%7Bprofile_id%7D%7C%7Baff_code%7D%26gclid%3D%7Bgclid_value%7D%26prodsku%3D%7Bproduct_id%7D%23buy&intsrc=CATF_4007&subId1=tomsguide-\nus-7725882300360350000)\n\n[$637](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB01L9NL7GW%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-\nus-4681582118814970000-20)\n\n[View at\nAmazon](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45724&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB01L9NL7GW%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtomsguide-\nus-4681582118814970000-20)\n\n[See all prices (7\nfound)](https://www.tomsguide.com/deals/compare?model_name=Logitech%20Z625&filter_product_types=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback)\n\n[47 Walmart customer\nreviews](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?subId1=tomsguide-\nus-1285471878463526100&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Freviews%2Fproduct%2F55395388)\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nBig, big bass\n\nOptical input\n\nLarge subwoofer\n\nBass lovers, this system is for you.

You can adjust the\nvolume via touch-sensitive buttons on the right speaker and the bass level\nthrough a knob on the back of the sub. You pay a premium for style, but you\nalso get excellent overall sound.

These 6.2 x 2.7 x 2.5-inch speakers\ndon't cost much, but they don't do much either. Simple to set up \u2014 just plug\ninto the wall and then into your computer's headphone output \u2014 they produce a\nbigger sound than most internal speakers on a laptop or desktop, but that's\nabout the only advantage. The S120s lack bass and resonance overall.\n\nStill, it's worth rmeembering that the S120 comes from Logitech, and Logitech\ngear is built to last. While there's nothing special about the S120's feature\nset or sound quality, you can at least be sure that it'll serve your computer\nfor a long time to come. In fact, it may outlive whichever computer you hook\nit up to.\n\n## How to choose the best computer speakers for you\n\nThere are three things to consider when choosing the best computer speaker for\nyour setup: sound quality, extra features and price.\n\nSound quality is a moving target, but generally speaking: Cheaper, less\nelaborate systems offer decent sound quality, but the soundscape is not that\nnuanced, and the volume is sometimes not that loud. More expensive, more\nelaborate systems tend to offer richer treble, deeper bass and more\nsubstantial vocals. A great pair of speakers shouldn't make you choose among\nthe three facets of sound; everything should be balanced.\n\nExtra features tend to come standard in more expensive speakers, but even\ncheaper models can have them. The most common extra feature is discrete\nbass/treble controls, but you can also have remote controls, wireless\nfunctionality and RGB lighting. None of these things is strictly necessary,\nbut they can make your life a lot easier, especially if you're looking to make\nyour computer into an audio powerhouse.\n\nFinally, price is pretty self-explanatory. Like most gadgets, more expensive\nspeakers tend to use better components, and thus offer better quality. On the\nother hand, sometimes you're just paying for style over substance, to be sure\nto check reviews whenever possible before you commit to a purchase.\n\n  * The [best gaming
