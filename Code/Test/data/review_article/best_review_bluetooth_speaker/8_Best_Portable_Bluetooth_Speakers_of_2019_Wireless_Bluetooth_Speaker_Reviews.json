We\nweighed all this criteria when testing speakers, along with how easy the\nspeaker was to pair, additional features the speakers offered, and even a\nuser's ability to customize the sound experience.  \n\nAdditional features, such as a waterproof body and wireless connectivity\noptions that go beyond Bluetooth, are becoming increasingly popular, too. The\nlatest offerings on the market will even let you access your favorite virtual\nassistants by Google and Amazon.\n\nOur Testing Process\n\n[ ![](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/how-we-\ntested-1586186764.gif?crop=1xw:0.8887876025524157xh;center,top&resize=300:*)\nThe In-Depth Method We Use to Review Products ](/lifestyle/a29196296/how-we-\ntest-products/)\n\nNow that you're armed with all the information you need to pick out a\nbluetooth speaker, take a look at our favorites to find the best wireless\nspeaker for you.\n\n## Best Overall\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q12WDP2?linkCode=ogi)\n\nMarshall Stockwell II Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\namazon.com\n\n$169.00\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q12WDP2?linkCode=ogi)\n\n**Product Highlights**\n\n  * Three audio drivers in Blumlein stereo setup\n  * Up to 20 hours of battery life, fast-charging capable via USB-C port\n  * IPX4 water-resistant\n  * Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity\n  * Weight: 3 pounds\n\nWith its timelessly cool design, impressive sound, portability and top-notch\nbattery life, the Marshall Stockwell II is our top Bluetooth speaker today. It\nhas a neat carrying strap, as well as a durable build with IPX4 rating for\nwater resistance.\n\nThe design of the Stockwell II has been inspired by the brand\u2019s iconic guitar\namps. In addition to the legendary Marshall logo on the front speaker grille,\nthe device\u2019s dedicated knobs for controlling the volume, bass, and treble\noutput make it look more like an amp than a speaker.\n\nMarshall also partnered with Blumlein Stereo to give the speaker the ability\nto deliver an immersive, multi-directional sound that's well-balanced and\nincredibly easy to customize via the rotating knobs I mentioned above.\nAccording to Tim Gideon from\n_[PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/review/368077/marshall-stockwell-ii)_ , the\nspeaker \u201csounds fantastic.\u201d He also noted that, thanks to the handy bass and\ntreble controls, \u201cyou can dial in pretty much any sound signature you like.\u201d\n\n#### What Our In-House Testers Thought\n\n![Scott\nSimone](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nMANAGING EDITOR\n\nScott Simone\n\n\u201cBig sound comes from this small speaker. The crisp, clear audio can envelope\na room of any size. What\u2019s more, I listen to a pretty eclectic range of music\n\u2014 think jazzy tunes from Ella Fitzgerald to throaty rifts from the likes of\nQueens of the Stone Age \u2014 and they all sound impeccable on this speaker.\u201d\n\n![Stefan Vazharov: Tech\nEditor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nSenior Tech Editor\n\nStefan Vazharov\n\n\"I like the device\u2019s built-in battery indicator, as well as the USB-C\nconnector it uses for charging. The quick-charging capabilities are also handy\n\u2014 you can get up to 6 hours\u2019 worth of audio playback after only 20 minutes.\"\n\n![Zarah\nKavarana](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nASSOCIATE EDITOR\n\nZarah Kavarana\n\n\"I particularly like that it provides omnidirectional sound, so no matter\nwhere you place it, music doesn\u2019t sound muffled. I also really enjoy the ease\nof turning the rotating knobs up top to control sound, bass, and treble. It\nallows for a more customizable sound experience because you can adjust the\nlevels to your liking.\u201d\n\nIf you like the Stockwell II speaker as much as we do but need even more\ndecibels, consider the larger and pricier [Marshall\nTufton](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QJD5MT4?linkCode=ogi) instead. It has\nsimilar design and even more impressive sound quality.\n\n## Runner-Up\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P39MLKH?linkCode=ogi)\n\nSoundcore Motion+ Bluetooth Speaker\n\namazon.com\n\n$99.99\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P39MLKH?linkCode=ogi)\n\n### Product Highlights\n\n  * Dual tweeters, woofers, and passive radiators, Qualcomm aptX and Hi-Res Audio compatible\n  * Up to 12 hours of battery life, USB-C connector for charging\n  * IPX7 waterproof\n  * Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity\n  * Weight: 2.3 pounds\n\nThe Soundcore Motion+ by Anker is a solid runner-up, as well as the best\nBluetooth speaker $100 can buy. It has an understated design, intuitive\ncontrols, audio performance that\u2019s worthy of a much higher price tag, and\nsolid battery life. The gadget is also fully waterproof, meaning that you can\ntake it anywhere with you. A\n[TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/anker-soundcore-motion-portable-\nbluetooth-speaker) editor noted that the product \u201chas almost everything you\ncould want at an appealing price point.\u201d\n\nI was blown away by the sound quality of the Soundcore Motion+. Equipped with\na multitude of audio drivers, it delivered a consistently great sound across\nthe entire frequency range during my testing. Unlike its similarly priced\ncompetitors, the speaker remained distortion-free, even at high volume levels.\nRather impressively, the speaker is even capable of streaming Hi-Res Audio\ncontent!\n\nYou can tweak the equalizer settings of the speaker to your exact liking via a\nmobile app. The Motion+ has a dedicated button for instantly enhancing the\nbass. In case _that\u2019s_ not enough, you can pair two Motion+ speakers in a true\nstereo setup.\n\nI like that Anker has equipped the speaker with a USB-C port for charging.\nAnker backs the product by a robust 18-month warranty.\n\n## A Compact and Interactive Speaker\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BHP4W36?linkCode=ogi)\n\nSoundcore Flare Bluetooth Speaker\n\namazon.com\n\n$64.00\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BHP4W36?linkCode=ogi)\n\n### **Product Highlights**  \n\n  * Dual audio drivers with passive bass radiators\n  * Up to 12 hours of battery life, microUSB port for charging\n  * IPX7 waterproof rating\n  * Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity\n  * Weight: 1.1 pounds\n\nThe fabric-covered, waterproof Soundcore Flare by Anker successfully combines\nan attractive design, intuitive controls, excellent audio quality, and great\nbattery life. With customizable LED lights, the Soundcore Flare is also\nincredibly interactive for its price point. A\n[TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/anker-soundcore-flare) editor\nhas also noted that the product is \"an amazing value in the sub-$100 wireless\nspeaker segment.\"\n\nWith a pair of high-quality audio drivers and a duo of passive bass radiators\non board, the Soundcore Flare speaker sounds a lot better than its price tag\nsuggests. Users can tweak the device\u2019s audio settings via a mobile app.\nThere\u2019s also the option to pair two speakers for a full stereo experience.\n\nThe speaker has an IPX7 waterproof rating, which means that it can survive\nfull submersion under water. The device can deliver up to 12 hours of audio\nplayback between charges. You can order the gadget with a gray or blue fabric\nfinish.  \n\nOur team member [Kayla\nRamsey](https://www.bestproducts.com/author/17359/kayla-ramsey/) loved the\ncharcoal fabric finish, and told me it makes the Soundcore Flare speaker look\n\u201cmore expensive than it is.\u201d She found the lighting ring at the bottom of the\ndevice to be a really cool feature, and she said it set it apart from other\nspeakers.\n\nKayla praised the audio quality of the Soundcore Flare, referring to it as\n\u201cgreat for such a small speaker.\u201d She found the speaker\u2019s battery sufficient\nfor two evenings of wireless tunes \u2014 in line with Anker\u2019s claims.\n\nShe also found that the option to pair it with another Soundcore Flare was\ncool, but not exactly necessary \u2014 given that the speaker fully filled the\napartment with sound without needing an additional unit.\n\n##  **The Best Waterproof Speaker**\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DD7ZJ6X?linkCode=ogi)\n\nUltimate Ears BOOM 3 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker\n\namazon.com\n\n$139.00\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DD7ZJ6X?linkCode=ogi)\n\n### Product Highlights\n\n  * Dual audio drivers and passive radiators\n  * Up to 15 hours of battery life, microUSB port for charging\n  * IP67 waterproof\n  * 2-year warranty\n  * Weight: 1.3 pounds\n\nThe all-new BOOM 3 by Ultimate Ears is the best waterproof speaker available\ntoday. It has a beautiful design and finish, amazing 360-degree sound, top-\nnotch battery life (up to 15 hours), and a host of neat features you can\naccess via a smartphone app.\n\nThe device's app-enabled features include the ability to access your favorite\nApple Music playlists with a single touch, as well as the option to connect\nover 150 BOOM speakers for a bigger sound experience. Surprisingly, Ultimate\nEars has decided to skip support for one-touch access to Spotify playlists.\n\nThe speaker is fully waterproof with an IP67 rating. This means that you can\nfully submerge it underwater. We also like that Ultimate Ears designed the\nBOOM 3 to float in water, making it perfect for pool parties.\n\nThere are three colors to pick from \u2014 black, blue, and red. In case you find\nthe BOOM 3 too small, consider the larger [MEGABOOM 3\nspeaker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DD3W154?linkCode=ogi) instead. It has a\nsimilar design, but a more compact body.  \n\nOur team member Bridget Clegg thoroughly tested the UE Boom 3 wireless\nspeaker. She was pleasantly surprised by the gadget\u2019s design and\ncraftsmanship, especially the Ultraviolet Purple color finish of its fabric.\nUnsurprisingly, Clegg liked the \u201csatisfyingly large\u201d buttons of the speaker,\nas well as its fully waterproof body.\n\nClegg noted that the sound signature of the UE Boom 3 is \u201cwell-balanced and\ncrisp\u201d for \u201cboth music and podcasts.\u201d She was also happy to discover that the\nspeaker\u2019s battery life during her testing matched the manufacturer\u2019s claim of\n15 hours between charges. Overall, she found the speaker to be a good buy,\nthanks to its waterproof design, easy setup, and a great selection of\navailable features.\n\nMy colleague [Brandon\nCarte](https://www.bestproducts.com/author/17442/brandon-carte/) liked the\nBoom 3 speaker a lot as well. He praised its \"extremely loud, crystal clear\naudio\" in a compact, travel-friendly, and waterproof form factor. He purchased\nfive additional ones - one for himself to enjoy bigger sound, and four to give\nfamily and friends.\n\n## The Ultra-Compact Pick\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q8SZLMB?linkCode=ogi)\n\nJBL Clip 3 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker\n\namazon.com\n\n$69.95\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q8SZLMB?linkCode=ogi)\n\n### Product Highlights\n\n  * 40-millimeter audio transducer\n  * Up to 10 hours of battery life, microUSB port for charging\n  * IPX7 waterproof\n  * Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity\n  * Weight: 0.49 pounds\n\nThe JBL Clip 3 is our favorite micro Bluetooth speaker. It offers a great\nblend of an elegant and colorful design, a surprisingly powerful audio\nexperience, a fully waterproof body, and up to a really impressive 10 hours of\nbattery life at an affordable price.\n\nWe really like that, for the first time, the signature metal carabiner of the\nJBL Clip series of compact speakers is available in colors that match their\nfabric finish. The latter is available in 11 color options, which is a\nremarkable feat for a product in this price point.\n\nPowered by a single 40-millimeter audio driver, the JBL Clip 3 sounds a lot\nbigger than its palm-sized form factor suggests. The gadget is also an\nimpressive performer when used as a speakerphone.\n\nAccording to [_CNET_](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/jbl-clip-3-review/), \"the\nJBL Clip 3 offers improved sound and battery life in a more durable design\nthan its predecessor.\" CNET's executive editor David Carnoy also gave the\ndevice high marks for its design and quality sound for its small size.\n\nMy colleague [Melanie Yates](https://www.bestproducts.com/author/5243/melanie-\nyates/) spent time using the JBL Clip 3 wireless speaker. She liked the\nlightweight, colorful design of the micro speaker and its built-in carabiner \u2014\nshe hung it on a towel hook in her kitchen and seamlessly enjoyed its wireless\ntunes.\n\nThe sound quality of the JBL Clip 3 impressed Melanie. She found the tiny\ngadget to deliver a better audio experience and \u201cbroader sound\u201d than a pricier\nsmart home speaker with a virtual assistant on board. Yates observed the\nbattery life of the JBL Clip 3 to be in line with the manufacturer\u2019s claims.\n\nOur contributing editor Sanah Faroke praised the JBL Clip 3 for being \"louder\nthan it looks.\" She also liked the portable size of the speaker, as well as\nits built-in clip for attaching it to a bag or a backpack.\n\n##  The Smart Pick\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VFKBQ3G?linkCode=ogi)\n\nBose Portable Home Speaker\n\namazon.com\n\n$349.00\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VFKBQ3G?linkCode=ogi)\n\n### Product Highlights\n\n  * High-excursion transducer with three passive radiators\n  * Up to 12 hours of battery life, USB-C connector for charging\n  * IPX4 rating for water resistance\n  * Bluetooth, Wi-Fi connectivity, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple AirPlay 2 compatible\n  * Weight: 2.3 pounds\n\nThe all-new Bose Portable Home Speaker is smarter and more feature-packed than\nany other entry on this list. When not in use on the go, the gadget doubles as\nan excellent smart home speaker, courtesy of built-in Wi-Fi connectivity. It\nis compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and Apple AirPlay 2\nwireless playback.\n\nThe Portable Home Speaker has the same cool design and water-resistant build\nas the [Bose SoundLink+ Revolve Bluetooth\nspeaker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCW4VFS?linkCode=ogi). I really like\nthat the newcomer has kept the fabric handle, which made the SoundLink+\nRevolve one of my favorites. Bose offers the product in silver or black.\n\nI wasn\u2019t surprised to discover that the 360-degree sound of the Portable Home\nSpeaker is rich and entertaining, just as you would expect from a Bose\noffering. Tim Gideon from [_PCMag_](https://www.pcmag.com/review/371062/bose-\nportable-home-speaker) also observed that the device \u201cdelivers impressive\npower for its size.\u201d I really enjoyed the grin-inducing bass which,\nthankfully, didn\u2019t come at the expense of the high- and the mid-range most of\nthe time.\n\nThe built-in microphones of the device picked up my voice commands even with\nthe volume up. There is a button for disabling them in case you want to take a\nbreak from Alexa or the Google Assistant.\n\nThe speaker\u2019s battery life is good, especially considering how feature-packed\nit is. I tip my hat to Bose for equipping it with a USB-C connector for\ncharging. The industry giant also offers an [optional charging\ndock](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WWKCS7R?linkCode=ogi), which is incredibly\nconvenient for home use. I believe it\u2019s well worth its $29 price tag.\n\n## The Sustainably Crafted Pick\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C7SQ3KN?linkCode=ogi)\n\nHouse of Marley No Bounds XL Bluetooth Speaker\n\nHouse of Marley amazon.com\n\n$149.99\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C7SQ3KN?linkCode=ogi)\n\n### Product Highlights\n\n  * Up to 16 hours of battery life, microUSB port for charging\n  * IP67 waterproof\n  * 2-year warranty\n  * Weight: 3.7 pounds\n\nThe coolest thing about the House of Marley No Bounds XL wireless speaker is\nits waterproof, environmentally friendly build. The materials used in the\nmaking of the stylish speaker include sustainably harvested cork, recycled\nplastics, and reclaimed hemp. The aluminum used in the making of the device is\nnaturally easily recyclable, too. We really like that, in addition to looking\ncool, the cork used in the making of the speaker allows it to float in water.\n\nThe sound of the speaker is excellent for its price point. Like all House of\nMarley products, the No Bounds XL wireless speaker a well-balanced audio\nexperience with just the right amount of bass on a consistent basis. If you\nwant, you can wirelessly pair two No Bounds XL speakers for a bigger sonic\nexperience.\n\nYou can expect up to 16 hours of use between charges from the speaker. It\u2019s\ngreat that, if necessary, you can use the device to power up other gadgets.\nThe trick works because the No Bounds XL wireless speaker has a built-in USB\nport.\n\nTim Gideon from _[PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/review/364373/house-of-marley-\nno-bounds-xl)_ liked the waterproof design and the bass-heavy sound of the\nHouse of Marley No Bounds XL. He did however, note that its speakerphone\nfeature could be better.\n\nOur editor [Adam Mansuroglu](https://www.bestproducts.com/author/15788/adam-\nmansuroglu/) tested the House of Marley No Bounds XL wireless speaker. He\nliked the \u201cminimalist design\u201d of the speaker, though he noted that its power\nbutton is a tad challenging to locate. He described the sound quality of the\ndevice as amazing after listening to various music styles.\n\nAccording to Mansuroglu, the battery life of the House of Marley No Bounds XL\nlived up to the manufacturer\u2019s claims. He observed that setting up access to\nAmazon Alexa on the speaker is a quick process.  \n\n##  **The Party-Loving Pick**\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P63D5B8?linkCode=ogi)\n\nSony SRS-XB32 Extra Bass Bluetooth Speaker\n\namazon.com\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P63D5B8?linkCode=ogi)\n\n### Product Highlights\n\n  * Dual 48-millimeter audio drivers\n  * Up to 24 hours of battery life, microUSB port for charging\n  * IP67 waterproof, shockproof, dustproof\n  * Built-in line and strobe lights\n  * Weight: 2 p0unds\n\nSony\u2019s SRS-XB32 Bluetooth speaker packs a ton of cool features, which make it\none of the best entries in its price range. Some standouts include a fully\nwaterproof design, a rugged body, built-in line and strobe lights, and a\nrobust battery life. There are three cool colors to pick from \u2014 black, blue,\nand gray.\n\nThe speaker packs two 48-millimeter audio drivers, which combine to deliver\nexcellent audio quality. Tim Gideon from\n[_PCMag_](https://www.pcmag.com/review/368591/sony-srs-xb32) also observed\nthat the device offers \"a strong listening experience\" for its price point.\nThere\u2019s an option to choose between extra-bass or live-sound modes, as well as\nto seamlessly connect multiple SRS-XB32 speakers together.  \n\nI really like that the Sony SRS-XB32 can charge your gadgets, thanks to a\nbuilt-in USB port. The feature sets the product apart from its competitors.\n\n **Read More:**\n\n[The Absolute Best Wireless Earbuds of the\nYear](https://www.bestproducts.com/tech/gadgets/a28480389/wireless-earbud-\nearphone-reviews/)\n\n[The Best Smart Speakers for Your Connected\nHome](https://www.bestproducts.com/tech/gadgets/g1962/smart-home-automation-\nproducts/)\n\n[25 of Our Favorite Smart Home\nProducts](https://www.bestproducts.com/tech/gadgets/g1962/smart-home-\nautomation-products/)\n\n ** _Follow[BestProducts.com](https://www.bestproducts.com/) on\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bestproductsdotcom),\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bestproductsdotcom/),\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/BestProducts), and\n[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/bestproductscom/)!_**\n\n[ Stefan Vazharov ](/author/14282/stefan-vazharov/) Senior Technology Editor\nStefan is the senior technology editor for\n[BestProducts.com](https://www.bestproducts.com/), where he\u2019s been covering\nthe tech industry and testing the latest gadgets since 2015; He previously\ncovered tech products for GSMArena.com and his work can also be found on\n[Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/author/14282/stefan-\nvazharov/).\n\nThis commenting section is created and maintained by a third party, and\nimported onto this page.
