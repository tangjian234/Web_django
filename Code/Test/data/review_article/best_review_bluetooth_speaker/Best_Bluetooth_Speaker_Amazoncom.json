Today I received the newly released Anker SoundCore Bluetooth\nspeaker. I couldn't have been more pumped! I love Anker products and their\ncustomer service! Anyway, you're here to read my review and I'll try to keep\nit short and sweet.  \n  \nAnker packaged this SoundCore very well. The black cardboard box is actually\nquite attractive, if a little misleading on the actual size of the SoundCore\nas its quite a bit bigger. On the inside you'll see the speaker is tucked away\nbehind some more cardboard for protection and to the right, a small cardboard\nsleeve with your micro USB charger. Immediately I was kind of bummed this\nspeaker wasn't yet using USB-C as it will become the new standard. The speaker\nis very light, as my similar in size jam box mini seems heavier. It's nicely\nbuilt and has a good feel in your hand.  \n  \nPowering on the speaker was ...[ full review](/review/R2RLCJWYWGMO85)\n\n__[ (31,548) ](/product-reviews/B016XTADG2?ref_=fsclp_pl_nr_2)\n\n[ See All Buying Options ](/gp/offer-listing/B016XTADG2?ref_=fsclp_pl_abo_2)\n\nAdd to My List\n\n* * *\n\n[ ![JBL Flip 4 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Red](https://images-\nna.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif)![JBL Flip\n4 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Red](https://m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/61G6XGNXuFL._SR500,500_.jpg) ](/JBL-Bluetooth-Portable-\nStereo-Speaker/dp/B01NAIV5N8?ref_=fsclp_pl_dp_3)\n\n[ JBL Flip 4 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Red ](/JBL-Bluetooth-\nPortable-Stereo-Speaker/dp/B01NAIV5N8?ref_=fsclp_pl_dp_3)\n\nby [ JBL\n](/stores/JBL/page/17575AD5-FBC3-4ACB-8002-79EF7CF1DE1E?ref_=ast_bln&ref_=fsclp_pl_s_3)\n\n\"JBL does it again\"  \\- by  JCW\n\nI am so fascinated how extremely great this speaker is for only a whopping\n100$ dollars.

I\u2019m not an audiophile by any stretch of the\nimagination, but I know good sound when I hear it. As one of the other\nreviewers noted, this is not a $200 Bose Soundlink mini; this is a $30 speaker\nwell within my budget. When played at full volume it is extremely loud with no\ndistortion. I normally play it at half volume and can hear it clearly\nthroughout my little 2-bedroom home. The speaker has a pretty design and is\nsolidly built. The voice announcement was annoying; it was a very weird,\nfreaky voice. I contacted customer service and received an attachment with a\nfirmware update to remove it. Milla, the customer service representative, sent\nvery precise instructions, the update was simple to install and worked\nbeautifully. The customer service was outstanding.

When it has a nice\nsolid connection or using the aux cable it puts out great volume and depth for\nits size.  \n  \nAs noted by others, the bass sound is very good for a small speaker and the\nhighs aren't as shrill as some of the JBL ipod docks I owned previously. It\nseems like a lot of this speaker's power is from resonance with the surface it\nis sitting on, so if good bass or volume is a concern you should make sure to\nposition it on a solid wood table as opposed to plastic...the sound at the\nsame setting on a beach towel in the grass or sand is noticeably quieter, ...[\nfull review](/review/RVY7O2GUROCT1)\n\n__[ (21,642) ](/product-reviews/B01MTB55WH?ref_=fsclp_pl_nr_11)\n\n[ See All Buying Options ](/gp/offer-listing/B01MTB55WH?ref_=fsclp_pl_abo_11)\n\nAdd to My List\n\n* * *\n\n[ ![Aiwa Exos-9 Portable Bluetooth Speaker](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif)![Aiwa Exos-9 Portable\nBluetooth Speaker](https://m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/81x23AsFPSL._SR500,500_.jpg) ](/Aiwa-Exos-9-Portable-\nBluetooth-Speaker/dp/B00WF78GS4?ref_=fsclp_pl_dp_12)\n\n[ Aiwa Exos-9 Portable Bluetooth Speaker ](/Aiwa-Exos-9-Portable-Bluetooth-\nSpeaker/dp/B00WF78GS4?ref_=fsclp_pl_dp_12)\n\nby [ Aiwa\n](/stores/Aiwa/page/33CF1A8E-ED56-4C48-A8D6-B1F2ACC581DE?ref_=ast_bln&ref_=fsclp_pl_s_12)\n\n\"I bought one and five days later I bought another one!\"  \\- by  Kelly Mooney\n(USA)\n\nClich\u00e9 time.  \n  \nI've never written a review on here before but I've read and benefited from so\nmany reviews through the years that I felt I should step up. I may have a\nportable speaker fetish based on the picture I've posted but in my defense it\nspans 8 years and there are so many different portables out there all with\ndifferent strengths/weaknesses and niches from size, sound, 360 sound, battery\nlife, type of battery, waterproof, durability, etc. I use an Onntz Angle for\nthe shower that's splashproof. It's upright and fits on the ledge in the\nshower next to my ear. It's $30.00 and is perfect for that with surprisingly\ndecent sound. Update: I now have a UE Roll 2 for the shower and I love it.

Finally had\nthe means to step it up a bit. I've been seeing these for several years and\ncouldn't justify spending the money. They've gone down in price since.  \n  \nWhat first sold me was being in a Verizon store, waiting to have my new work\nphone cloned and thought the music playing through their PA system was really\ngood sounding. Thinking they must have had a BOSE sound system, then I found\nout it was one of these (just one) sitting on top of a display rack in the\nmiddle of the showroom filling the room with what I thought were high-end\nceiling speakers.  \n  \nThough that wasn't enough, I needed resilience due to my filthy work\nenvironment.
