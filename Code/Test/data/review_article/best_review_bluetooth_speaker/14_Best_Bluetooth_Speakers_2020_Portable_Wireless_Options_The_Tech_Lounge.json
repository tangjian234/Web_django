Well, never fear, for this article is here for you to be able\nto weigh up the pros and cons of your potential new buy, so you know exactly\nwhat you are getting, and whether it\u2019s right for you!\n\nOne big deciding factor in the smartphone era is connectivity, as everything\nnowadays is designed with the idea of advancing in technology, wireless\ncapabilities being one of the newest trends seen in modern devices across the\nboard. This makes the rise of wireless speakers unsurprising, yet exciting\nnonetheless and this is what this article aims to focus on, but we will be\npaying tribute to the classic wired set-up as well for all the hardcore\ntraditionalists.\n\nAs these wireless devices have evolved, they have gone from somewhat a novelty\nitem; sometimes lasting only long enough for a few songs, or perhaps having\nthat horrible \u201ctinny\u201d sound that poor speakers tend to emit; to something\nwhich could easily replace many day-to-day speakers.\n\nWith this evolution, however, comes all the mind-bending jargon and specs that\nmake the picking process more complicated than necessary for someone who\ndoesn\u2019t deal in speakers. So, this summary will be breaking down the commonly\nused jargon in this introduction, as well as giving some key features to keep\nin mind for when you start browsing, before going through some of the biggest\ncompetitors out there.\n\n### Bluetooth\n\nThis is simply one of the main connection methods for a wireless speaker. This\njust means that two devices (or sometimes more) are connected without any\nwires, allowing to transfer data from one device to another (to Bluetooth\nspeakers in our case).\n\n### NFC\n\nIf you have an NFC (Near Field Communication) enabled phone, this makes your\njob even easier, as you don\u2019t have to turn on Bluetooth, or search for any\ndevices; you simply put your phone near the speaker and it will allow to\nseamlessly start playing a song.\n\n### Wi-Fi\n\nThe downside to Bluetooth and NFC over Wi-Fi is the range of connectivity.\nWhile some companies boast large connective ranges, in truth, they often don\u2019t\nquite live up to it; add some walls in between your speakers and your device,\nand the signal is even less reliable.\n\nThis is where Wi-Fi fills the gap. By connecting your device to your home Wi-\nFi and by doing the same with your speakers, you are able to play your audio\ncrisply and clearly from anywhere you can access your Wi-Fi. Bluetooth still\nhas its advantages though and works well in apartments or away from the home,\nit\u2019s just down to what your needs are.\n\n### Airplay\n\n[Airplay](https://www.apple.com/airplay/) is an Apple products feature, which\nallows you to either share your whole screen or just the audio of your device\nwith any nearby compatible televisions and speakers. It works in a similar way\nto Bluetooth, in terms of range and the process of connection, so really it is\ndown to preference.\n\n### DLNA\n\nOr \u201c[Digital Living Network Alliance](https://www.techradar.com/news/digital-\nhome/home-networking/dlna-what-it-is-and-what-you-need-to-know-1079015)\u201d is\nthe commercial sharing platform for household devices. In effect, this is the\nsame as Apple Airplay but is compatible with Android and other types of\ndevices. One thing to note is this isn\u2019t just a piece of software to download,\nit is either built-in or it\u2019s not.\n\n### Size and weight\n\nThis is fairly self-explanatory and is really only worth considering if you\nare either looking for your speaker to fit into a certain space, if you want\nit to be as discreet as possible, or if you are looking for a portable speaker\ndevice; regardless of your reasons, it\u2019s something to keep in mind.\n\n### Durability\n\nThis is probably only more of a concern if you are looking for a portable\nspeaker; as if it is being carried around, it is more likely to be dropped.\nHowever, this could also be useful to note in general to gauge the predictable\nlifespan of your product (even with [PC speakers](/best-computer-speakers/));\nif it is well built with good materials, it may be worth the investment.\n\nThis could also be particularly appealing to those of you with young children,\nclumsy dogs or attention seeking cats; if they knock your expensive speakers\nover, are your confident they will survive the fall?\n\nThe material it is made of can also have an effect on the sounds produced and\nthe overall quality of treble and bass. Wood, for example, is strong but has\npore-like seams between the grains, allowing for more vibration, giving a more\n\u2018acoustic\u2019 feel to your music. This, however, isn\u2019t always ideal for music\nwith a lot of bass, as the extra vibrations can allow for distortion to\ncertain frequencies in lower-end, wooden speakers.\n\nA strong, sturdy metal case or even a tempered, rigid plastic, will allow for\nbass without the distortion, but it can lead to an overly clean and precise\nsound, and if you want a rustic vibe to the music you listen to, you won\u2019t get\nit.\n\n### Smart\n\nA feature which is becoming more and more prominent in technology these days\nis their smart functions. This can simply mean something which makes things\neasier to go between devices, with interesting new functions (think NFC) but\nit can also mean that it is a device which doubles as one for its standard\nuse, and two for an additional useful feature.\n\nThe best example we can give, which also fits the article, are home speakers\nwhich are also equipped with voice commands and functions, such as Amazon\nAlexa. This generally means that you don\u2019t need to press buttons to change\nsongs, or that you can take a phone call through your speakers, but in the\ncase of Alexa, Siri and Google Now ready devices, you can set reminders,\nsearch the web, send messages, etc. all by just using your voice.\n\n### Multiroom\n\nMultiroom is a fun feature which is becoming more and more popular as speakers\ncome out each year. It does what it says on the tin, if you have multiple\nspeakers of the same brand, you can play the same song simultaneously through\nmultiple speakers (potentially in multiple rooms).\n\nThis is generally done through an app which is developed by the speaker brand,\nbut occasionally this can be done, simply by having two of the same brand and\nsame model speakers.\n\n### Battery life\n\nGoes without saying, if you want something truly wireless and portable, you\nare going to want something with a decent battery life. One key thing to think\nabout with this is that when companies say that their speakers last 16 hours\non a single charge, they generally mean at low to medium volume.\n\nIf you are using your speakers at full blast, then you can expect to see some,\nsometimes vastly, shorter lifespans. In this article, we used the times that\nhave been stated by users who have tested them at full volume continuously.\n\n### Sound Quality\n\nAny well-seasoned music enthusiast will tell you that music and sound come out\nat different frequencies and can perform differently between these differing\npitches. These are generally categorized as Highs, Middles, and Lows. If you\nplay around with your equalizer on any audio equipment, you can isolate each\nof these levels and hear them individually; sound quality, however, is the\ngeneral concept of how the device sounds as a complete sound.\n\nReally this is down to personal taste and the level of precise sound quality\nyou want, if music is part of your job, for example, this may be a big factor,\nwhereas if you are just looking for some speakers to play some music while you\nread in the evening, for example, this may not matter so much.\n\n### Water Resistance\n\nThis is a feature which, again, has gained more recognition as a sought-after\ntrait in recent years. This doesn\u2019t mean physically taking it underwater and\nlistening to your favorite playlist whilst swimming under the surface, but\ninstead, that general splashing and poor weather, won\u2019t affect your device.\n\nThis is particularly good for pool parties, outdoor events or even if it is\njust installed in a building with sprinklers fitted; if they go off, at least\nyou won\u2019t have to fork out cash to replace everything.\n\n## 14 Best Bluetooth Speakers You Can Buy in 2020\n\n### JBL Charge 4\n\n#### The Best Waterproof Bluetooth speaker\n\n![jbl charge 4](/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/jbl-charge-4.png)  \nSimple in use and at the same time multifunctional \u2013 these are probably the\nfirst words which come to mind when you see JBL Charge 4. This Bluetooth\nspeaker would be a nice choice for those who love listening to music outdoors\nas it\u2019s not afraid of rain or any other sources of water like pools or lakes.\nJBL Charge 4 is waterproof, so you can be sure that music won\u2019t leave you\nafter the first raindrops on the speaker.\n\nThis portable speaker isn\u2019t the most compact one you can find nowadays, but it\nhas a range of features which compensate this little drawback. And the first\none is its battery life. Thanks to its rechargeable Li-ion battery JBL Charge\n4 is able to provide you with 20-hour music marathon. Besides, this wireless\nspeaker can share its battery life via USB with your cell phone, charging it\nwhen necessary.\n\nJBL Charge 4 delivers not only music but also phone calls from smartphones,\ntablets or laptops. It can be connected wirelessly from a distance. The only\ncondition is to have a Bluetooth-enabled device.\n\nThere is also a built-in microphone which enables hands-free calls which have\nclear sound due to the noise and echo-cancelling speakerphone. Consequently,\nmusic delivered by JBL Charge 4 is also crisp and really loud.\n\nPros:\n\n  * waterproof\n  * 20-hour battery life\n  * charges other devices\n  * links up with other JBL Bluetooth speakers\n\nCons:\n\n  * some distorts at high volumes\n\n[__Check\nPrices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKQ6YGX/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=techlounge0f-20&linkId=3a1e065d8b7c1cae2825a6dc113d76f3)  \n\n### Bose SoundLink Revolve+\n\n#### Impressive Sound and Portability\n\n![bose soundlink revolve+](/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bose-soundlink-\nrevolve.png)  \nBose doesn\u2019t fool around when it comes to sound quality! But they also know\nhow to create a portable speaker that is both durable and good-looking.

Furthermore,\nCreative Sound Blaster Roar 2 can work as an external sound card for your PC.\nThere is a micro SD slot to play audio files as well. Besides, this speaker\nhas a built-in microphone for speakerphone calls.\n\nStill, Creative Sound Blaster Roar 2 is not perfect. Its main drawback is\nbattery life. This portable speaker can offer only 8 hours and if to compare\nit with the previous models with 15 or even 20-hour battery life, this one\nisn\u2019t impressive at all.\n\nHowever, this wireless speaker has an option of quick charging as it has an AC\nadapter. The point is that it is able to charge the speaker only in 2.5 hours.\nThere is also the other option, namely charging via micro USB. By the way,\nCreative Sound Blaster Roar 2 has one more built-in full-sized USB Type-A port\nwhich enables keeping mobile devices charged by means of the Roar 2\u2019s 6000 mAh\nbattery.\n\nPros:\n\n  * micro SD slot\n  * NFC\n  * AC adapter\n  * charges with micro USB\n  * great sound\n\nCons:\n\n  * 8-hour battery life\n  * no water or drop resistance\n\n[__Check\nPrices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00W8O6H3K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=techlounge0f-20&linkId=65ef238c365b9b08e1efb0dc9f082921)  \n\n### JBL Flip 5\n\n#### The Best Bluetooth speaker under $100\n\n![jbl flip 5](/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/jbl-flip-5-1.png)  \nIt\u2019s one of the best cheap portable speakers which will cost you around $100.\nIts Bluetooth 4.2 interface enables pairing with any devices (laptops, phones\nor tablets), which supports this function. It can be also linked wirelessly to\nmultiple JBL Connect-enabled speakers together to amplify the sound. Note that\nthere is a JBL Connect \u2013 a free app for iOS and Android devices.\n\nWhat is more, it also belongs to the category of splash-proof wireless\nspeakers. JBL Flip 5 has a fabric as well as rubber housing which allows\nplaying music at the pool or beach parties. Its Bluetooth technology provides\na typical streaming range of 33ft (10m).\n\nJBL Flip 5 has a built-in noise and echo canceling speakerphone. The sound of\nthis speaker is clear and rather loud if to take into account its compact\nsize. There are also dual external bass radiators for low-frequency bass\ntones.\n\nThis Bluetooth speaker has an average battery life which reaches up to 12\nhours. Note that with a maximum sound you can pump only about 8 hours. But if\nyou change the settings then you get 2 extra hours. Of course, it\u2019s not\nsomething to be proud of but for such price it\u2019s even more than enough.\n\nJBL Flip 5 has a rechargeable 4,800 mAh battery and it takes about two and a\nhalf hours to fully recharge. By the by, this speaker has light indicators\nwhich help to show the battery level. In a nutshell, JBL Flip 5 is cheap,\ncompact and at the same time loud.\n\nPros:\n\n  * splash-proof \n  * low price\n  * sound quality\n  * charges with micro USB\n\nCons:\n\n  * no playback controls\n\n[__Check\nPrices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QK2SPP7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=techlounge0f-20&linkId=82eb2596806ba4e03f5e16a37f6762b5)  \n\n### Anker Soundcore Motion B\n\n#### The Best Budget Bluetooth Speaker\n\n![anker soundcore motion b](/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/anker-soundcore-\nmotion-b.png)  \nIt\u2019s probably the cheapest wireless speaker on our list with a price of less\nthan $50. But if you have certain doubts concerning the quality of this\nspeaker for such price, leave them. Anker Soundcore Motion B is really good\nand its price isn\u2019t the only advantage for sure.\n\nThis Bluetooth speaker is made of soft plastic and a grille. Its design is\nquite simple and there is nothing special about it at all. Besides, plastic\ntends to attract fingerprints what in the course of time makes a speaker look\nnot very attractive. Thus, keep in mind that you will need to do regular\nwiping. We can also say that such corpus isn\u2019t likely to survive hard drops\n(though it\u2019s durability is improved compared to previous versions). Motion B\nis also IPX7 waterproof.\n\nIts buttons are blended into the plastic corpus what sometimes requires extra\nclicks. There is also the small LED light on the front of the speaker. Its\nflash is blue during pairing and connecting process. If its color changes to\nred, it\u2019s a signal of the low battery.\n\nAnker Soundcore Motion B has Bluetooth 4.2 which provides the streaming range\nof about 66ft (18.2m). Still, bear in mind that if you reach 40ft there is a\nchance of stuttering and skipping. But this happens only if there are walls.\nOn the whole, its sound quality is fine. You will get good lows as well as\nmids, but when it comes to the high end you can hear slight harshness at max\nvolume, though it isn\u2019t so bad indeed.\n\nSoundcore Motion B doesn\u2019t provide 24 hours of playtime as it\u2019s predecessor\n(only 12) but it\u2019s twice louder so that\u2019s probably where the power went.\n\nPros:\n\n  * waterproof\n  * low price\n\nCons:\n\n  * highs are somewhat harsh\n\n[__Check\nPrices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CSPLGV9/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=techlounge0f-20&linkId=23f70e0eede2d2ee11cb82a23076f5f9)  \n\n### Bose SoundLink Color 2\n\n#### Best compact Bluetooth speaker\n\n![bose soundlink color 2](/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bose-soundlink-\ncolor-2.png)  \nBose SoundLink Color has an average set of options for quite a reasonable\nprice and this make it one of the most universal speakers for users with\ndifferent demands and budgets.\n\nBose SoundLink Color can be paired virtually with any Bluetooth-enabled\ndevice, including phones, tablets and laptops.

However, audiophiles may\nfind it a bit lacking in terms of clarity and warmth. This is because there\nare only one woofer and one tweeter to deal with the entire musical specter.\nAs a result, some notes are lost in translation (so to speak), but this\ndoesn\u2019t take away from the overall level of quality.\n\nPros:\n\n  * Modern & slick design\n  * Highly portable\n  * Long battery life\n  * Good bass and volume\n  * Ideal for regular music listeners\n  * Good value for the money\n\nCons:\n\n  * Only one woofer and one tweeter\n  * Not for audiophiles\n\n[__Check\nPrices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HJCLJJ6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=techlounge0f-20&linkId=1d61c1785c7f53bbaf58eba560d10886)  \n\n### Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM 2\n\n#### Surprisingly Funny & Loud\n\n![ultimate ears wonderboom 2](/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ultimate-ears-\nwonderboom-2.png)  \nMarketed as the ultimate speaker for when you want to have fun, the WONDERBOOM\ncomes in a wide range of vivid colors.
