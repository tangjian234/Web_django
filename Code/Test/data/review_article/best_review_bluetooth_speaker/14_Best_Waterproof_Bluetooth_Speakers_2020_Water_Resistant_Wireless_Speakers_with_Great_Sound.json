Go white water rafting. These'll\nhold up.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nBy [Sarah Rense](/author/14093/sarah-rense/)\n\nMay 12, 2020\n\nCourtesy\n\nSpeakers take a beating. We lug them across backyards and cross country. We\nstuff them into the bottom of beach bags, where they mingle with sand,\nsunscreen, and beer can condensation. And then there's the water\u2014we clog them\nwith steam in the shower, put them too close to the lapping waves at the lake,\nset them down near kids with water guns. We use them to blast summer hits\nacross a party full of tipsy people carrying Aperol spritzes who all want a\nturn playing DJ (sadly, there might be less of that this summer). So owning a\nwaterproof\u2014or at the very least, water-resistant\u2014wireless speaker makes a\nwhole lot of sense.\n\nHold tight for some rather dry, owner's-manual speak: Bluetooth speakers come\nwith a rating system formatted like \"IPXX\" to indicate just how strong it is\nagainst the elements. It's simple enough to translate. The first X will be a\nnumber between zero and six that rates the speaker's ability to protect\nagainst solids, like dust. The closer to six, the better. The second X will be\na number between zero and eight that rates the speaker's ability to protect\nagainst liquids, like, you guessed it, water. The closer to eight, the better.  \n\nTake the rating IP67: To you, that means the speaker has the best protection\nagainst dust (six) and the near-best protection against water (seven).\nAlternatively, the rating IPX4 means the speaker has no dust protection rating\nand is only water resistant\u2014a.k.a. you can't dunk it in the pool _._ All but\nfour of the speakers on this list have a waterproof rating of seven or higher,\nwhich means you can submerge them in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes.\nAnd since a lot of waterproof speakers are built to float, it likely won't\ncome to a half-hour dunking.\n\n(If a speaker's rating has an X instead of a digit, that means there's no\nofficial rating at all; you'll have to trust what the manufacturer says.)  \n\nNow, onto the speakers themselves. These are the best waterproof (or water-\nresistant) Bluetooth speakers to get you through the summer of 2020\u2014whether\nyou're looking for pristine audio or something that's cheap and durable. Go\nforth and share the music.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nBest for the Shower\n\nGO 2\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CZ45GMT/?linkCode=ogi)\n\nJBL amazon.com\n\n$49.99\n\n[Buy](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CZ45GMT/?linkCode=ogi)\n\nYou don't need a $300 sound system with a subwoofer for your morning shower.\nOr, if you do, you're showering differently than the rest of us. But this\nlittle three-inch speaker from JBL will fill your bathroom with sound without\nhogging counter or shelf space. Its speaker-phone capability means you can\nfield calls in the shower\u2014but don't. And with an IPX7 rating, it's safe to\ncompletely submerge, should it fall into the bath.\n\n_Battery life: up to 5 hours_\n\nSoundcore 2\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTB55WH?linkCode=ogi)\n\nAnker amazon.com\n\n$39.99\n\n[Buy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTB55WH?linkCode=ogi)\n\nAnker gives you a lot for not a lot of money. The speaker itself is waterproof\nwith an IPX7 rating, so you can cart it anywhere messy. It has an outstanding\nbattery life of up to 24 hours, which makes sense, considering Anker is best\nknown for its charging devices. But what really makes it stand out is its\nBassUp technology. Unlike a lot of budget Bluetooth speakers, Anker doesn't\ncheap out on the low end, producing rich, thumping bass.\n\n_Battery life: up to 24 hours_\n\nBest Boat Speaker\n\nThe Barnacle+\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525077&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F135270&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.esquire.com%2Flifestyle%2Fg27555291%2Fbest-\nwaterproof-bluetooth-\nspeakers%2F%3Fpre%3Dlifestyle%252F%26prefix%3Dg%26id%3D27555291%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fbest-\nwaterproof-bluetooth-speakers)\n\nSpeaqua rei.com\n\n$49.93\n\n[Buy](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525077&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F135270&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.esquire.com%2Flifestyle%2Fg27555291%2Fbest-\nwaterproof-bluetooth-\nspeakers%2F%3Fpre%3Dlifestyle%252F%26prefix%3Dg%26id%3D27555291%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fbest-\nwaterproof-bluetooth-speakers)\n\nThis tiny speaker was built to be waterborne, whether via yacht or dinky\nrowboat. It's able to float on the surface, but should it go overboard, an\nIP68 rating means it can stay submerged for a good length of time. On board, a\nsuction cup grip will anchor it, and if Bluetooth is acting funky or you don't\nwant to risk bringing your phone out into the waves, it stores a thousand\nsongs internally that it'll shuffle through, no wireless connection required.\n_  \n_\n\n_Battery life: up to 5 hours_\n\nBest Sound Quality Under $75\n\nSRS-XB12 Extra Bass\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P85CDHG?linkCode=ogi)\n\nSony amazon.com\n\n$58.00\n\n[Buy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P85CDHG?linkCode=ogi)\n\nSony's SRS-XB12 is small but mighty. Fully waterproof and dust-tight at a IP67\nrating, it fits into the palm of your hand or into a car's cupholder. Throw\nits detachable strap on, and it becomes a convenient wristlet or keychain. And\nwith punched-up bass, you'll hardly believe a thing so tiny could be producing\nsuch rich, deep audio.\n\n_Battery life: up to 16 hours_\n\nMost Portable Speaker\n\nCLIP 3\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q6ZWMLR?linkCode=ogi)\n\nJBL amazon.com\n\n$69.95\n\n[Buy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q6ZWMLR?linkCode=ogi)\n\nThe CLIP 3 (rated IPX7) is like JBL's GO 2, only with better, louder playback.\nAnd, as you can see, a carabiner, which makes a world of difference. You'll be\ntempted to hook it onto anything you can\u2014a shower rod, a golf cart, a\nbackpack, a tent strap, your dog's collar\u2014and you absolutely should. It's a\nworkhorse of a waterproof Bluetooth speaker.\n\n_Battery life: up to 10 hours_\n\nStormBox\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0784ZQFHZ/?linkCode=ogi)\n\nTribit amazon.com\n\n$57.99\n\n[Buy](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0784ZQFHZ/?linkCode=ogi)\n\nTribit's StormBox covers all the bases for this level of speaker. Its design\nmimics that of the exceptional UE speakers (more on them in a moment) but at\nhalf the price. Its IPX7 rating means it's fully waterproof. It produces nice\n(but not amazing) sound. And its battery life isn't lousy. All around, it's a\nsolid option for affordability.\n\n_Battery life: up to 20 hours_\n\nBest Party Speaker Under $75\n\nGO\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071H8MJ99?linkCode=ogi)\n\nAomais amazon.com\n\n$69.99\n\n[Buy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071H8MJ99?linkCode=ogi)\n\nThe Aomais GO speaker is loud. Like, really loud. It can easily fill a riotous\nparty with decent quality sound, whether you're inside or out. And while it's\nperhaps not the most stylish option on this list, that protective rubber and\ntough-looking design make it virtually indestructible\u2014an important quality\nwhen drunk people are congregating. With an IPX7 rating, it allows for full\nwater submersion, too. You won't go broke buying it, and you'll have it for a\nlong, long time.\n\n_Battery life: up to 30 hours_\n\nBest Sound Quality Under $100\n\nSoundLink Micro\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748N1BZD?linkCode=ogi)\n\nBose amazon.com\n\n$99.00\n\n$79.00 (20% off)\n\n[Buy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748N1BZD?linkCode=ogi)\n\nBose is one of the best consumer-level speaker brands in terms of sound\nquality. Unfortunately, you have to pay for that audio expertise. Case in\npoint: the SoundLike Micro (with an IPX7 rating), which is built to be carted\naround but at a price point that'll make you consider taking out insurance on\nit. The audio it produces is phenomenal, considering the diminutive size of\nthe thing. The trade-off is its pitiful battery life and, we'll say it again,\nthe cost.\n\n_Battery life: up to 6 hours_\n\nAll-Around Best Speaker\n\nBoom 3\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DD3VXRZ?linkCode=ogi)\n\nUltimate Ears amazon.com\n\n$149.99\n\n[Buy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DD3VXRZ?linkCode=ogi)\n\nWhen in doubt, go with Ultimate Ears. UE makes an excellent waterproof\nBluetooth speaker, the Boom 3. With 360-degree sound built on a deep bass\nfoundation, it will impress anyone with a keen ear for audio. It is rated IP67\nfor dust and water protection, but you'd hardly know it from its nice-looking\nfabric cover. Though the one-touch button makes selecting music simple, it\ncomes with an app, too. The Boom 3 is an indisputable winner, hitting the\nsweet spot of really good design and fair pricing.\n\n_Battery life: up to 15 hours_\n\nMost Stylish Speaker\n\nKilburn II\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H7CZ6BZ/?linkCode=ogi)\n\nMarshall amazon.com\n\n$299.99\n\n$199.99 (33% off)\n\n[Buy](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H7CZ6BZ/?linkCode=ogi)\n\nMarshall makes speakers that look so damn cool. The Kilburn II is one of\nthem\u2014and even though it has an IPX2 rating, meaning it is resistant to only a\nfew splashes of water, it's worth considering for the style alone. It is a\npowerful box, with nobs to control volume, bass, and treble for pristine audio\ncontrol. You won't find that on most Bluetooth speakers. It's about the size\nof a lunch box, and that strap makes for easy carrying; but go for [the\nStockwell II model](https://www.amazon.com/Marshall-Stockwell-Portable-\nBluetooth-Speaker/dp/B07Q12WDP2) for something smaller and cheaper.\n\n_Battery life: 20+ hours_\n\nSoundLink Revolve+\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCW4VFS?linkCode=ogi)\n\nBose amazon.com\n\n$299.00\n\n[Buy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCW4VFS?linkCode=ogi)\n\nAnother excellent but pricey Bose speaker. With the SoundLink Revolve+, you'll\nget all-encompassing sound, voice prompts, and the Bose Connect app. The\nspeaker can also go into Stereo or Party mode. However, with an IPX4 rating,\nit's only water resistant.\n\n_Battery life: up to 16 hours_\n\nBest Adventure Speaker\n\nDemerBox DB2\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B076FBZ53W/?linkCode=ogi)\n\nDemerBox amazon.com\n\n$332.67\n\n[Buy](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B076FBZ53W/?linkCode=ogi)\n\nThe DemerBox Speaker is rugged. Drop the thing off a cliff, and it'll probably\nstill work. The Bluetooth range is great (up to 100 feet) and the battery life\nis superb. It isn't rated, but it says it is \"100-percent waterproof,\" and it\neven opens up like a toolbox to give you internal storage that stays dry.\nThere's also an internal USB charger to keep your phone charged. This is a\nBluetooth speaker built for adventure.  \n\n_Battery life: up to 40 hours_\n\nBest Indoor/Outdoor Speaker\n\nMove\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525077&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fshop%2Fmove.html%3Fgclsrc%3Daw.ds%26%26utm_campaign%3DGGL_US_EN_SONOS_B_MOVE_EXACT_360i%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_content%3DGGL_US_EN_SONOS_B_MOVE_EXACT_360i%26utm_term%3Dsonos%2520move%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjw5cL2BRASEiwAENqAPhKBRmoy_qSWXEGDNkiJ4WxEvgWmc1Cw-\nRhhdH-\nxMnB8N8-WQbrcQRoCIDsQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.esquire.com%2Flifestyle%2Fg27555291%2Fbest-\nwaterproof-bluetooth-\nspeakers%2F%3Fpre%3Dlifestyle%252F%26prefix%3Dg%26id%3D27555291%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fbest-\nwaterproof-bluetooth-speakers)\n\nSonos sonos.com\n\n$399.00\n\n[Buy](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525077&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fshop%2Fmove.html%3Fgclsrc%3Daw.ds%26%26utm_campaign%3DGGL_US_EN_SONOS_B_MOVE_EXACT_360i%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_content%3DGGL_US_EN_SONOS_B_MOVE_EXACT_360i%26utm_term%3Dsonos%2520move%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjw5cL2BRASEiwAENqAPhKBRmoy_qSWXEGDNkiJ4WxEvgWmc1Cw-\nRhhdH-\nxMnB8N8-WQbrcQRoCIDsQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.esquire.com%2Flifestyle%2Fg27555291%2Fbest-\nwaterproof-bluetooth-\nspeakers%2F%3Fpre%3Dlifestyle%252F%26prefix%3Dg%26id%3D27555291%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fbest-\nwaterproof-bluetooth-speakers)\n\nSonos' Move speaker is big and beautifully designed. Everything about it is\ndone correctly: the smart assistant integration, the audio depth, the\ncontrols. And though you can't see it here, it has a handle carved into the\nback so you can grab and, see what they did here, _move_. Use it inside, in\nevery room. Use it outside, wherever you wander. It's sturdily built and has a\ndust-and-waterproof rating of IP56, so splashes of water and clods of dirt\nwon't do harm.  \n\n_Battery life: up to 10 hours_\n\nBoombox\n\n[\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0759GC766?linkCode=ogi)\n\nJBL amazon.com\n\n$499.95\n\n[Buy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0759GC766?linkCode=ogi)\n\nJBL made a waterproof Bluetooth speaker that is as loud and bulky as an old-\nschool boombox. Hence its name: Boombox. The sound coming out of this speaker\nis immense, with enough bass to make the pool water ripple. Its ability to\nconnect to two devices is ideal for parties, tailgates, and anywhere else\npeople are fighting over the playlist. And it has IPX7 waterproofing.
