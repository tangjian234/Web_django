Its bass is\ndistortion free, and its mid-range is nice and punchy.\n\nIt's also backed by a complete swath of connectivity options, so you'll have\nno problem getting your more obscure apps playing through the speaker.\n\nThe only problem is its price: $699 / \u00a3499 / AU$999. But while the sticker\nprice ensures that only serious audiophiles will give it some consideration,\nit's a lot less pricey than the Mu-So Qb, and you get a similar level of sound\nquality.\n\n**Read the full review:** [Bowers & Wilkins Zeppelin\nWireless](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/hi-fi-and-\naudio/bowers-and-wilkins-zeppelin-wireless-1306322/review)\n\n _[Update: We recently saw the new_[ _Bowers & Wilkins Formation\nFlex_](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/bowers-and-wilkins-formation-flex)\n_in action \u2013 and so far we're impressed.

Some of its\nexperiments with upmixing stereo sources can sound a bit confused, but it's\notherwise a very powerful, feature-rich smart speaker \u2013 especially considering\nthe price.\n\nIt's a good option for anyone who's low on space and can't stretch to an\nupfiring soundbar or multi-speaker setup, while Alexa smarts means that it can\nact as the center of your smart home, as well as your music player.\n\nIf you're upgrading from the simple speakers built into your TV, or a lowly\nstereo soundbar, it's a fantastic and simple upgrade to make to your home\ncinema system. You'll get a cracking, resonant bass response, excellent volume\nand far more depth than a comparably-priced soundbar can offer.\n\nAs ever with virtualized surround sound, it's not as impactful as having\ndiscrete physical speaker channels above and behind you, hooked up to a [home\ntheater receiver](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-av-receiver-2017-which-\nhome-cinema-av-receiver-should-you-buy). But that's a huge expense, and not\npractical for all living room arrangements, making the powerful Echo Studio an\nimpressive value option.\n\n **Read the full review:** [Amazon Echo\nStudio](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/amazon-echo-studio-review)\n\n## Best wireless speakers 2020 at a glance\n\n  1.

If you're looking for room-filling sound, check out models\nthat feature 360-degree grilles and disperse audio at all angles; the Amazon\nEcho Studio or the Sonos One are good places to start.\n\nIf it's true audio-fidelity you're after, opt for trusted brands like Sonos,\nBowers & Wilkins, and KEF \u2013 speakers from these companies are always likely to\nsound brilliant.\n\nIf smart home connectivity is your main concern, then check out Amazon Echo\nand Google Home / Nest speakers; you'll need to work out which voice\nassistant's ecosystem suits you, Alexa or [Google\nAssistant](https://www.techradar.com/how-to/google-assistant-how-to-make-your-\ngoogle-home-speaker-work-for-you).\n\n### Wireless speaker deals\n\nToday's best connected speaker deals\n\nSonos One\n\n[Sonos One](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6361382/type/dlg/sid/trd-\nus-1159340766947051800/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/one.html?sid=hawk-\ncustom-tracking)\n\nSonos\n\n[$199](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6361382/type/dlg/sid/trd-\nus-1159340766947051800/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/one.html?sid=hawk-\ncustom-tracking)\n\n[Preorder](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6361382/type/dlg/sid/trd-\nus-1159340766947051800/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/one.html?sid=hawk-\ncustom-tracking)\n\n[See all\nprices](https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?model_name=Sonos%20One)\n\nSonos - Refurbished Play:5...\n\n[Sonos\nPlay:5](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/221109/633495/10014?prodsku=6404211&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6404211%2Fpdp&intsrc=CATF_4831&subId1=trd-\nus-1346361502204094000)\n\nBest Buy\n\n[$299.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/221109/633495/10014?prodsku=6404211&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6404211%2Fpdp&intsrc=CATF_4831&subId1=trd-\nus-1346361502204094000)\n\n[View](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/221109/633495/10014?prodsku=6404211&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6404211%2Fpdp&intsrc=CATF_4831&subId1=trd-\nus-1346361502204094000)\n\n[See all\nprices](https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?model_name=Sonos%20Play%3A5)\n\nApple HomePod - Space Gray\n\n[Apple\nHomePod](https://apple.sjv.io/c/221109/795481/7613?prodsku=MQHW2LL%2FA&irck=a4lbVtuk4Buw0VzQ3c2ybBkphi3G6Ppo&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus%2Fxc%2Fproduct%2FMQHW2&intsrc=CATF_5721&subId1=trd-\nus-1286138719817191700)\n\nApple\n\n[$299](https://apple.sjv.io/c/221109/795481/7613?prodsku=MQHW2LL%2FA&irck=a4lbVtuk4Buw0VzQ3c2ybBkphi3G6Ppo&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus%2Fxc%2Fproduct%2FMQHW2&intsrc=CATF_5721&subId1=trd-\nus-1286138719817191700)\n\n[View](https://apple.sjv.io/c/221109/795481/7613?prodsku=MQHW2LL%2FA&irck=a4lbVtuk4Buw0VzQ3c2ybBkphi3G6Ppo&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus%2Fxc%2Fproduct%2FMQHW2&intsrc=CATF_5721&subId1=trd-\nus-1286138719817191700)\n\n[See all\nprices](https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?model_name=Apple%20HomePod)\n\nNaim Mu-so Qb Multi-Room...\n\n[Naim Audio Mu-So\nQb](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB01AY7EWZW%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-\nus-1045243775160857300-20)\n\nAmazon\n\n[$699](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB01AY7EWZW%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-\nus-1045243775160857300-20)\n\n[View](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB01AY7EWZW%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-\nus-1045243775160857300-20)\n\n[See all\nprices](https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?model_name=Naim%20Audio%20Mu-\nSo%20Qb)\n\nWe check over 130 million products every day for the best prices\n\n[View All\nDeals](https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?model_name=Sonos%20One%2CSonos%20Play%3A5%2CApple%20HomePod%2CNaim%20Audio%20Mu-\nSo%20Qb&filter_product_types=contracts%2Cdeals%2Csubscriptions)\n\n[See more Audio news ](https://www.techradar.com/news/audio)\n\n__Tech deals, prizes and latest news\n\nGet the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable\ntech news and more!\n\nThank you for signing up to TechRadar.
