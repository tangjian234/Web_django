standard portable wireless speaker just won\u2019t hack it if it is not\ndesigned to pump 360\u00b0 omni-directional sound. We look at 10 of the best omni-\ndirectional speakers with sound to fill any room and to take with you wherever\nyou go.\n\nWireless portable speaker makers have been innovating like mad the past few\nyears. The result, super lightweight and portable wireless speakers with ultra\nlong battery life that project sound in all directions so it does not matter\nwhere you place it. Still, the best place to put any of these speakers, given\nthat it is wireless, is in the middle of the room.\n\n![bno-beolit-15-black-\nstage](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20680'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n## What To Look For When Choosing a Wireless Portable Speaker\n\nWe love our music, so much so that we want to take it with us wherever we go\nto share it with others. And if you like sharing, these speakers do it best.\nKey features to look for are:\n\n#### Durability\n\nIf you are always out and about, get a shockproof and waterproof speaker to\nmake sure that it is ready for the outdoor and is weather resistant. If the\nintention is to have a portable speaker that you can move around indoors say\nfrom the bedroom to the home office to the kitchen then you have a wider\nchoice. To help you decide, both standard and waterproof or weather resistant\nmodels are clearly marked in our list below.\n\n#### Design and Colour\n\nWhether you are a traditionalist, a minimalist or the outgoing sort, there is\na design for you. From dark shades of black to bright white and all the\ncolours in between, there is a 360\u00b0 omni-directional speaker to suit everyone.\n\n#### Connectivity\n\nBluetooth and WiFi versatility. Most standard wireless portable speakers use\nBluetooth to connect to your mobile device. There are now portable speakers\nthat als support streaming over WiFi. These speakers can stream directly from\nthe Internet negating the need for a mobile device. Some speakers support\nmulti-host for playing songs from two to three Bluetooth devices so they can\ntake turns swapping tracks. For ease of pairing with mobile devices, some\nspeakers support NFC (Near Field Communication) letting you connect your\nspeakers to your smartphone quickly.\n\n  \n\n#### Multi-room and Multi-speakers\n\nif you have more than one speaker in the vicinity why not play your tunes on\ntwo or more speakers to push up the volume, great for real stereo, parties and\nmulti-room setup. In multi-room mode, you can have your home \u2018wired\u2019 up\nvirtually to play the same music in grouped mode.\n\n#### Battery Life\n\nYou want your speakers to last at least the day when you are out before\nneeding to find a wall socket. Speakers in our lasts from 8 hours per charge,\nplenty of time to enjoy your tunes. The best playtime we have seen lasts up to\n24 hours on a single charge. Most speakers also lets you charge your device\nsuch as smartphone or tablet, should you need to keep the groove going.\n\n#### Size\n\nIt is always a toss up when considering speakers by size. Bigger speakers\nnaturally means bigger sound and higher volume. It also offers deeper base\nwith use of bass radiators and bigger drivers. Still, the smaller speakers in\nour line-up are more than capable of producing quality sound with a small\ncompromise.\n\n#### Form Factor\n\nMost speakers are water bottle or cylindrical form factor making the 360\u00b0\nsound projection possible. Still there are other clever omni-directional\nspeakers with revolutionary tri-projection design or the more conventional ice\nbox profile. It really comes down to personal choice.\n\n## Top 10 Best Omni-directional Portable Wireless Speakers\n\nHere is a quick list of our 10 best omni-directional portable wireless\nspeakers.

On the top of the speaker are easy access interface to power on,\npair, play and skip your tracks. On the side, you get bit plus and minus\nbuttons to increase or decrease the volume respectively.\n\n#### UE BOOM 3 is Designed for Life\n\nGone is the durable rubber spine that houses the volume control buttons on the\nside but the unit is still virtually indestructible. It is purpose built to\nwithstand tumbles, drops, water and dust. For the latter, the speaker is IP67\nrated meaning it can be totally submerged in water for up to 30 minutes.\nHowever, it won\u2019t stay submerged for long as the buoyancy of the device will\nmake it pop back up to the surface.\n\nBut the most important thing that we consider here is the good quality and\nloud sound with deep, accurate and rich bass. That and the fact that the\nspeaker can pump out spatial 360 degree sound from its cylindrical design,\nradiating stereophonic audio evenly in all directions. For even bigger sound,\ncheck out MEGABOOM 3 below.\n\n#### Key Features\n\n **Bluetooth** (range 100 ft) pair up to **8 source** device | Connect up to\n**2 sources at the same time** | **Block Party** \u2013 take turns playing music\nfrom up to 3 Bluetooth Devices | Stream to 2 or more UE speakers at the same\ntime from one source for stereo effect | **PartyUP** \u2013 pair more than 2 to\nover 150 BOOM and MEGABOOM speakers via the app for ultimate surround sound |\n**4 customisable EQ** presets | Range up to **45m** (150 ft) | Dust and\nWaterproof **IP67** | stain resistant acoustic fabric | **15 hours** per\ncharge | iOS and Android App | Speaker phone | Dimensions: 184mm (H) x 73mm\n(D) | Weight: **608 grams**\n\nAudio: Maximum Sound Level: 90dBA. Frequency Range: 90Hz \u2013 20kHz. Drivers: Two\n2\u201d drivers and two 2\u201d x 4\u201d Passive Radiators.\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\.

It also weighs 317 grams more. Both speakers when put side by\nside, makes the UE BOOM 3 looks about 3 quarter the size of the full MEGABOOM.\nFor an idea of size, see image below. Being bigger means louder volume and\ndeeper bass. It also means the playtime is longer at **20 hours** per charge.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20906%20808'%3E%3C/svg%3E)UE\nBOOM 3, UE MEGABOOM3 and WONDERBOOM 2 Side By Side\n\nIt also features the same easy interface to power on, pair, play and skip on\nthe top cover as well as increase or decrease volume on the side of the\nspeaker. Again, the most important part of this review is that it is capable\nof producing loud and good quality sound with deep and rich bass. Like UE BOOM\n3, the speaker is waterproof and shock proof with IPX67 rating (waterproof up\nto 30 minutes and a depth of one meter).\n\n#### Clever Features with App\n\nIt shares all the connectivity features with its smaller sibling such as\nremote APP control, Block Party, PartyUp, Remote On/Off, Customisable EQ\npreset, Musical Alarm, Tap Controls and more.
