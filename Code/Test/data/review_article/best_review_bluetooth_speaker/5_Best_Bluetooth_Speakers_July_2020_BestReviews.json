Music from streaming services, or even your personal MP3\ncollection, will sound fantastic through a good set of headphones, but if you\nwant to play music out loud, you\u2019ll be stuck listening to your device\u2019s sub-\npar, tinny speakers.\n\nThankfully, there\u2019s hope \u2014 in the form of Bluetooth speakers. Using a\nBluetooth speaker, you can connect your smartphone or tablet and enjoy your\nmusic as it was meant to be heard: with proper bass and treble, and wire-free.\nBluetooth speakers come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from kid-oriented\nmodels that are just a few inches tall to boom-box-sized behemoths perfect for\nthe beach.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to set up wireless streaming in your home, or you just want to\nset your music free, a Bluetooth speaker is your best bet. Here\u2019s everything\nyou need to know to pick the perfect one.\n\nAbout the author\n\nKyle Schurman has been researching and writing about electronics topics for\nthe past 15-plus years. Having just the right electronics hardware to meet\nyour needs \u2013 and then knowing how to use it properly \u2013 is the key to making\nelectronics work for you (instead of the other way around).\n\n* * *\n\nKyle Schurman | Writer\n\nStay connected\n\nGet exclusive content, advice, and tips from BestReviews delivered to your\ninbox.\n\nSubscribe\n\nLike us on Facebook!\n\nStay updated\n\n[ ](https://www.facebook.com/bestreviews) [ ](https://twitter.com/bestreviews)\n[ ](https://www.instagram.com/bestreviews) [\n](https://www.linkedin.com/company/6636827) [\n](https://www.youtube.com/bestreviews) [\n](https://www.pinterest.com/BestReviews/)\n\n![](//cdn11.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/image-full-\npage-1040/20536a75137fc434cf4e137cdd7c0788.jpg)\n\nThe Bluetooth standard requires only a small amount of battery power. This is\nthe biggest advantage Bluetooth has over other wireless communication\ntechnologies.\n\n##  What is Bluetooth?\n\nBluetooth is a wireless technology that connects devices over a short\ndistance.\n\nBluetooth technology can connect [headphones ](https://bestreviews.com/best-\nheadphones)or headsets to a smartphone wire-free, for example. Wireless\nkeyboards can connect to a computer over Bluetooth, too.\n\nBluetooth is one of the easiest wireless connection technologies to use.\nSimply turn on the Bluetooth capabilities on both devices to make the\nconnection. The devices are then paired automatically.\n\n![](//cdn7.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/layout-120x120px/50798a37df8445e9083d64fa151ccf3f.jpg)\n\nEXPERT TIP\n\nDon\u2019t judge a Bluetooth speaker\u2019s quality solely on its physical size. Small\nspeakers occasionally deliver better audio quality than larger speakers.\n\n* * *\n\nStaff | BestReviews\n\n![](//cdn7.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/layout-120x120px/5a200080b0183b30f92d2631fbe6787f.jpg)\n\nTESTING BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS\n\nWe spent 8 hours researching Bluetooth speakers before picking our top 5. We\nthen purchased our favorite model and tested it in our lab.\n\n##  Types of Bluetooth speakers\n\nMost Bluetooth speakers fit into one of four design categories. Think about\nhow you\u2019ll use the speaker before picking the best design for you.\n\n###  Indoor/home Bluetooth speakers\n\nIndoor Bluetooth speakers offer better sound quality than portable speakers.\nLarge, high-quality indoor speakers can approach the audio quality of\ntraditional wired speakers. Some indoor Bluetooth speakers run from battery\npower or an AC adapter. For a Bluetooth speaker you\u2019ll use primarily at home\nand indoors, an AC adapter works great. The battery option allows you to take\nthe speaker outdoors if you want.\n\nHowever, unless the speaker specifically carries a rating for weather\nprotection, only use indoor speakers outdoors on a dry day.\n\n###  Outdoor Bluetooth speakers\n\nIf you want to take your Bluetooth speaker to a picnic or poolside, look for a\nunit rated to work outdoors. Such speakers will offer water- or weather-\nresistant capabilities to protect them from the elements.\n\nSome outdoor speakers are large enough to deliver high-volume sound while\nstill providing good battery life.\n\nOutdoor speakers sport a rugged design, too, which allows you to toss a\nspeaker into a bag and carry it anywhere.\n\n###  Portable Bluetooth speakers\n\nPortable Bluetooth speakers are extremely small. As such, they don\u2019t deliver\ntop-end audio quality. They especially tend to struggle with loud bass sounds.\nHowever, they\u2019re great for walking or biking while listening to music if you\ndon\u2019t want to use headphones.\n\nSome portable speakers are small enough to clip onto a\n[backpack](https://bestreviews.com/best-backpacks) or belt.\n\nIf you want a portable unit that also delivers good audio quality, consider an\noutdoor-rated Bluetooth speaker. It will probably be too large to clip onto a\nbackpack, but it will fit inside a backpack and stand up to rugged treatment\nduring a hike or bike ride.\n\n###  Specialty Bluetooth speakers\n\nSome Bluetooth speakers have a specific task incorporated into their design.\nFor example, some shower heads come with tiny Bluetooth speakers that fit into\nthem. If you want to connect multiple Bluetooth speakers to one source, you\u2019ll\nneed a speaker with this particular feature built into it.\n\nSome specialty Bluetooth speakers also have battery-charging capabilities.\nWith this option, you plug a USB cable into the speaker and use the extra\nbattery power stored in the speaker to charge another device, like a\nsmartphone.\n\n![](//cdn13.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/layout-\nconvert-120x120/484593ced6df840c8a6e7a19cc9f6e7e.jpg)\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nTo cover more area, you may be able to connect multiple Bluetooth speakers.\nHowever, this is not a feature on all products.\n\n![](//cdn18.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/layout-120x120px/1f99ab3edb88bffed728a02f65dfc161.jpg)\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nMost Bluetooth speakers work over line of sight. Trying to run a Bluetooth\nconnection through a wall will degrade the connection significantly.\n\n##  Why choose Bluetooth?\n\nA large wired speaker typically outperforms a small Bluetooth speaker in terms\nof overall audio quality. However, Bluetooth has quite a few advantages over\nwired speakers in other areas.\n\n###  Sound\n\nA serious audiophile won\u2019t get the type of high-end audio quality he or she\nwants with a Bluetooth speaker. But for many people, amplifiers built into\nBluetooth speakers deliver more-than-adequate sound quality.\n\n###  Ease of use\n\nBluetooth connectivity is one of the easiest ways to make a wireless\nconnection. Just place the two devices in proximity of each other, turn on\nBluetooth, and the devices pair with each other.\n\n###  Portability\n\nPerhaps the best aspect of Bluetooth speakers is their portability. You can\ntake them anywhere, indoors or outdoors, allowing you to play music wherever\nyou go with no wires needed. Bluetooth speakers run from either a battery or\nAC adapter. The battery gives them even more portability.\n\n###  Connectivity\n\nBluetooth speakers can connect with a variety of different devices. You can\nconnect a smartphone, MP3 player, laptop, or\n[tablet](https://bestreviews.com/best-tablets) to a Bluetooth speaker.\n\nAnd considering the poor-quality speakers built into these devices, connecting\na Bluetooth speaker greatly improves the audio quality of these devices.\n\n![](//cdn15.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/layout-120x120px/37e38a07a78e877cd94d1c5783d627bb.jpg)\n\nEXPERT TIP\n\nIf you plan to use your Bluetooth speaker outdoors, look for water-resistant\nand weather-resistant models.\n\n* * *\n\nStaff | BestReviews\n\n![](//cdn4.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/layout-120x120px/a24e2277425355bb6f71141156fcfa5a.jpg)\n\nEXPERT TIP\n\nSome Bluetooth speakers offer a speakerphone feature, which is ideal for\nconference calls.\n\n* * *\n\nStaff | BestReviews\n\n##  Bluetooth speaker tips\n\n  * Many Bluetooth speakers include a battery that can power other devices. This means the speaker can charge your smartphone while you\u2019re on the go.\n\n  * A Bluetooth speaker has a maximum connection range of about 33 feet. A WiFi speaker has a maximum connection range of about 125 feet.\n\n  * Some speakers can make use of both WiFi and Bluetooth wireless connectivity options.\n\n  * Bluetooth speakers designed to be used at home use an AC adapter that plugs into a wall outlet.\n\n  * Portable Bluetooth speakers run from a battery for on-the-go power. Some speakers offer both battery and plug-in options.\n\n![](//cdn10.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/image-full-\npage-680/63583586eac04ebabb291e91d9235680.jpg)\n\nFor those who struggle with making Bluetooth connections, look for a Bluetooth\napp. An app manages your Bluetooth connections from your smartphone\nautomatically.\n\n##  Bluetooth speakers FAQ\n\n**Q. Why do I get static and poor sound quality from my Bluetooth speaker?  \nA.** Bluetooth speakers offer a maximum connection range of about 33 feet from\nthe source. As you approach 33 feet, the audio quality drops. You also may see\nlower quality when the speaker\u2019s battery nears empty. Charging the battery\nwhile trying to play music may cause static as well.\n\n**Q. Why are some Bluetooth speakers called water-resistant and others called\nwaterproof?  \nA.** A water-resistant speaker will stand up to splashing or light rain. A\nwaterproof Bluetooth speaker can handle full submersion in water or extremely\nheavy rain. Look at the IP rating to figure out a speaker\u2019s resistance level.\nThe first digit in the two-digit IP number is the dust-protection number,\nwhile the second digit shows water protection. On a zero-to-nine scale, the\nhigher the number, the better the protection.\n\n**Q. Why won\u2019t my Bluetooth speaker pair with my smartphone?  \nA.** There could be a few different reasons. First, make sure to turn on\nBluetooth capabilities on the smartphone. Next, if the smartphone already has\na few active Bluetooth pairings going, disconnect a couple of them. If that\ndoesn\u2019t work, try turning off the devices and turning them back on after a few\nminutes to reset. Finally, make sure the batteries on both devices are\ncharged.\n\n**Q. Are Bluetooth speakers safe to use outdoors?  \nA.** You can use any portable Bluetooth speaker in dry outdoor conditions.\nJust keep it out of direct sunlight for extended periods of time to avoid\ndamage to the case. However, if you\u2019ll be using your Bluetooth speaker in wet\nweather or near water, you need a water- or weather-resistant model.\n\nOther Products We Considered\n\nThe BestReviews editorial team researches hundreds of products based on\nconsumer reviews, brand quality, and value.
