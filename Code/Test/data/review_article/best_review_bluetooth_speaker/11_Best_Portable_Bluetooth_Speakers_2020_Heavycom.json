I have personally sung endless\npraise for the [UE Boom 2](http://amzn.to/2BXWLED), but the Wonderboom 2\nrecently won my affection for its nearly perfect form factor.\n\nThe Wonderboom 2 is a compact take on the cylindrical Boom design, measuring\nat 3.7 x 3.7 x 4 inches. It has simple volume controls and a UE logo button\nthat works for play/pause/skip as well as forming Bluetooth connections.\n\nIt has a small hang loop to connect to a backpack, and most importantly, is\nIP67-rated for dust and water resistance. That means it can be submerged in a\nmeter of water for up to 30 minutes, and the design naturally floats. It can\nalso survive multiple drops of up to 5 feet without even a scratch to its\nsilicone casing.\n\n[Click here to watch a video review of this\nspeaker.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wviksvUgBAA)\n\nBut this speaker isn\u2019t all looks, as it also packs dual audio drivers\npositioned to deliver a clear and powerful 360\u00b0 sound with its dual 40mm\ndrivers. The speaker design incorporates two passive bass radiators to offer a\nneutral low end, with just a slight muddiness in the low-mids.\n\nThe high-mids are surprisingly present and drive songs of all genres without\nsounding awkward or imbalanced. Of course, you can always use the UE app to\nshape the EQ of the sound if you think it needs more balance. The Wonderboom 2\nhas a wide frequency range of 75Hz \u2013 20KHz, so you won\u2019t hear any\n\nMy favorite feature, which is an upgrade from the original Wonderboom speaker,\nis its Nature Mode, which modifies the sound signature to better carry audio\nthrough open outdoor spaces. I use this feature on my sample unit all the\ntime, as its smaller form factor lends itself so well to use on the go.\n\nIts battery life tops out at about 13 hours, which is pretty solid even if\nvolume starts to suffer when you are running low. A surprising change to the\nUE formula is the Wonderboom\u2019s lack of a built-in microphone.\n\nAfter sizing it up against the competition, it\u2019s safe to say the Wonderboom 2\ndoes one of the best jobs of providing convenient portable audio without\ndrastically compromising its sound.\n\n **Output Power: (Unlisted)  \nInputs: Bluetooth  \nBattery Life: Up to 13 hours  \nDimensions: 0.93 pounds  \nWeight: 3.7 x 3.7 x 4 inches  \nIP Rating: IP67**\n\n[ Find more Ultimate Ears Wonderboom information and reviews here.\n](https://amzn.to/2PkaJGP)\n\n  2. ##  2\\. Bose SoundLink Mini II \n\n[ ![bose soundlink mini\n2](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![bose\nsoundlink mini 2](https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bose-soundlink-\nmini-211.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=425) ](http://amzn.to/2EeOXQJ)\n\nPrice:  $174.88\n\n[ Amazon Customer Reviews  ](http://amzn.to/2EeOXQJ)\n\n[ Shop at Amazon ](http://amzn.to/2EeOXQJ)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n    * Clear and bass-heavy signature sound \n    * High max volume \n    * Durable aluminum casing \n\n**Cons:**\n\n    * High price tag \n    * 10 hour battery life could be better \n    * No waterproofing \n\nThough Bose hardware is usually criticized for their excessive price, the\n[SoundLink Mini II](http://amzn.to/2EeOXQJ) remains one of the top picks for\nportable audio.\n\nIt is not the most ergonomic Bluetooth speaker around, nor is it the most\nportable, but it is hands down one the best sounding. It almost sounds good\nenough that you\u2019ll forget about its near $200 price tag.\n\nIf you\u2019ve used Bose audio products before, then you know their sound signature\nis far from flat. The SoundLink Mini II is exemplary of this, with a neatly\nboosted low end that gives electronic and hip-hop tracks some added _oompf_\nwithout drowning out the mids.\n\nThe lows and mids blend together smoothly, giving the high-end sounds like\ncymbals and string instruments plenty of space in the mix.\n\nThis speaker packs plenty of volume too, without any signs of distortion even\nat 100%. Were it not for its rubber feet, this speaker could easily rattle off\nthe countertop.\n\nIt has a built-in microphone to take phone calls, plus an auxiliary port to\nconnect analog devices for playback.\n\n[Click here to watch a video review of this\nspeaker.](https://youtu.be/7HZsq_HWlfE)\n\nIn terms of build quality, the SoundLink Mini II is not without its flaws, but\nit provides the necessities for day to day use.\n\nThe speaker gets at most 10 hours of battery life, which could be better, but\nall the same is far from a deal breaker.\n\nThe speaker is rather hefty at 1.5 pounds and sports an attractive aluminum\nenclosure with a micro-perforated steel grille. Its enclosure protects the\nspeaker from serious impact, but dropping this beautiful device will leave it\nseriously scuffed up.\n\nUnlike most of my favorite speakers, this one is not rated for water or dust\nresistance.\n\nIf you like the Bose signature sound but want a more portable option, then you\ncould opt for the [SoundLink Color II](http://amzn.to/2CnMQEl). But in my\nopinion, the SoundLink Mini II\u2019s improved sound is worth the lack of\nportability.\n\nIts control scheme is very straightforward and easy to find at the top of the\nspeaker. You have the regular suite of playback, volume, Bluetooth, and power\ncontrols.\n\nAll in all, the SoundLink Mini II offers a lot of great features, but its\nprice tag remains a hurdle for casual music enthusiasts even now that this\nspeaker is two years old.\n\nWhether or not it is worth the price depends on how much you value its\npowerful and bass-heavy sound.\n\n **Output Power: 12 Watts  \nInputs: Bluetooth, Aux  \nBattery Life: Up to 10 hours  \nDimensions: 2.3 x 7.1 x 2 inches  \nWeight: 1.5 pounds  \nIP Rating: N/A**\n\n[ Find more Bose SoundLink Mini II information and reviews here.\n](http://amzn.to/2EeOXQJ)\n\n  3. ##  3\\.

It reportedly survived a trip through one reviewer\u2019s washing machine.\n\nThis speaker has simple controls and a lanyard to carry it on the go.

This speaker is a little on the heavy\nside but is more than worth carrying along for its convenient suite of\nfeatures, starting with Bluetooth and NFC connectivity. It is easy to connect\nthe speaker, with an easy pairing button sitting among a myriad of other\ncontrols.\n\nThis includes volume up, volume down, one for speakerphone, one for\nplay/pause, one for power, and one to activate \u201cextra bass\u201d mode. The speaker\nitself isn\u2019t particularly sleek looking. I could take or leave the built-in\nmulticolor LEDs which flash along to the music. But the speaker itself is\nquite sturdy. It has an IP67 rating, rendering it safe from water and dust in\nall directions. The SRS-XB32 gets an impressive 24 hours battery life,\nassuming you don\u2019t use the lights or play at max volume constantly. It charges\nvia a proprietary DC power supply, but it makes up for this shortcoming by\nproviding a USB charge-out port next to its hidden aux port.\n\n[Click here to watch a video review of this\nspeaker.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lubjGSAZx0)\n\nAll that said, how does the SRS-XB32 sound? Pretty darn good. The speaker is\nclear and balanced out of the box, providing accurate playback even as it\napproaches max volume. Its frequency range spans the average spectrum of human\nhearing at 20Hz \u2013 20KHz. Those who like a punchy low-end can use the \u201cextra\nbass\u201d button to boost the bass frequencies, which sounds great on tracks that\nneed that driving subwoofer sound. Sony\u2019s free SongPal app further lets you\ntweak the experience with a three-band equalizer, plus program different LED\nlight patterns.\n\nAgain, its sound out of the box works great for faithful reproduction of\nmusic, but the added freedom to tweak the EQ allows you to adapt the sound to\nyour environment. The SRS-XB32 is one of the pricier portable speakers\navailable. But its huge selection of features makes it more than worth it for\nthe music enthusiast who loves to tweak settings. Want the same great sound\nand feature set in a larger form factor? The Sony XB41 is the XB32\u2019s kitchen\ntable alternative.\n\n **Output Power: (Unlisted)  \nInputs: Bluetooth, Aux, NFC  \nBattery Life: Up to 24 hours  \nDimensions: 9.1 x 3.5 x 3.3 inches  \nWeight: 1.9 pounds  \nIP Rating: IP67**\n\n[ Find more Sony SRS-XB32 information and reviews here.\n](https://amzn.to/2SBmzx1)\n\n  5. ##  5\\.

It is\nmeant to go along with you anywhere and comes with a suite of accessories like\na strap mount, a bike mount, and a remote control.\n\nIt can be driven over, dropped, dragged behind a car, you name it. There is no\nend to the abuse its shock-resistant frame will survive. It is also IP67 rated\nfor protection from dust and submersion in shallow water for up to 30 minutes.\n\nThis is far from the Fugoo Tough\u2019s only selling point, though. It also\ndelivers a pretty phenomenal sound. Its drivers are arranged to deliver 360\u00b0\nsound and offer a nearly full frequency response of 60Hz \u2013 20KHz.\n\nThe max volume is decent for indoor use, but if you actually take this\noutdoors or to a loud job site, the sound will disperse pretty fast.\n\nThe speaker is aptX compatible, which means that aptX compatible audio sources\nwill offer a higher playback quality than is capable through normal Bluetooth\nconnections.

It offers everything I like about the Mini\nII, plus some much-needed QOL upgrades to help it compete with newer speakers.\n\nThe downside is that the Revolve+ is a large speaker that weighs about 2\npounds. To its credit, it is one of the smaller in its class at about 4.13 x\n4.13 x 7.25 inches and has a lot of features to make it worth packing along.\nBut the Mini II is much smaller.\n\nThe Revolve+ has a durable aluminum body that can handle modest drops. The\nspeaker is IPX4 rated, making it rain and splash-proof as well.\n\nThe speaker also packs an above average 16-hour battery life. It recharges via\nmicro USB in about 4 hours.\n\nSimilar to the SoundLink Mini II, the Revolve+ brings beat-heavy sounds to\nlife with Bose\u2019s bass-boosted sound signature. The low end is full and\nsometimes boomy.\n\nThis high end is bright and clear as well, allowing for intricate details to\nflourish on the other end of the spectrum. The mids are somewhat understated,\nbut help blend the sound into a cohesive shape.\n\nAnother benefit of being a larger speaker is that the Revolve+ delivers some\nserious volume. There is no sign of distortion to be found even at 100%\nvolume.\n\n[Click here to watch a video review of this\nspeaker.](https://youtu.be/fNbegZ1sYfE)\n\nAtop the speaker, you have nice rubberized controls for power, Bluetooth,\nvolume up and down, a multipurpose tracking button, and a source button.\n\nThis speaker can play from Bluetooth, NFC, Aux, or USB audio. Note that the\naux playback is slightly delayed, which can be annoying if you ever use it to\nwatch videos.\n\nEven with its carry handle and durable case, the Revolve+ is a little big to\ntake with you everywhere.

This\nspeaker gets surprisingly loud and delivers a finely tuned sound that matches\nany sized room.\n\nThis speaker has aptX codec support, so aptX compatible devices deliver a\nhigher quality sound than you would normally get from Bluetooth.\n\nWith an effective frequency range of 68Hz \u2013 21KHz, the highest highs and the\nlowest lows come through accurately.\n\nThe low end is rich and spacious, and the high end is perfectly crisp. The\nonly downside to the sound is how you control it.\n\n[Click here to watch a video review of this\nspeaker.](https://youtu.be/SKg_sttSLdw)\n\nThe P2 goes for a minimalist approach with its controls, housing a lone power\nbutton on its anodized aluminum case.\n\nThe rest of the controls are handled by tap and shake interactions, which can\nbe programmed with the free Beoplay App.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a really clumsy way to handle things like track\nplayback and volume. In the end, it leaves me wishing for some plain \u2018ol\nbuttons.\n\nA lack of controls aside, the P2 is well put together.

Its two grilles\nallow it to deliver 360-degree sound. The speaker has a natural balance\nbetween the lows, mids, and highs, with a frequency range of 60-20,000 Hz.\n\nThe bass has a deep extension which provides lots of detail for hip hop and\nelectronic beats. The mids are clear yet somewhat warm, while the highs have\nplenty of room to breathe and make the song feel organic.\n\nThe only downside to the audio is that the speaker doesn\u2019t get very loud for\nits size. With a 10W amp and two 5W tweeters, one would certainly expect more\noomph than it has. This speaker does have a volume control knob up top to\nquickly boost your signal when needed, but it experiences some noticeable\ndistortion when you crank it past 8.\n\nThe Stockwell II also has knobs to control bass and treble if you like to make\non the go equalization adjustments. For what it\u2019s worth, I did most of my\ntesting with these dials set to 5. This top panel also has a power/sync button\nand an LED display to show battery remaining. This speaker has a fantastic\n20-hour battery life and recharges via USB-C.\n\nThough the Stockwell II is overall very well-built, with the exception of one\npossible weak point. The plastic case feels durable and the speaker is IPX4\nwater-resistant. Mind you, this score means it is only safe from splashing,\nbut still puts it above some of the competition. The steel grilles that cover\nthe speakers, however, don\u2019t feel as durable and may dent if you try to use\nthem like you would a rugged outdoors speaker.\n\nAs long as you don\u2019t need to take it camping or really crank the volume, the\nStockwell II is an incredible-sounding speaker that will also captivate avid\nknob twiddlers.\n\n **Output Power: 20 Watts**  \n **Inputs: Bluetooth**  \n **Battery Life: Up to 20 hours**  \n **Dimensions: 7 x 6 x 2.75 inches**  \n **Weight: 3 pounds**  \n **IP Rating: IPX4**\n\n[ Find more Marshall Stockwell II Bluetooth Speaker information and reviews\nhere. ](https://amzn.to/2EXkXXV)\n\n  9. ##  9\\.

It is only 5.7 x 6.2 x 3.7 inches.\n\nIts clear and natural sound signature is its main selling point, and it offers\nit at a bargain price. It does so by forgoing some more superfluous features\nyou find on portable speakers.\n\nFor instance, the speaker doesn\u2019t lend itself to rugged use, nor does it offer\na USB charge-out port. It does, however, have a decent built-in microphone for\nconference calls.\n\nThis means that this speaker is all about the sound, right down to its\nprominent circular shape. The sound is evenly balanced between high-end and\nlow-end, making for crisp and accurate playback.\n\n[Click here to watch a video review of this\nspeaker.](https://youtu.be/GgGifnFItAQ)\n\nThe passive bass port in the back gives the bass some nice extension without\ncramping the ever-important middle frequencies that carry the lead vocals and\nguitar riffs.\n\nThe high end is spacious, but the sound does get a little crunchy as you\napproach its max volume. However, if you are using this speaker at max volume,\na portable speaker may not be suited to your needs.\n\nMost speakers will pair up with another model of the same kind to double up on\naudio performance, but the Onyx Mini has a neat trick where three devices can\nbe connected at once, allowing you to take turns playing music.\n\nThis speaker has a max 10-hour battery life, which is just about average for\nBluetooth speakers. It has a handy array of five LEDs to keep track of its\nremaining charge.

Hundreds of\ndifferent brands compete to be your go-to option for portable listening.\n\nThat's why we put the highest-rated performers to the test to settle which\noptions can actually be called the best portable Bluetooth speakers.\n\nWhat exactly makes one Bluetooth speaker better than the other?\n\nThe obvious answer is sound quality. The best sounding Bluetooth speakers are\ncharacterized by clarity and balance. They should be able to reach a high\nvolume without distortion.\n\nBe sure to temper your expectations, though, as a speaker of limited size can\nonly put out so much power. Furthermore, Bluetooth transmission compresses\nyour audio data, somewhat muddying the signal.\n\nPortable speakers are supposed to sound good at high volumes without draining\ndown a small lithium-ion battery. They should not be thought of as devices for\naccurate critical listening.\n\nIf you had to use a Bluetooth speaker for focused listening, it should have\n[aptX support](https://www.aptx.com/about-aptx). AptX is an alternative\ncompression codec designed to better preserve the sonic qualities of your\nfiles.\n\nWhy doesn't every speaker have aptX support? _I have no idea_. But don't\nworry, because a Bluetooth speaker can still sound good without it.\n\nThe second most important element of a Bluetooth speaker is its form factor.\nIf you are planning to use this speaker on the go, it has to be both compact\nand durable. You'll also want the most battery life you can get.\n\nThen there are a number of additional features which aren't always necessary\nbut can be a must-have for some users. This includes a built-in microphone,\nUSB charge-out ports, and an auxiliary audio port.\n\nWith all of these factors existing in a fine balance, the right portable\nBluetooth speaker for you will entirely depend on your specific needs.\n\n## See Also\n\n[10 Best Home Bluetooth Speakers: The Ultimate\nList](https://heavy.com/tech/2018/03/best-home-bluetooth-wireless-speakers/)\n\n[11 Best Smart
