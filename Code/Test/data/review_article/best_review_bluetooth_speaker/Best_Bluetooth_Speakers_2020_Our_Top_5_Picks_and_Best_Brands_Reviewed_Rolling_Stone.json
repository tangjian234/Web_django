Some of the most popular speakers also come with smart home\ncapabilities, letting you control your music and your connected devices using\njust your voice.\n\nBest of all: the speakers on this list are easily paired with another speaker,\nletting you create a room \u2014 and house \u2014 full of rich, immersive and enveloping\nsound.\n\n### What Are the Best Bluetooth Speakers?\n\nThere are many factors to consider when choosing the best Bluetooth speaker\nfor you; below are the most important ones, which we considered while we were\nresearching this list.\n\n**Bluetooth:** We\u2019ve chosen Bluetooth speakers because the wireless standard\nhas been widely adopted, so our picks will work with your phone, tablet, or\ncomputer regardless of who makes it.\n\n**Battery:** Most of the speakers we\u2019re recommending are totally wireless,\nwhich means they run on battery power. Our minimum requirement was eight hours\nof music playback for charge, but many of our recommendations last a lot\nlonger.\n\n**Size and Weight:** One of the benefits of getting a wireless Bluetooth\nspeaker is the option to carry it around with you. Only one of the wireless\nspeakers in our guide weighs over three pounds, and is over eight inches tall.\nThe rest can be easily tucked into a bag or even your pockets.\n\n**Durability:** An electronic device\u2019s resistance to dust and water is\nmeasured on the IP (Ingress Protection) scale. Our minimum requirement for\nthis guide was an IPX4 rating, which means the speaker is protected from dust\nparticles larger than 1mm (millimeter), and splashes of water.\n\n**Multi-Speaker Pairing:** A relatively new feature to Bluetooth speakers is\nthe ability to pair two or more of them together to create a multi-room\nwireless audio system. All of the Bluetooth speakers we\u2019ve researched for this\nguide support this feature.\n\n### 1\\. Tribit StormBox Micro\n\n[![Tribit StormBox Micro](https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/Tribit-StormBox-\nMicro.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VSPPQXC?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\nCourtesy Amazon\n\nAmazon\n\nTribit is a name you may not have heard before, but I\u2019ve been testing the\ncompany\u2019s StormBox Micro for a couple of weeks, and like what I\u2019ve heard.\n\nThe speaker supports Bluetooth 5.0, the second latest version of the wireless\nstandard that\u2019s more energy-efficient. Tribit says the speaker gets eight\nhours of playback per charge, and that\u2019s been my experience. That lower\nbattery life is due to its relative small size: the speaker is a roughly\n3.7-inch square that\u2019s about 1.5 inches deep and weighs just over half a\npound. It\u2019s by far the smallest speaker in our guide, and very easy to carry\naround.\n\nDespite its size, the StormBox Micro delivers where it counts. It\u2019s earned an\nIP67 rating, which means it\u2019s dust-proof and can be held under 3.3 feet of\nwater for up to 30 minutes. More importantly, it sounds very good.\n\nTribit touts the speaker\u2019s bass, and they\u2019re not wrong. The bass is\nsurprisingly loud without overpowering the midrange and treble very much. I\nwill say that the speaker won\u2019t produce sound that\u2019s as clear as higher-end\nspeakers (it\u2019s not for audiophiles), but it is great for casually listening. I\nwas especially impressed at how easy it was to pair two StormBox Micros\ntogether. Once connected, you can use the speakers as a stereo pair, or as two\nmono speakers playing the same song simultaneously.\n\nFinally, the StormBox Micro has a strap you can use to attach it to a bike (as\nseen in the picture above), or around a shower head for bathroom listening. If\nyou\u2019re looking for a good sounding ultra portable speaker, this is our\nrecommendation.\n\n[ Buy: Tribit StormBox Micro $55.99\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VSPPQXC?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n[ Buy it\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VSPPQXC?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n### 2\\. JBL Charge 4\n\n[![JBL Charge 4](https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/JBL-\nCharge-4.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKQ6YGX?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\nCourtesy Amazon\n\nAmazon\n\nJBL\u2019s Charge 4 is the latest entry in the company\u2019s much loved mid-sized\nBluetooth speaker series.\n\nLike its predecessor, the Charge 4 supports Bluetooth 4.2, which is a fairly\nrecent version of the wireless standard. JBL says it gets 20 hours of battery\nlife per charge. The Charge 4 is tube-shaped, and measure 8.5 inches long, and\nroughly 3.5 wide and deep. This speaker has earned an IPX7 durability rating,\nwhich means it\u2019s totally dust-proof and can be be totally submerged under up\nto 3.3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes.\n\nI tried the previous version of this speaker and found the audio quality to be\nbetter than average, especially at high volumes. If you don\u2019t like the way it\nsounds out of the box, you can adjust its EQ (equalization) settings inside\nthe JBL Connect+ app. That same app allows you to pair up 100 JBL speakers\ntogether to create a massive wireless sound system. Another great feature\ncarried over from the previous generation Charge speaker is the ability to\npair two devices to the speaker at the same time. This allows multiple people\nto share DJ duties instead of one.\n\nIf durability and connectivity are your chief concerns, JBL\u2019s Charge 4 is the\nbest option in our guide.\n\n[ Buy: JBL Charge 4 $179.95\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKQ6YGX?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n[ Buy it\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKQ6YGX?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n### 3\\. Amazon Echo Plus (2nd Gen)\n\n[![amazon echo plus 2nd gen review best\nspeakers](https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/amazon-echo-\nplus-speakers-\nreview-e1548888808435.jpg?w=997)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0794W1SKP?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\nCourtesy Amazon\n\nAmazon\n\nOne of the main criticisms people had with Amazon\u2019s original Echo was the\nquality of its speakers. Amazon listened, and the Echo Plus (2nd Generation)\nis proof. This is the only Bluetooth speaker in our guide that needs to be\nplugged in all the time, but this comes with some big advantages.\n\nSpecs-wise, the Echo Plus (2nd Generation) holds up pretty well. Amazon\ndoesn\u2019t say which version of Bluetooth it supports, but I\u2019ve tested the\noriginal Amazon Echo, Echo Plus (1st Generation), and Echo Studio, and never\nhad a problem with connectivity. The Echo Plus (2nd Generation) weighs 1.72\npounds, is 5.8 inches tall, and measures 3.9 inches wide and deep. That makes\nit among the heaviest options in our guide, but you probably won\u2019t move it\naround as much. Adding to that, the Echo Plus (2nd Generation) is not water or\ndust-resistant at all, so you should keep it inside.\n\nThe main reason to get this Bluetooth speaker is that it has Amazon\u2019s Alexa\nsmart assistant built inside, which allows you to control it using your voice.\nYou can ask the Echo Plus (2nd Generation) to play music from popular services\nlike Spotify or Amazon\u2019s own Prime Music, ask it questions about the news or\nweather, and control smart-home devices. The reason we\u2019re recommending this\nEcho speaker over any other is that it has a Zigbee antenna inside, which\nallows it to connect directly with smart home devices that typically require a\nproprietary hub.\n\nAmazon is very up front about the audio hardware inside the Echo Plus (2nd\nGeneration), which is refreshing. It has a three-inch woofer to handle the\nbass and treble, and a 0.8-inch tweeter for treble. Having multiple drivers\n(the part of a speaker that creates sound) typically results in better\nbalance, and ultimately better sounding music. You can pair two Echo Pluses\ntogether to create a stereo pair, for even better performance.\n\nYou won\u2019t find a smarter Bluetooth speaker than Amazon\u2019s Echo Plus (2nd\nGeneration), and if you don\u2019t mind keeping it plugged in all the time, it\u2019s an\nexcellent choice.\n\n[ Buy: Echo Plus (2nd Gen) $79.99\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0794W1SKP?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n[ Buy it\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0794W1SKP?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n### 4\\. Bang & Olufsen A1 2nd Gen\n\n![Bang & Olufsen Beosound A1 2nd Gen](https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/Bang-Olufsen-Beosound-A1.jpg)\n\nCourtesy Amazon\n\nAmazon\n\nBang & Olufsen has a rich tradition of creating some of the best-looking and\nsounding speakers available anywhere, and the latest version of its A1 speaker\ncarries on that legacy.\n\nThe speaker supports Bluetooth 5.1, a just-ratified version of the wireless\nstandard, and gets up to 18 hours of battery life per charge. The speaker is\ndisc-shaped, measures 5.2 inches across, and 1.8 inches high, and weighs 1.23\npounds. It\u2019s earned an IP67 rating, which means it\u2019s totally dust-proof, and\ncan be submerged in up to 3.3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes.\n\nThe A1 (2nd Gen) is a 360-degree speaker, which means it uses its round domed\nshape to disperse sound in multiple directions. There\u2019s no \u201csweet spot\u201d you\nhave to be in to hear music clearly.\n\nDespite its small size, this speaker has a 3.5-inch woofer and 0.6-inch\ntweeter to create more well balanced sound. Bang and Olufsen says this speaker\nis \u201cideal for small social gatherings and mid-sized rooms around the home.\u201d It\nmay not shake the rafters, but this speaker is designed to be taken\neverywhere. Two A1 speakers can be connected to create a stereo pair.\n\nAudio quality is the most important prerequisite for recommending a speaker,\nbut the A1 2nd Gen can do a lot more than play music. It supports Amazon\u2019s\nAlexa, and when configured properly, it can be controlled entirely using your\nvoice. This includes adjusting its volume, playing music from streaming\nservices like Spotify and Prime music, and controlling smart-home accessories.\n\nNo speaker is perfect but Bang & Olufsen\u2019s A1 (2nd Gen) is a really well-\nrounded pick if you want to take a smart, small, great-sounding, and\nbeautifully-designed Bluetooth speaker everywhere you go.\n\n### 5\\. Ultimate Ears HYPERBOOM\n\n[![Ultimate Ears HYPERBOOM](https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/Ultimate-Ears-\nWonderboom.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8B9NV?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\nCourtesy Amazon\n\nAmazon\n\nThe top-of-the-line Bluetooth speaker in our guide is Ultimate Ears\u2019\nHYPERBOOM, a massive wireless speaker with a lot of punch.\n\nIt supports Bluetooth 5.0, the second latest version of the wireless standard\nthat\u2019s more energy-efficient, and gets up to 24 hours of battery life per\ncharge. That\u2019s the best battery life of any Bluetooth speaker we recommend,\nbut it comes at a cost: size. The HYPERBOOM is 14.4 inches tall, 7.5 inches\nwide and deep, and weighs 16.6 pounds.\n\nYes, this is a portable speaker, but not one you\u2019re likely to grab on your way\nout the door. That\u2019s especially true considering its IPX4 durability rating,\nwhich means it\u2019s dust-resistant to avoid damage from particles larger than 1mm\n(millimeter), and water-resistant enough to handle getting splashed. Think of\nit this way: sand can get inside, but crumbs wont; it\u2019ll work if you spill a\ndrink on it, but not if it gets caught in the rain.\n\nOn the audio front, the HYPERBOOM is well-equipped. It has multiple woofers,\ntweeters, and passive radiators, which should result in really well-balanced\nsound. To that end, the speaker supports a custom technology Ultimate Ears\ncalls \u201cadaptive EQ,\u201d which means the speaker will actively optimize the way it\nsounds based on where it\u2019s placed. If you take the speaker indoors and\noutdoors, you should notice a difference. If you don\u2019t like the way adaptive\nEQ works, you can always adjust the levels manually.\n\nThe HYPERBOOM can be connected to Ultimate Ears\u2019 other speakers to create a\nlarger wireless audio system, but not as a stereo pair. Four devices can be\nconnected to it at once, which allows you to share the DJ duty among even more\npeople.\n\nIf you regularly throw large parties, and want a speaker that uses AI to sound\nits best at all times, I highly recommend Ultimate Ears\u2019 HYPERBOOM.\n\n[ Buy: Ultimate Ears HYPERBOOM $399.99\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8B9NV?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n[ Buy it\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8B9NV?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\nIn This Article: [RS Recommends](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/rs-recommends/\n\"RS Recommends\"), [speakers](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/speakers/\n\"speakers\")\n\nWant more Rolling Stone?
