There are plenty of companies making Bluetooth speakers, but there\nare always those who rise to the top. From Sony to Bose, these are some of the\nbest Bluetooth speakers you can get on [Amazon](https://zdcs.link/QqknD) right\nnow. (Plus, if you're in the market for a Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or Prime\nDay deal, it's helpful to learn which devices are the best so when the sales\nstart you'll know what to buy.)\n\n## Best Sony Bluetooth speakers\n\nIf any company has been able to get its hands into nearly every space of\nconsumer/entertainment tech successfully, its Sony. From the PlayStation to\nthe selection of 4K TVs, Sony has been able to make and release products that\ncan be used in every aspect of daily life. And the same quality is found in\nSony's selection of Bluetooth speakers as well.\n\n### [Most reliable speaker](https://zdcs.link/92xy1)\n\n[ ![Uploads%252fcard%252fimage%252f835019%252fd2105bcc dc34 4909 9044\n5f99d43c2f0f.jpg%252f480x0.jpg?signature=tkg5bzd7gi2kpkbajyesuvw3pv4=&source=https%3a%2f%2fblueprint\napi\nproduction.s3.amazonaws](https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F835019%252Fd2105bcc-\ndc34-4909-9044-5f99d43c2f0f.jpg%252F480x0.jpg?signature=Tkg5BZd7Gi2kPkbaJYEsuvW3pv4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-\napi-production.s3.amazonaws.com)Image: Sony ](https://zdcs.link/92xy1)\n\nThe Good\n\nGood overall audio \u2022 Water resistant design \u2022 Can link with another XB10\nspeaker\n\nThe Bad\n\nBass could be better \u2022 Easily attracts dust \u2022 Can occasionally suffer\ndistortion\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIf you need a speaker that's affordable and consistent, the XB10 is the one to\nlook at.\n\n[\n\n## 1\\.

This is\nthe type of Bluetooth speaker to check out if you are looking at the smaller\nend of the spectrum. This speaker is able to strike a nice balance between\nsize and power compared to other speakers at this scale, especially as a one\nchannel speaker.  \nOne way that's established is the improved bass performance, which can always\nbe a question mark for small speakers. And with a 16-hour lifespan on the\nbattery and waterproof capabilities, you'll definitely get your money's worth.  \nSome 71% of users on Amazon have been happy with the speaker as well, giving\nit five stars. [M. Miller](https://zdcs.link/QOb3j) attests to the XB10's\nquality, saying:  \n\n> \"This little pod is a powerhouse for its size. We primarily listen to heavy\n> metal and it actually sounds decent. It\u2019s not like our full blown sound\n> system but we didn\u2019t expect it to.

It comes\nsporting some of the typical features, like the waterproof design, allowing\nfor flexible use. That said, the XB30 is a definite step-up in power to the\nXB10.  \nWhile the XB10 sports a one channel design, the XB30 uses a dual channel\ndesign since its a larger speaker. That also means that the XB30 is louder\nsimply because of the extra audio channel and can make the party that much\nmore enjoyable. It will also be able to last as long as you need it with a\n24-hour battery life.  \nCurrently on Amazon, 68% of users have given the XB30 five stars. A reviewer\nnamed [Jake](https://zdcs.link/z62KR) said this about the speaker:  \n\n> \"My dad had bought this and used it at work for some time and I followed up\n> and got one of my own.

That's\nwhere the [GTKXB90](https://zdcs.link/Q42Zd?pageview=03Jtuy2jQznBUgTSIxiO2U5)\ncomes in.  \nThe GTKXB90 is definitely on the larger scale for Sony's speakers. Because of\nthat, it delivers the best acoustic and bass audio thanks to three tweeters\nand two subwoofers. But don't let the size dissuade you, its still a portable\nspeaker. Aside from blasting music, it features a microphone input and\nchaining that make it ideal for presentations. The battery will last you about\n16 hours.  \nSome 62% of Amazon users have rated it five stars. [Miles\nKamaloski](https://zdcs.link/aRnGK) praised Sony's speaker, saying:  \n\n> \"The sound quality and battery life on this is amazing, I definitely\n> recommend this over the other models due to its high battery life and\n> additional speakers.

That doesn't mean JBL skimped on\nfeatures, though.  \nThanks to the body's design, the Clip 2 is one of the more durable speakers\nout there. Not only is it waterproof, but the materials will make sure it\nsurvives other trials daily life might deliver. It can also be daisy chained\nwith another Clip 2 to bump up the sound. And with an 8-hour battery life, it\nwill help pass time during anything from day-long hikes to your bike commute\ninto the office.  \nUsers on Amazon have been happy with the speaker as well.
