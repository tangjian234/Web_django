We know we can, but it doesn't\nsound like a planet we want to live on \u2013 having to listen to dubstep-reggae-\nmetal or whatever blasting from the loudspeaker of someone else's phone would\nbe a bummer. Of course, the convenience to listen to anything in private is\nnot all there is to love about earphones. Today's models are comfy, portable,\nand sound pretty darn good, especially if you invest in a high-quality set of\ncans.\n\n  \n\nJohn C. Koss is one of the many people we have to thank for the advancement of\nheadphones. In 1958, this fine gentleman gave the world the first\nstereophones, as they were called. They weren't the first headphones ever\nmade, but they were the first set of mass-market headphones made for music\nlistening capable of producing stereo sound of good quality \u2013 quite an\ninnovation for a time when if you used a pair, you were most likely a\ntelephone or radio operator.\n\n  \n\nThe headphones we're focusing on today, however, are a bit different from the\nstereophones of Mr. Koss. We've put together a list of the best Bluetooth\nheadphones \u2013 the models with the best sound, best battery life, best design,\nand best features money can buy right now. Check them out and let us know\nwhich one suits your preferences best!\n\n  \n\n## Best high-end wireless headphones, a summarized list:\n\n  * Jabra Elite 85H\n  * Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H9 3rd gen\n  * Sony WH-1000XM3\n  * Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700\n  * Master & Dynamic MW65\n  * Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 3\n  * Beyerdynamic Amiron Wireless\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Jabra Elite 85H\n\n  \n\n[![Best high-end Bluetooth wireless headphones money can buy in\n2020](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/358513-image/jabra-\nelite-85h.jpg)\n\nDesign| Around the ear, closed back, folds inward  \n---|---  \nWeight| 10.4 oz (295 grams)  \nBattery life| 36 hours (with ANC on)  \nConnectivity| Bluetooth 5.0, no aptX  \n  \n  \n\nSome might think that this pair doesn't deserve to be here since compared to\nothers on this list it's straight up cheap. However, Jabra has managed to\nsqueeze plenty of audio prowess into its Elite 85H and make them worth\nconsidering if you're looking for great sound quality without spending half a\ngrand.\n\n  \n\nOf course, the Jabra Elite 85H comes with a few sacrifices compared to the\ncompetition around here. The design is rather dull and there aren't any fancy\nmaterials used, so if you're looking for a pair that compliments your dress to\nimpress outfit, that's not it.\n\n  \n\n[Buy Jabra Elite85H from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2xXMiIt)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H9 3rd gen\n\n  \n\n[![Best high-end Bluetooth wireless headphones money can buy in\n2020](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/358514-image/bang-\nand-olufsen-h9.jpg)\n\nDesign| Around the ear, closed back, folds flat  \n---|---  \nWeight| 10.0 oz (285 grams)  \nBattery life| 25 hours (with ANC on)  \nConnectivity| Bluetooth 4.2, no aptX  \n  \n  \n\nAs most other audio products by the well-known brand, the Bang & Olufsen\nBeoplay H9 stands out with its modern design and classy appearance. This set\nof earphones uses soft lambskin for the earcups and cowhide leather for the\nheadband, while the sturdy mechanisms are made of metal. Touch controls let\nyou change to volume or skip songs, and placing your whole palm over them\nenables Transparency Mode which turns off the active noise cancellation and\nlets ambient sound through.\n\n  \n\nThe third generation comes with improved battery life and a dedicated [Google\nAssistant](http://amzn.to/2yGvOQI \"view on Amazon\") button, but unfortunately\nstill no Bluetooth 5.0. Despite that, if you have the money to splurge on\nthese, you won't be disappointed.\n\n  \n\n[Buy Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H9 3rd gen from\nAmazon.com](https://amzn.to/2JKFJfd)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Sony WH1000XM3\n\n  \n\n[![Best high-end Bluetooth wireless headphones money can buy in\n2020](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/337744-image/03-Sony-\nWH-1000XM3-headphones-Review-006.jpg)\n\nDesign| Around the ear, closed back, folds flat or inward  \n---|---  \nWeight| 9.0 oz (255 grams)  \nBattery life| 30 hours (with ANC on)  \nConnectivity| Bluetooth 4.2 with aptX HD and LDAC; NFC pairing  \n  \n  \n\nSony's latest high-end earphones won't exactly wow you with premium design.\nThe name isn't particularly memorable either. But when we tried them, the Sony\nWH1000X Mark 3 blew us away with their superb noise-cancelling abilities. If\npeace and quiet is what you value, these should be on the top of your\nshortlist. Battery life is also very good with this pair of headphones, making\nit ideal for frequent flyers.\n\n  \n\n[Buy Sony WH1000XM3 from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2JJqO4T)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700\n\n  \n\n[![Best high-end Bluetooth wireless headphones money can buy in\n2020](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/358515-image/bose-\nnoise-canceling-headphones-700.jpg)\n\nDesign| Around the ear, closed back, folds inward  \n---|---  \nWeight| 8.8 oz (250 grams)  \nBattery life| 20 hours (with ANC on)  \nConnectivity| Bluetooth 5.0, no aptX; NFC pairing  \n  \n  \n\nIf great active noise cancellation is what you're looking for in a pair of\nheadphones, the Bose NC Headphones 700 is another option worth exploring. This\npair is meant to directly compete with the Sony WH-1000XM3, but it looks\nbetter and is made out of more premium materials. Active noise cancelling is\npretty much on par with the Sonys, which is quite a compliment in itself. The\n700s come with support for Google Assistant and [Amazon\nAlexa](http://amzn.to/2AN4kdy \"view on Amazon\") and touch controls this time\naround.\n\n  \n\nThe 20-hour battery life is slightly disappointing for over-the-ear headphones\nbut unless you travel across the world on a regular basis, it shouldn't be a\nproblem.\n\n  \n\n[Buy Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 from\nAmazon.com](https://amzn.to/3bPBWcy)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Master & Dynamic MW65\n\n  \n\n[![Best high-end Bluetooth wireless headphones money can buy in\n2020](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/358531-image/master-\ndynamic-MW65.jpg)\n\nDesign| Around the ear, closed back, folds flat or inward  \n---|---  \nWeight| 8.6 oz (245 grams)  \nBattery life| 24 hours (with ANC on)  \nConnectivity| Bluetooth 4.2 with aptX  \n  \n  \n\nThe message these headphones send is pretty obvious: \"I have a lot of money\nand I'm not afraid to spend it.\" But we must admit that the Master & Dynamic\nMW65 look outstanding, made using ample amounts of leather and metal. They're\na big improvement over the MW60s, adding 8 more hours of battery life and\nactive noise cancellation, making the premium price much more justifiable. A\nlot of the weight has been shed as well, improving comfort during prolonged\nuse.\n\n  \n\n[Buy Master & Dynamic MW65 from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2XhMzku)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless\n\n  \n\n[![Best high-end Bluetooth wireless headphones money can buy in\n2020](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/358535-image/61vlqbQTFpL.-AC-\nSL1200-.jpg)\n\nDesign| Around the ear, closed back, folds inward  \n---|---  \nWeight| 10.7 oz (303 grams)  \nBattery life| 17 hours (with ANC on)  \nConnectivity| Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX  \n  \n  \n\nAnother pair of headphones with design that makes a statement. The Momentum 3\nWireless look good and sound even better. Sennheiser has packed them with the\nbest tech it has available and the result is a pair of banging cans.\nUnfortunately, the minimalist design comes with a sacrifice: battery life.\nWith barely 17 hours of playback time with ANC on, this pair lasts almost half\nthe time other headphones do. If sound is what matters most to you, however,\nthese are some of the best-sounding [wireless\nheadphones](https://amzn.to/2S2D9Dc \"view on Amazon\") out there right now.\n\n  \n\n[Buy Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2V8l5ef)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Beyerdynamic Amiron Wireless\n\n  \n\n[![Best high-end Bluetooth wireless headphones money can buy in\n2020](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/358539-image/beyerdynamic-\namiron-wireless.jpg)\n\nDesign| Around the ear, closed back, don't fold  \n---|---  \nWeight| 13.4 oz (380 grams)  \nBattery life| 30+ hours (no ANC)  \nConnectivity| Bluetooth 4.2 with aptX  \n  \n  \n\nWith the Beyerdynamic Amiron Wireless, we're reaching peak audio quality. This\npair is for those that put sound quality above all and want to get the best no\nmatter the price. Going beyond the superior sound, however, those are an odd\npair of wireless headphones. The build quality is excellent but it seems they\naren't meant to be used outside much. First, they're very bulky, second, the\ncarrying case is enormous because they don't fold and third, they don't have\nactive noise cancelling. They are, however, perfect for enjoying your favorite\nmusic all around your house without worrying about disturbing the neighbors or\nother members of your household. The Beyerdynamic Amiron Wireless are the true\naudiophile Bluetooth headphones.\n\n  \n\n[Buy Beyerdynamic Amiron Wireless from Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/34fTRGC)\n\n  \n\n[ ![Best wireless
