Institute Team](/uk/author/531453/the-good-\nhousekeeping-institute-team/)\n\n07/02/2019\n\nGood Housekeeping\n\nWireless headphones mean you can enjoy everything from your favourite album to\nthe latest podcast episode without having to attach a cable to your phone or\ntablet. But with a huge choice in on-ear, in-ear and totally wireless\nheadphones out there, picking the right pair for you can be a minefield.\n\n**The best wireless headphones  \n**[Smartphone](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/product-\nreviews/tech/g23889694/best-smartphones/) manufacturers from Apple and Google\nto Sony and Samsung have ditched the 3.5mm headphone socket on their products,\nso there's no doubt that wireless headphones are the future. Prices can start\nfrom as little as \u00a320, but if you want the best sound quality and comfort they\ncan cost over \u00a3200. We've included both the best money can buy and some\ncheaper options under \u00a350 on this list.\n\n **In-ear or on-ear headphones  \n**[In-ear headphones](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/product-\nreviews/g684326/best-bluetooth-in-ear-headphones/) are the most commonly seen\ntype of headphone. You insert them directly into your ear canal, and they\nusually come with a range of silicone ear tips. These earphones are highly\nportable and you can find wireless versions with a cable connecting the two\nearbuds, a neckband (made of flexible material or hard plastic) and [true\nwireless earphones](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/product-\nreviews/g684571/best-truly-wireless-headphones/) which don't have anything\njoining the left and right earbud together. If you find in-ear headphones\nuncomfortable, though, [on-ear\nheadphones](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/product-\nreviews/tech/g684413/best-on-ear-bluetooth-headphones/) may be a better fit.\nThese sit on your ears and have pads made of materials like foam or leather\nfor added comfort.\n\n **Key features to consider  \n** Look for a pair of [noise-cancelling\nheadphones](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/product-\nreviews/tech/g23918336/best-noise-cancelling-headphones/) if you'll be\nlistening in a loud environment such as a busy train or when you\u2019re flying.
