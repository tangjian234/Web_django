Now, with big names \u2014 think Beats, Bang & Olufsen and Skullcandy \u2014\nmaking a slew of quality devices that bump some serious sound quality, the\nfield has blossomed into one ripe with choice.\n\nSo we\u2019ve cut out the guesswork and found the best on-ear headphones on the\nmarket \u2014 in terms of sound quality, comfort, design and value. After poring\nthrough numerous expert reviews, checking out the most popular brands and\nusing our knowledge of the headphones market, we decided on a pool of eight\non-ear headphones to put to the test, ranging from $40 to $400. We tested\nacross six categories, including sound quality, comfort and battery life.\n\nSound quality was the most important criterion in our testing. And we did\nconsider active noise cancellation (ANC) as another element, but it was\nweighted lower, as that feature is found less in on-ear headphones. (You can\nread up on our top picks for noise-canceling headphones here.)\n\nOver the course of a few months, we spent more than a week with each pair. And\nafter a fair share of head-bopping playlists and too many drained batteries to\ncount, we settled on three standouts. As is always our aim, we wanted to\nensure the headphones we highlight here provide the most value in terms of\nquality across all categories. In our testing, we found that while the\nsub-$100 headphones have highlights in one or two areas, none of them provide\nthe overall quality we were looking for, and therefore we think you\u2019re better\noff spending a bit more for some truly great on-ear headphones.\n\n###  The best on-ear headphones\n\n  * **Best overall on-ear headphones:** [Beats Solo 3](https://amzn.to/3fzPCLh)\n  * **Runner-up:** [Bowers & Wilkins PX5](https://amzn.to/3ciuPKd)\n  * **The luxury pick:** [Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H8i](https://amzn.to/3dtywNi)\n\n###  The short of it\n\nThe [Beats Solo 3s](https://amzn.to/3fzPCLh) are a phenomenal pair of on-ear\nheadphones. Their sound quality was among the top of those we tested, pumping\nout particularly clear vocals and instrumentals alike. We enjoyed the control\nscheme too, taking the form of buttons in a circular configuration that blend\nseamlessly into the left ear cup design. They are also light, comfortable and\nare no slouch in the looks department \u2014 more than you\u2019d expect given their\nreasonable $199.95 price tag.\n\nFor an additional $100, the [Bowers & Wilkins PX5s](https://amzn.to/3ciuPKd)\nalso have terrific sound quality and particularly shine with their deep,\nsatisfying bass. But, most importantly, they also include strong noise-\ncanceling abilities, a feature absent in our overall pick. They\u2019re made of\nquality materials and have a respectable battery life, and the only factor\nthat kept them from creeping up into our top spot was their somewhat lofty\nprice of $298.98.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t normally highlight headphones with such an exorbitant price, but\nthe [$400 Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H8is](https://amzn.to/3dtywNi) sport some\nunusually luxurious touches that we wanted to point out for those willing to\nsplurge. Among them: a cowhide headband and cozy lambskin ear cups along with\nsuperlative sound quality and ANC. If your budget allows, these are worth\nconsidering.\n\n###  The long of it\n\n[**Best Overall On-Ear Headphones: Beats Solo 3**](https://amzn.to/3fzPCLh)\n\n![](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200508124558-underscored-best-on-\near-headphones-beats-solo-3-live-video.jpg)\n\nPHOTO: Benjamin Levin/CNN\n\n**Why we love it in a sentence:** _The Beats Solo 3s are a superb pair of on-\near headphones that may lack noise cancelation, but more than make up for it\nin sound quality, design, battery capacity \u2014 and price._\n\nThe [Beat Solo 3s](https://amzn.to/3fzPCLh) were released back in 2016, which\nin headphones years means they\u2019re basically living their golden years. But\ndespite their age, they consistently held their own during our testing. They\nwere often neck-and-neck with headphones twice their price, if not flat-out\nsurpassing them.\n\nThe Solo 3s produced sound you\u2019d expect from a much more expensive pair of\nheadphones. Instrumental and vocal clarity were among the best we\u2019ve heard.\nThe drums, saxophone and synthesizers of [\u201cJazz Crimes\u201d by Joshua\nRedman](https://amzn.to/3bjLAn0) came through with amazing clarity. Every drum\nbeat popped, even during the song\u2019s busier moments with multiple instruments\nplaying simultaneously. During [\u201cYour Best American\nGirl,\u201d](https://amzn.to/2SKBK7q) you might swear you were in the recording\nstudio with Mitski as she sang and strummed the guitar.\n\nThe Solo 3s put on quite a performance when it came time to bring the bass,\nactually besting their successors,[ the Beats Solo\nPros](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/cnn-underscored/beats-solo-pro-\nreview/index.html). [\u201cBad Guy\u201d by Billie Eilish](https://amzn.to/2YSdROO) had\nlots of depth as well as a nice physical kick to the audio. And while the\n[PX5s](https://amzn.to/3ciuPKd) and [H8is ](https://amzn.to/3dtywNi)topped the\nSolo 3s in this category, the scores were very close \u2014 primarily coming down\nto differences in their overall intensity. This was most apparent during\n[\u201cModerplan Jesus\u201d by Portugal. The Man](https://amzn.to/2yFDacf), which\nrelies more on subtle bass with a substantial kick rather than depth alone.\nStill, the Solo 3s provided bass we could rock out to. Their performance was\nclose behind that of the PX5s and H8is, despite costing much less.\n\nThese headphones provide an invigorating sense of 3D sound, too. We could tell\nexactly where the instruments were in space while listening to [\u201cI\u2019m on Fire\u201d\nby Bruce Springsteen](https://amzn.to/3fvZYvE). The experience made us feel as\nif we were on stage with him, and his voice rang out with equally impressive\nresonance. Never did a song feel flattened or below its intended quality. This\nwas true even during the intense saxophone peaks of [Joshua Redman\u2019s \u201cJazz\nCrimes.\u201d](https://amzn.to/2SQK3P4) And, as we discussed above, the Solo 3s\ncould handle the unusually deep troughs of Billie Eilish\u2019s \u201cBad Guy\u201d without\nissue.\n\nThese headphones can make and take calls, so we rang up some people to put\nthem to the test, and what we found was good call quality overall. Our\nrecipients generally described us as sounding \u201cpretty good,\u201d with reasonable\nvocal clarity. For comparison, our voices were much more muffled during calls\nwith the [Bowers & Wilkins PX5s](https://amzn.to/3ciuPKd), while the [Beoplay\nH8is](https://amzn.to/3dtywNi) calls delivered a slightly higher voice quality\nthan the [Beats Solo 3](https://amzn.to/3fzPCLh).\n\nThe Solo 3s were also a breeze to operate. Most of the buttons reside on a cap\natop the left ear cup. They are well integrated into the design, with a large\ncenter button performing most functions, including playback, track skipping,\ncall control and Siri (holding the button down will summon her). Around this\nbutton is a ring; pressing in the top increases the volume, and vice versa on\nthe bottom. The buttons do produce a noticeable clicking sound, but not enough\nto find distracting. The power button is on the opposite cup with a row of\nLEDs beneath it that indicate remaining battery life. The controls were easy\nto learn, and it\u2019s not hard to find them with your hand while you\u2019re jamming\nout.\n\nThe plastic employed in these headphones seems substantial \u2014 with material\nthat feels higher quality than that used on most of the other devices we\ntested, but also decidedly lower in quality than the PX5s\u2019 and H8is\u2019 material.\nThe inner skeleton is metal, but it doesn\u2019t add much heft to the device.\nOverall, these headphones are slim and light. The ear cups also fold in so you\ncan stow them in the included carrying case.\n\nVisually, these headphones are remarkable across all nine colorways (including\nvibrant options). The plastic shell on the headband flows continuously toward\nthe ear cups, becoming the circular caps on top of them. The cushion inside\nthe headband merges seamlessly with the adjacent plastic as it, too, curves\ntoward the ear cups. Though there\u2019s not much cushioning to speak of, the\ndevice manages to be very comfortable. Not only are the ear cup cushions high-\nquality, but the headphones are also only about 7.5 ounces, so the device\ndoesn\u2019t put much pressure on your head.\n\nBehind the beauty and power of the Solo 3s is an equally substantial battery:\nThe [Beats Solo 3](https://amzn.to/3fzPCLh) are capable of a little more than\n40 hours of playback. That, in a word, is bonkers \u2014 you\u2019ll rarely have to plug\nthese in. And better yet, they feature a quick charge that\u2019ll give you three\nhours of battery life from just a five-minute charge.\n\nAs we mentioned above, the [Beats Solo 3](https://amzn.to/3fzPCLh) are rather\nold, having debuted back in 2016. The Bowers & Wilkins PX5s, on the other\nhand, were released in 2019, and the Beoplay H8is came out in 2018. Even so,\nit\u2019s clear these headphones are still up to snuff. They also still contain\nApple\u2019s H1 chip, which powers AirPods (just not AirPods Pro) to this day and\nprovides super fast Bluetooth pairing. Furthermore, Apple offers a one-year\nwarranty, plus two years and two incidents of accidental damage coverage, with\nAppleCare+.\n\nBy the time we were done with the Beats Solo 3, we had even more respect for\nBeats. They\u2019re capable of audio quality like few others, comfortable, and\ntotally easy on the eyes. Even without ANC, these headphones scored on top of\nour list, deserving of the title of best on-ear headphones. [At $199.95 (and\noften on sale for less), this pair continues to withstand the test of\ntime](https://amzn.to/3fzPCLh).\n\n[**Runner-Up: Bowers & Wilkins PX5**](https://amzn.to/3ciuPKd)\n\n![](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200508124705-underscored-best-on-\near-headphones-bowers-wilkins-live-video.jpg)\n\nPHOTO: Benjamin Levin/CNN\n\n**Why we love it in a sentence:** _The Bowers & Wilkins PX5s combine amazingly\nauthentic audio and bass with excellent ANC into a beautiful, sensibly\ndesigned pair of on-ear headphones._\n\nWe had a great time with the [Bowers & Wilkins PX5s](https://amzn.to/3ciuPKd).\nThey look, feel and sound professional, doing well or best on about every test\nwe threw at them. And while they were surpassed by the Beats Solo 3 in terms\nof comfort and most audio quality measures, they have a sleek control system\nand slightly better bass. And of course, these headphones feature great ANC.\n\nThe Bowers & Wilkins headphones produce considerable sound quality.\nInstrumentals and vocals had exceptional clarity. Complex jazz pieces such as\n[\u201cJazz Crimes\u201d by Joshua Redman](https://amzn.to/2SQK3P4) showed off this\nquality with authentic saxophone playback and crisp drum medleys. And during\n[\u201cBad Guy\u201d by Billie Eilish](https://amzn.to/2YSdROO), it felt like she was\nwhispering right in our ear, while a deep and punchy bass made it impossible\nnot to head-bob.\n\nListening to [\u201cI\u2019m on Fire\u201d by Bruce Springsteen](https://amzn.to/3fqJvJn)\nreally provided a sense of 3D sound. The positions of instruments are\nauthentically represented, and feel as if they\u2019re surrounding you in real\nspace. Bruce\u2019s voice comes out clear as day, too. We did detect some minute\novercompression, which slightly muted higher-pitched notes. For example,\nduring [\u201cJazz Crimes,\u201d](https://amzn.to/2SQK3P4) the highest saxophone peaks\nare slightly reduced in volume. It\u2019s not enough to be distracting, but the\ndiscerning ear will detect it. What\u2019s more, the accurate playback and\nmasterful bass more than made up for that shortcoming. Overall, the [PX5s\u2019\n](https://amzn.to/3ciuPKd)sound quality very nearly matched that of the more\nexpensive [Beoplay H8is](https://amzn.to/3dtywNi).\n\nThe only real crack in the armor was call quality. Recipients consistently\nreported a muffled voice quality coming through the PX5s microphone, and phone\ncall voices heard through them sounded too loud at times.\n\nThe [Bowers & Wilkins PX5s](https://amzn.to/3ciuPKd) also delivered well on\nANC. We tried them out with a noisy washing machine nearby, and they were able\nto cancel out a good range of bass and higher-frequency sounds made by the\nmachine, as well as reduce the occasional sound of zippers clanking against\nthe metal machine. Our other test involved playing a soundtrack of a noisy\nrestaurant crowd from nearby speakers. This yielded similar results \u2014 deeper\nsound was cut out well, and higher-pitched voices and noises were dampened to\na satisfying level. The Beoplay H8is proved able to dampen a wider range of\nlow-frequency sound, but we were still happy with the PX5s\u2019 ANC (and it\u2019s\nworth noting that most of the on-ear headphones we tested don\u2019t feature ANC at\nall).\n\nThe usability of these headphones was one of the qualities that set it apart\nfrom the others. On the right ear cup, you\u2019ll find a row of three buttons for\nplayback, call control and smart assistance activation (Siri and Google\nAssistant). The center button, which operates most of the device\u2019s functions,\nis raised so you can tell you\u2019re touching it without having to look. Beneath\nthat is a switch, wherein the middle position turns on the headphones and the\nfarthest position activates Bluetooth pairing. On the left ear cup is a button\nthat lets you adjust the ANC strength. These are the only headphones on this\nlist that let you change this. They can also be connected to multiple devices\nat once, a capability that the[ Beats Solo 3](https://amzn.to/3fzPCLh) lack.\nWhile most of the headphones we tested share one or some of these great\nfeatures, the PX5s are the only pair with every single one.\n\nAdditionally, the Bowers & Wilkins companion app enables control over a number\nof the device\u2019s features, like a standby timer, the ability to toggle voice\nprompts (which inform you of, for instance, battery level and pairing mode)\nand a number of relaxing soundscapes to listen to (we were partial to the\ncrackling campfire, but others include a babbling brook, a seaside beach, and\na waterfall).\n\nThe [PX5s](https://amzn.to/3ciuPKd) pack a respectable battery capacity\nthat\u2019ll last you an entire day. At 20 hours with ANC on and more with the\nfeature turned off, you shouldn\u2019t have to return to an outlet frequently. And\nwhen you do, you\u2019ll enjoy a terrific quick charge. In just 15 minutes, these\nheadphones will gain five hours of battery life. So if you forgot to charge\nthem for a while, you won\u2019t be left in silence for too long.\n\nThese headphones are built with quality materials, surpassing the [Beats Solo\n3](https://amzn.to/3fzPCLh) in construction. They feature a sleek, sturdy\nheadband with minor cushioning inside. The headband arms are composed of a\nthick, high-quality plastic and extend to hold the ear cups, which are ovular\nwith a metal section protruding on the outside and thick cushioning on the\ninside. Overall, they were fairly comfortable, though the ear cups tended to\nsqueeze the head after some time if not adjusted. And though the build quality\nis high, these headphones are on the heftier side at about 9 ounces, so the\nheadband was prone to applying more pressure.\n\n[In short, we had a great experience with the Bowers & Wilkins\nPX5s](https://amzn.to/3ciuPKd). Their audio performance, ANC ability and build\nquality are some of the best we\u2019ve seen in on-ear headphones, with a\nprofessional, minimalistic design that we can\u2019t help but gawk at. If you\u2019re\nlooking for powerful, attractive, ANC-capable on-ear headphones, and aren\u2019t\nturned off by the $300 price tag, you\u2019ve found your pair.\n\n[**The Luxury Pick: Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H8i**](https://amzn.to/3dtywNi)\n\n![](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200508124623-underscored-best-on-\near-headphones-beoplay-live-video.jpg)\n\nPHOTO: Benjamin Levin/CNN\n\n**Why we love it in a sentence:** _The Beoplay H8is are finely crafted on all\nfronts, featuring lambskin ear cups, genuine cowhide on the headband, and\nexquisite sound quality and ANC that comes with a premium price._\n\nThe [Beoplay H8is ](https://amzn.to/3dtywNi)had a sublime sound quality beyond\nwhat we could have imagined in a pair of on-ear headphones. Playback of [\u201cI\u2019m\non Fire\u201d by Bruce Springsteen](https://amzn.to/3fqJvJn) showed off\nexceptionally clear vocals and an authentic 3D soundstage. Like the Beats Solo\n3s, the H8is could faithfully reproduce instrument positions. Along with\namazing vocals, it\u2019s easy to close your eyes and imagine yourself in the\nperformance. The guitar in [\u201cYour Best American Girl\u201d by\nMitski](https://amzn.to/3dqcQBK), for instance, sounded like it was being\nplucked right next to us. The H8is also performed flawlessly on compression,\nhandling the saxophone peaks in [\u201cJazz Crimes\u201d by Joshua\nRedman](https://amzn.to/2WCcVf0) without muting them or making them shrill.\nBass was a similar story; the H8is have an unmatched range of depth, able to\nplay the bass in [Billie Eilish\u2019s \u201cBad Guy\u201d](https://amzn.to/2YSdROO) with the\nthunderous intensity intended by the artist.\n\nThese headphones outperformed the [Beats Solo 3s](https://amzn.to/3fzPCLh) on\nbass by a good margin. The difference was primarily apparent in songs with\nsubtler bass than in [Billie Eilish\u2019s \u201cBad Guy,\u201d](https://amzn.to/2YSdROO)\nsuch as[ Portugal. The Man\u2019s \u201cModern Jesus.\u201d](https://amzn.to/3ciWAlV) The\nchorus takes advantage of bass as a strong, almost atmospheric beat that the\nH8is fantastically fulfill. The Solo 3s, on the other hand, have great depth,\nbut not enough intensity to provide the same element.\n\nThe H8is put out the best call quality out of our top picks. Voices sounded\nnotably less muffled than they did on competitors. It\u2019s worth noting that call\nquality was only slightly better than the [Solo 3s](https://amzn.to/3fzPCLh)\nbut far better than the muffled, poorly compressed calls on the PX5s.\n\nThe Bang & OIufsen app was another highlight. This companion app provides\ntremendous control over your device and music. You can toggle ANC, check\nbattery life, hook up Google Assistant to your device and more. But best of\nall, you have access to a \u201cmood wheel,\u201d which works like an equalizer and\nenables you to tailor audio settings to match moods like \u201crelaxed\u201d or\n\u201cenergetic.\u201d When you drag the mood toward \u201cenergetic,\u201d for example, the\ntreble and bass are both boosted, while a \u201ccommute\u201d preset boosts the bass and\n\u201cworkout\u201d lowers the treble slightly.\n\nThe [H8is](https://amzn.to/3dtywNi) really blew us away when it came to ANC.\nDuring both of our tests, these headphones decimated deep, bassy sounds. They\nwere better able to mute the rumble that accompanies the sound of a noisy\nwashing machine than the[ PX5s](https://amzn.to/3ciuPKd). When we stepped up\nto the machine, it was hard to believe the difference with them on versus off.\nAnd when listening to a sound clip of restaurant crowd ambience on nearby\nspeakers, we found the deep droning hum of the crowd was entirely muted. This\nis even better performance than many over-ear headphones, which don\u2019t often\ncover as many deep frequencies.\n\nThe H8is\u2019 volume-reducing prowess was equally clear to us. This was most\napparent during the crowd sound clip, where a cacophony of voices was quieted\nto something more akin to a library conversation. Even the abrupt sounds of\nclosing doors and clinking silverware were no match for this ANC. By the way,\nthese headphones also feature transparency mode. This feature amplifies nearby\nsounds rather than dampening them so you can tune into your environment.\n\nAs the name implies, on-ear headphones rest directly on your ears, which can\ncreate some pretty uncomfortable squeezing without proper padding. And, in\ngeneral, companies seem to have a difficult time coming up with a comfortable\nsetup. Beoplay succeeded with flying colors, integrating materials and tech\ninto the H8is that go a long way toward justifying their $400 price tag. They\nweigh in at just 8 ounces, which is light relative to headphones of similar\nquality, such as the 9-ounce [Bowers & Wilkins PX5s](https://amzn.to/3ciuPKd).\n\nThe ear cups on the [H8is](https://amzn.to/3dtywNi) are memory foam lined with\nlambskin, making them incredibly soft on the ears \u2014 almost unnoticeable, in\nfact, as they mitigate the pressure you might normally feel from on-ear\nheadphones. The headband has fairly rigid cushioning, but the H8is are so\nlightweight the band simply rests comfortably on your head. Inside is a\nlightweight aluminum bar that makes the headphones both light and flexible.\nAcross the top of the headband is genuine cowhide, resulting in a durable and\nvisually stunning design. Beige, black and pink are your options for color on\nthis device. And while the H8is don\u2019t fold up for portability, they do include\na carrying bag.\n\nThe controls on these headphones are sleek and intuitive. On the right earcup\nis a row of three buttons. The center button, which controls playback and\ntrack skipping, has a bump so you can differentiate it from the others; the\ntop and bottom button control volume. On the left earcup is a switch that\nallows you to toggle ANC in one position and transparency mode in another \u2014\nand the switch doubles as the power button, which we thought was a pretty\nclever consolidation of controls.\n\nThe [H8is](https://amzn.to/3dtywNi) provide a great amount of battery life, to\nboot. With ANC on, they reached 30 hours, and exceeded that with ANC off. This\nis 10 more hours than the PX5s get with ANC on. The only downside was a lack\nof quick charge, which you get with both the Beats Solo 3s (three hours in\nfive minutes) and the Bowers & Wilkins PX5s (five hours in 15 minutes).\n\nIn the end, the H8is produced better sound than the [Solo\n3s](https://amzn.to/3fzPCLh). They are more comfortable (thanks to materials\nseldom found on headphones) and scored slightly better on bass. And,\nnaturally, they feature ANC while the Beats Solo 3s do not. The kicker,\nthough, was the price. The Beats Solo 3s deliver a pretty similar experience\non just about every aspect at half the price. Still, the [Beoplay\nH8is](https://amzn.to/3dtywNi) are a luxurious and comfortable pair of\nheadphones that take things to the max. If you can afford the $400 price tag,\nwe recommend them on all accounts.\n\n###  How we tested\n\nWe put each pair of on-ear headphones through a thorough battery of tests. We\nlooked into comfort over time, learned every control and companion app,\nlistened to various music genres, tested active noise cancellation where\navailable, put the batteries through their paces and catalogued warranties.\n\nCheck out the breakdown of our categories below.\n\n**Sound Quality**\n\n  * **Bass:** To test bass frequency, we listened to [\u201cBad Guy\u201d by Billie Eilish](https://amzn.to/2WzuIDs) and[ \u201cModern Jesus\u201d by Portugal. The Man](https://amzn.to/2yFDacf). The former features intense, booming bass that pushes headphones to their limits and the latter uses it more subtly, which is a better analogue for the average song. \n  * **Compression:** In music and audio, compression is used to balance sound by amplifying quiet sounds and reducing the volume of louder sounds. But too much can obscure higher-frequency tones and muffle deeper ones. We listened for the right amount of compression. If higher-frequency sounds became too shrill, or we heard audio artifacts, the compression was too low. If tones felt muted or bass was muddled or contained artifacts, there was too much. We listened to [\u201cBad Guy\u201d by Billie Eilish](https://amzn.to/2WzuIDs) to test super deep bass and [\u201cJazz Crimes\u201d by Joshua Redman](https://amzn.to/3dqsNrE) to test very high-frequency notes and quiet, subtle instruments.\n  * **Soundstage:** In music and audio, soundstage is that three-dimensional feeling brought on by high-quality stereo sound. When the soundstage is strong, you\u2019ll really be able to hear the positions of instruments and vocalists during a song. To test this, we primarily listened to[ \u201cI\u2019m on Fire\u201d by Bruce Springsteen](https://amzn.to/2WdRq52). This song features instrumentals with a strong 3D element to them, as well as vocals that resonate as if you\u2019re on stage or in the same room as the musicians.\n  * **Overall:** This subcategory combined our notes about bass, compression and soundstage. We also examined call quality here, noting voice crispness, background noise and issues such as poor compression. We listened to [\u201cLet Me In\u201d by Laminate Pet Animal](https://amzn.to/2xInEMi) and [\u201cModern Jesus\u201d by Portugal. The Man](https://amzn.to/2yFDacf), songs that make use of all three properties, to get a better idea of how the above subcategories worked together.\n\n**ANC (Active Noise Cancellation)**\n\n  * **Pure ANC:** We came up with two noisy conditions under which to try the ANC on headphones that include the feature: sitting near an active washing machine and listening to a soundtrack of a busy restaurant crowd from some loud speakers. These aimed to test how well headphones could mute and eliminate deep, bassy sounds as well as how well they reduced overall volume.\n  * **Levels of control:** We checked out how much control the user has over the level of ANC. Some devices simply allow you to toggle the feature on and off, while others give you the option to adjust the strength of ANC.\n\n**Design**\n\n  * **Build quality:** We looked at the quality of materials used to build each device, how the pieces fit together, and how the device looks. To test build quality, we fixed the headband as far as it would safely go and looked into what material composed the inner skeleton of each device. We also considered whether the ear cups fold inward and took a look at the quality of the buttons and how many were present. Finally, we accounted for each device\u2019s bulkiness and weight.\n  * **Ears cups:** We wore each pair for at least an hour at a time to determine whether the ear cups created any significant pressure. Ideally, we were searching for headphones so comfortable we forgot we were even wearing them.\n  * **Headband:** While wearing each pair, we noted headband flexibility and whether it applied uncomfortable pressure over time.\n  * **Overall comfort:** We took all of our comfort-related notes into account to determine where discomfort, if any, was coming from. For example, squeezing can occur where the ear cups and headband come together.\n\n**Features/Usability**\n\n  * **Controls on-device:** We learned and tested all the controls on each device to determine the intuitiveness of controls like playback, calls, volume, Bluetooth pairing and features like ANC toggling. We took note of whether there was a voice narrating the controls and/or providing information such as remaining battery.\n  * **Bluetooth connectivity:** We measured the latency of controls between each pair of headphones and the device we paired them to. We also measured how quickly each pair reconnected to a device to which it was previously paired, and the latency of playback controls. Finally, we checked whether they could pair with more than one device at a time.\n  * **Companion app:** We noted whether devices were supported by a companion app, and if so, the amount of control enabled by that app. For example, some apps provide complex options such as ANC strength adjustment, GPS headphone tracking and even custom sound profiles using an equalizer. Others simply display a device\u2019s battery life or let you toggle ANC on and off.\n  * **Ports:** We checked the ports to make sure they all functioned properly.\n  * **Controls off-device:** We combined the notes from the Bluetooth connectivity and companion app subcategories. We also checked whether the device could activate smart assistants. Finally, we noted whether a device included an AUX cable and if the cable came with a control box attached to it. If it did, we determined how much control this provided.\n\n**Battery**\n\n  * **Usage time:** We put together a playlist with a variety of genres including jazz, rock, pop, rap, classical and EDM, among others, to measure each device\u2019s battery life. Every pair of headphones was run through this playlist at 75% volume.\n  * **Quick charge:** This is a feature wherein a device can receive a large amount of battery life from a short charge. Among devices that support this feature, we tested which headphones gained the most battery from the shortest quick charge.\n  * **Overall:** We combined the notes from usage time and quick charge subcategories to determine the overall quality of a device\u2019s battery.\n\n**Warranty**\n\n  * **Warranty:** We determined what warranty/warranties each device came with. Longer or more numerous warranties scored better.\n\n###  How we rated\n\nEach device received a score for every subcategory. The combined scores of\neach subcategory comprised its respective category\u2019s maximum potential score.\nWe didn\u2019t place great emphasis on ANC, as many of the headphones we tested do\nnot support this feature. Check out our exact point breakdown below.\n\n  * **Sound quality** had a maximum of 40 points: bass (10 points), compression (5 points), soundstage (5 points) and overall (20 points).\n  * **Features/usability** had a maximum of 30 points: controls on-device (5 points), Bluetooth connectivity (5 points), companion app (5 points), ports (5 points) and controls off-device (10 points).\n  * **Design** had a maximum of 25 points: build quality (10 points), ear cups (5 points), headband (5 points) and overall comfort (5 points).\n  * **Battery** had a maximum of 20 points: usage time (10 points), quick charge (5 points) and overall (5 points)\n  * **ANC** had a maximum of 5 points: pure ANC (5 points) and levels of control (2 points).\n  * Warranty had a maximum of 5 points: Warranty (5 points)\n\nNotably, these points were assigned price-blind. We did not want a device\u2019s\ncost to bias our ratings. Once every point was assigned, we layered in price\nto determine the value that each headphones provided.\n\n###  Everything else we tested\n\n![](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200508123744-underscored-best-on-\near-headphones-everything-else-we-tested-live-video.jpg)\n\n**Beats Solo Pro ($299.95;**[ **amazon.com**](https://amzn.to/3fzOBmr) **)**\n\nThe [$299.95 Beats Solo Pros](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/cnn-\nunderscored/beats-solo-pro-review/index.html) were our pick for the best\nnoise-canceling headphones. (Read our full review here.) Of course, ANC isn\u2019t\nthe only area where these headphones came through: Their sound quality was\nterrific, and they received the same score as the Bowers & Wilkins PX5s.\nUltimately, they scored below the PX5s in bass performance, a subcategory we\ndeem pretty critical. Design-wise, the Solo Pros are a masterclass in\naesthetics, not to mention well built. However, they lost some points in\ncomfort, plus their ear cup button controls are very loud when pressed, which\ndetracted from our experience with them. So when we stripped away ANC as a\nprimary criterion for this guide, the Solo Pros didn\u2019t make the cut.\n\n**JLAB Studio ANC ($59.99;**[\n**bestbuy.com**](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/jlab-audio-studio-anc-wireless-\non-ear-headphones-black/6396199.p?skuId=6396199) **)**\n\nThe [$59.99 JLAB Studio ANCs](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/jlab-audio-studio-\nanc-wireless-on-ear-headphones-black/6396199.p?skuId=6396199) were\ndisappointing overall. They had a light, generally comfortable design, with\nunique wireframe ear cup arms. They also sport ANC, which, though not very\nstrong, is more than a number of headphones we tested in this lower price\nrange can boast. Even the battery is quite good at over 34 hours of playback\nwithout ANC on. The primary issue with these headphones was sound quality.\nThey served up a flat sound experience with inadequate bass.\n\n**Skullcandy Riff Wireless ($49.99;**[\n**amazon.com**](https://amzn.to/2SKhanl) **)**\n\nThe [$49.99 Skullcandy Riffs](https://amzn.to/2SKhanl) are a wildly affordable\npair of on-ear headphones. They really provide good bass, though we found the\nsound to be poorly compressed. They don\u2019t support ANC, the battery life is\njust 12 hours and they feel cheap in both build and comfort. However, we think\nthey provide decent value overall. This is made better by their easy control\nscheme and respectable quick charge. That being said, the sound clarity and\nbuild quality make these a questionable purchase.\n\n**Jabra Move Style Edition ($99.99;**[\n**amazon.com**](https://amzn.to/3bmAXQB) **)**\n\nThe [$99.99 Jabra Move Style Edition](https://amzn.to/3bmAXQB) scored the best\namong our budget options. They put out surprisingly clear sound, but suffer\ntremendously on bass performance. On top of that, they do not support ANC and\nhave a lackluster battery capacity of about 14 hours. Their build quality,\nhowever, is pretty high, with comfort that rivals more expensive devices \u2014\nthanks in part to weighing less than 5.5 ounces in total.\n\n**Urbanears Plattan 2 Bluetooth ($70;**[\n**urbanears.com**](https://www.urbanears.com/us/en/plattan-2-bluetooth.html)\n**)**\n\nThe [$70 Urbanears Plattan 2\nBluetooth](https://www.urbanears.com/us/en/plattan-2-bluetooth.html) weren\u2019t\nmuch better than the JLAB Studio ANCs. They share a very similar design, but\nwith lower build quality and comfort. And though they deliver pretty crisp\nsound, the bass is poor. These headphones do not feature ANC. On the upside,\nthey have over 30 hours of battery life, which is quite good. We also enjoyed\nthe controls, which took the form of a single joystick-like button: Pressing\nthe button toggled playback and calls, while moving it left, right, up and\ndown controlled volume and track skipping, respectively.\n\n_Note: The prices above reflect the retailer\u2019s listed prices at the time of\npublication._\n\n###### Get discounts and exclusive offers\n\nSign up for our
