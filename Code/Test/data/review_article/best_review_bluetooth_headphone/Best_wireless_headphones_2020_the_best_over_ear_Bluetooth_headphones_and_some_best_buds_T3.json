All the ways brands have come up with to get sound\ninto your ears. Ever since phones started losing their headphone sockets,\nwireless headphones and buds have taken a leap from being a niche, to the\nportable audio norm. Nowadays the best wireless headphones are more far sought\nafter than the [best wired headphones](https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-\nwired-headphones-and-wired-earbuds).\n\nAs consumers are demanding folk, Bluetooth audio sound quality has gone from\nfrankly rubbish to, often, pretty near to wired audio quality. Connectivity\nhas also greatly improved, so your music doesn't keep cutting out. It's the\ngolden age of wire cutting!\n\n  * [ _The best headphones for running_](https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-headphones-for-running) and workouts\n  * [Best wireless earbuds](https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-wireless-earbuds) \u2013 strictly in-ear Bluetooth ONLY\n  * When [Amazon Prime Day](https://www.t3.com/us/news/best-amazon-prime-day-deals-2020) finally happens, keep an eye out for Bluetooth bargains\n\n## What are the best Bluetooth headphones and earbuds?\n\nLots of quality choices here, before you even get on to the noise-cancelling\nand true wireless options below\u2026\n\nIf you favour the larger headphone, the best over-ears are Audio-Technica's\nATH-M50XBT, which have a fairly neutral (but nicely bassy) tone. If you prefer\na more rockin' sound, Marshall Monitor are excellent. Best on-ears are AKG's\nY50BT.\n\nFor in-ears, I recommend either the Optoma Nuforce Be Live5, which is great\nvalue for money, or the pricier Sennheiser Momentum Free.\n\nIf you like the 'necklace' style of headphone, try SoundMagic's excellent\nE11BT \u2013 an incredible bargain. Though for more bargains keep an eye on our\n[Amazon Prime Day](https://www.t3.com/us/news/best-amazon-prime-day-\ndeals-2020) page.\n\nThe only good example of a wireless in-ear monitor I've come across is Flare's\nextraordinary [Flares Pro\n2HD](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8434&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FFlare-\nAudio%25C2%25AE-Wireless-Ear-Earphones%2Fdp%2FB07K8PHS58%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-21%26ascsubtag%3Dt3-us-3566153817622888400-21) \u2013 an in-ear monitor that\ncan either connect via a cable or via an included, small Bluetooth DAC.\n\n## The finest noise cancelling cans (also wireless of course, but not included\nin this Top 10)\n\nWe've got an entire list dedicated to ANC cans. They tend to be more\nexpensive, but that certainly doesn't put people off buying them.\n\nMy favourite is, by a narrow margin, the **Sony WH-1000XM3** , which has\npossibly the best noise cancelling of the lot, and also the most musically\nrewarding audio. However, rivals such as Bowers & Wilkins PX7, or the\nexcellent call quality of Bose's NC 700 and Beats by Dr Dre Studio 3 Wireless\nall run it close.\n\n\u2022 Take a more in-depth look at the [**best noise cancelling\nheadphones**](https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-noise-cancelling-headphones)\n\nToday's best prices on the best noise cancelling headphones\n\n[15 Amazon customer\nreviews](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Freviews%2FB077QLXCYJ%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26ascsubtag%3Dt3-us-1453650447089314300-20)\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nReduced Price\n\nBowers & Wilkins PX Active...\n\nAmazon\n\n[$399.99](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8434&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07574TYWW%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dt3-us-1280353771609772500-20)\n\n[$219](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8434&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07574TYWW%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dt3-us-1280353771609772500-20)\n\n[View](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8434&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07574TYWW%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dt3-us-1280353771609772500-20)\n\nReduced Price\n\nBowers & Wilkins PX Active...\n\nWalmart\n\n[$500.49](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=651226586&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F651226586&subId1=t3-us-8668682298010617000)\n\n[$307.66](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=651226586&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F651226586&subId1=t3-us-1594555658645969700)\n\n[View](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=651226586&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F651226586&subId1=t3-us-7223801446008873000)\n\nBowers & Wilkins PX Active...\n\nWalmart\n\n[$358.25](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=260316565&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F260316565&subId1=t3-us-3404657679803626500)\n\n[View](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&prodsku=260316565&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F260316565&subId1=t3-us-7264932829384581000)\n\nBowers & Wilkins (B&W) Noise...\n\nAmazon\n\n[$457.20](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8434&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB077QLXCYJ%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dt3-us-1030330654046822000-20)\n\n[View](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8434&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB077QLXCYJ%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dt3-us-1030330654046822000-20)\n\nShow More Deals\n\nWe check over 130 million products every day for the best prices\n\n## The best true wireless headphones (also Bluetooth)\n\nAlso known as 'Apple AirPods and Apple AirPod rivals', true wireless are in-\near buds with _no wires whatsoever_ , whereas traditional Bluetooth buds are\njoined by a single wire, with a remote control and battery/charging port\nmounted along its length.\n\nAgain, these have their own best buys chart for you to peruse, because they\nare quite a different proposition to 'traditional' wireless headphones.

Apple iOS\nproducts support AAC and most Android mobile devices support Qualcomm's aptX.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is this, readers. Do you use an iPhone or\niPad for music? Then aptX is _useless_ to you, no matter how big the logo is\non the headphones box. You need AAC compatibility. Mystifyingly, despite many\niPhone owners being music fans with lots of disposable income, an awful lot of\nquite premium audio brands seem to have absolutely no idea what AAC even is.\n\nIf you have an Android phone, most likely it supports aptX, so dive right in.\nThere's also aptX HD, which claims to offer better than CD quality sound but\nis not very widely supported as yet. And aptX Low Latency, which is for\nwatching films wirelessly (Bluetooth can otherwise introduce lag that makes\nfor lip-synch issues akin to watching a 1970s, dubbed kung-fu movie).\n\nAlthough they won't usually support it out of the box, you _can_ force both\nWindows and Apple laptops to support aptX. I have no idea why this is as\nunnecessarily hard as it is, but there we go. Trust me, it _can_ be done.\n\nApple laptops can also be made to support AAC, although again this is way less\nstraightforward than you'd expect. You need to pretend to be a developer and\ndownload the Bluetooth Explorer app from Apple's dev site (or cheat and get it\nfrom 'elsewhere on the web'.)\n\nIn general, on most headphones, audio sent via either aptX or AAC sounds\nbetter than when sent without.\n\nIt's not totally cut and dried: I've heard certain headphones (and Bluetooth\nspeakers) that just use the standard SBC Bluetooth format, that sound better\nthan certain other ones with AptX and AAC. They're not a magic formula for\ngreat audio on their own, but on average, headphones with support for AAC and\naptX tend to sound better when paired with a device that also does.\n\nAlthough aptX and AAC offer sound quality roughly the same as CD, obviously\nthat only applies if your source is putting out CD quality (or better) audio\nin the first place.\n\n**\u2022 Bluetooth headphones: what else do you need to know?**\n\nBluetooth cans today are generally far more stable in terms of connection than\nthey were just a few years ago, and battery life has improved, too. As well as\na norm of 4-5 hours for true wireless, 8-10 hours for in-ear buds and easily\n20+ on over-ears and on-ears, a lot of newer headphones also charge rapidly,\ngiving you several hours of playback for 15-30 minutes of charge.\n\nIf you keep your phone in your hip pocket, and especially if you then contort\nyour body by looking around you, you may find the signal still cuts out as\nyour bones and guts are very adept at blocking radio signals.\n\nHowever, from your hand, a breast pocket, placed on a desk or in one of those\nweird arm holster things for runners, you should rarely get any interference\nfrom these headphones. You can usually walk between 20-30 metres away from\nwherever the sound is coming from, although you generally can't leave the\nbuilding and expect to still receive audio. Why would you do that anyway?\n\nI recommend paying a bit more \u2013 \u00a3100/$100 to \u00a3300/$300 \u2013 to get the kind of\nover-ear, wireless headphones that'll give pleasure for years. However,\nparticularly if you prefer in-ears, you can get very solid Bluetooth\nheadphones for WAY less.\n\n## The best Bluetooth headphones (not true wireless, not noise cancellers) in\norder\n\n![Best Bluetooth headphones: Audio-Technica\nATH-M50XBT](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-\nimage.svg)![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 1\\.

That's because outdoors is where Bluetooth comes into its own \u2013\nat home, you might want to chill out with a pair of superior, [wired over-ear\nheadphones](https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-wired-headphones-and-wired-\nearbuds).\n\nHowever this Bluetooth version of the classic Audio-Technica ATH-M50 retains a\nmore 'hi-fi' sound, designed for long-term listening indoors, but also\nexcellent when used outdoors and while travelling. In terms of quality,\nthey're more like very premium, noise-cancelling, wireless headphones such as\nthose from Bose, Bowers & Wilkins and Sony.\n\nThey can be a bit funny to pair and very occasionally lose connection when\nyou're out and about, but it's easy to forgive those technological foibles\nbecause the ATH-M50xBT sounds so damn good. I don't think they're excessively\n'audiophile' in tone either \u2013 the bass is definitely hyped a bit, and the\nresult is very pleasing. They can be subtle and quiet, but they can also rock\nthe house.\n\nAnother bonus is that the battery lasts for 40 hours \u2013 almost long enough for\na Pink Floyd box set. They're also comfortable enough for that kind of\nduration, although your ears may get a tad warm during summer listening\nsessions. The build quality maybe doesn't suggest decades of use to come, but\nit's not overtly flimsy either.\n\nHaving had time to get to know these over-ears, I've come to conclude that\nthey're the best non-noise-cancelling, Bluetooth headphones you can currently\nbuy\u2026\n\n![Best Bluetooth headphones: AKG\nY50BT](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 2\\.

AKG's wireless headphone version of its\ncelebrated Y50 was ahead of its time in terms of the reliability of its\nBluetooth connection, and they really nailed the sound as well. They're quite\nbassy enough, but don't push the bottom end to the detriment of the mids and\ntreble.\n\nLightweight and attractive, they do pinch on your specs a bit if you're a\nglasses wearer but that unfortunate trait is common to practically all on-ear\n(as opposed to over-ear) headphones.\n\nDue to their age, the Y50BT can be had for a much more reasonable price, these\ndays.

But you would\nbe incorrect in that assumption.\n\nThat's because not only do the BE Sport4 have all the usual virtues of the\n[best running headphones](https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-headphones-for-\nrunning) \u2013 water and sweat resistance, a secure but comfortable fit, not too\npricey \u2013 they're also sound easily good enough to use outside of workout\nduties.\n\nThey're very musical with well-weighted bass and excellent noise isolation\nbecause of the secure fit. Audio quality is further helped by support for both\nAptX (for Android) and AAC (for iOS).\n\nThe battery life of 10 hours obviously can't compare with the big over-ear\ncans in this list, but it's not bad at all. Connectivity is also very solid,\nalthough they do have one major quirk: they take about 10 seconds to connect\nto your phone. That's really their only major flaw, and pretty forgivable\ngiven the price. I've been using these for over a year now, and keep coming\nback to them despite having vastly more costly headphones at my disposal.\n\nAlthough they take a little longer to pair and perhaps sound slightly less\nexcellent than the Sport4, the older Optoma BE Sport3 are still worth\nconsidering, because they can often be found going very cheap indeed.\n\n![Best wireless earbuds: SoundMagic\nE11BT](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 4\\.

However, they're not as bad as Beats' older\nheadphones in those respects and to my ears, I must admit that they generally\nsound fantastic. They're near perfect headphones for rock, hip-hop and\nelectronica, but that is not to say that they render anything more delicate\nthan Slayer unlistenable.\n\nThe Monitor Bluetooth sits at the top of the Marshall range, although\ndiscounting means it can ofter be had for around \u00a3150 (RRP is over \u00a3200). They\nare attractive, sound great, and are more comfortable than the cheaper\nMarshall headphones, although glasses wearers may still find they become a bit\ntesting after prolonged use.

Well, no longer!\n\nFlares Pro might look like they've been knocked up in a shed by a keen amateur\nelectrician, but they're comfortably the best Bluetooth headphones I've heard.\nThat's especially true with Apt-X compatible players and hi-res files, but\neven when used to listen to MP3 from an iPhone, audio is a revelation.\n\nThat's because the comfortable, minimalist buds are actually attached to an\nexternal wireless DAC. This does a fantastic job of wringing the most out of\nyour digital music. However, for reasons known only to Flare, the cord it's on\nis so short that you have to clip it to your lapel, like a policeman's walkie-\ntalkie.\n\nIf you can put up with that sartorial no-no, I wholeheartedly recommend the\nFlares Pro.\n\nAdmittedly, they are also a touch expensive compared to most in-ear Bluetooth\nheadphones, but the size of the sound stage, plus the impeccable clarity and\nquality of the audio more than justifies what you pay. The only thing I can\nreally think of to compare it to is Ifi's superb xDSD Bluetooth portable DAC,\nplugged into a pair of decent IEMs \u2013 and that will set you back the best part\nof 600 quid, in all.\n\nThe Flares Pro serve up real stereo rather than the channel-blurring mush of\nmost wireless cans, and bass is taut and engaging without overwhelming the\nmiddle and upper registers. From electronic dance music to delicate classical,\neverything sounds like what you'd expect from comparably priced, wired\nheadphones. For Bluetooth, it's mind blowing. Connectivity seems rock solid,\ntoo.\n\nCuriously, you can also disconnect the buds from the Bluetooth DAC and plug\nthe ends into a supplied cable running to a 3.5mm jack, and use them as wired\nheadphones. From a phone, they actually sound worse in this form, but use a\nmusic player or [headphone DAC](https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-dac) and\nresults again veer back toward mind-blowing.\n\nOther than the odd design, my only reservation with these is that even with\nthe choice of approximately 9 billion silicone and memory foam tips provided,\nit's hard to make them stay in place during a run or cycle. So, I guess, don't\nwear them while running or cycling would be my advice [(use some of these\ninstead)](https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-headphones-for-running) \u2013 the\nFlares Pros are headphones to be savoured at leisure, anyway.\n\nOne significant minus point for some will be the absence of AAC compatibility,\nfor getting the best possible Bluetooth sound out of an iOS device. When\nyou're trying so hard to make an 'audiophile' wireless product, it almost\nbeggars belief that you'd leave it out, from a marketing perspective, though I\ncan confirm the Flares Pro still sounds excellent when using an iPhone. The\npresence of aptX means it tends to sound even better from compatible Android\ndevices, though.\n\nThese are now at an excellent price, in my opinion, having been heavily\ndiscounted since launch.

Get in!\n\nThe results are all you'd expect from Sennheiser, with boring yet _slightly\nodd_ styling being outweighed by excellent sonics and decent attention to\ntechnical detail. Audio is as good as you'll find on wired headphones of\nsimilar price and if the battery life of six hours isn't exceptional, the\nhighly reliable connectivity and inclusion of Bluetooth 4.2, AAC and Apt-X\nmake that easier to live with.\n\nWith rock, pop hip-hop and electronic music, Sennheiser's 'signature Momentum\nsound' is relentlessly involving, punchy and listenable. It's hardly the most\ntransparent or neutral of performances but so what? Unlike some pop-oriented\ncans it does make a very decent fist of rendering acoustic sounds and the\nhuman voice.\n\nThe design is a _bit_ odd, as usually seem to be the case with Sennheiser\nthese days. The cable is way longer than it needs to be, and the battery and\nremote give it a bit more weight than you'd expect, given the battery life is\nonly six hours.

For that reason, there's no analogue, wired option but you can\nattach to compatible equipment \u2013 laptops, for instance \u2013 with a USB-C cable.\nWhat's the sound like? Not surprisingly, it sounds very 'digital'; accurate,\nrhythmically sure-footed and able to go very loud, but maybe a bit on the cold\nside, for me.\n\nThey're good looking and reassuringly expensive-feeling cans, although the\nvolume and pause/play controls are as bad as any I've ever encountered.

Actually, Nurafone sound great\nwith all sorts of music but the amount of bass available definitely makes them\nmost suited to those who like to 'have it large' whilst 'getting on one'.\n\nAs you probably know if you have used Facebook or been to any website that has\nadverts on it in the past year, Nuraphone claims to adapt to your hearing, to\ngive 'magical' results that will make you weep tears of joy. Yeesh. Do me a\nfavour.\n\nIt's impossible to prove or disprove the validity of Nuraphone's claims.\nAlthough I can say with some certainty that with the adaptive setting turned\noff, they sound like crap. With it turned on, I did not weep tears of joy, but\nI found them highly enjoyable to listen to.\n\nThis was especially true, I found, with early 90s jungle, deep and glitchy\nelectronica from the likes of Autechre, 70s reggae, and dance-influenced rock\nfrom the likes of The Clash and LCD Soundsystem.\n\nEssentially I came to try Nuraphone with a great deal of cynicism, but they do\nsound good. Also, despite looking like something from an HR Giger sketch \u2013\nwith their bizarre, combined in-ear/over-ear design, they both smother and\npenetrate \u2013 they're not uncomfortable by any means.\n\nOn the other hand, they do cost quite a lot, and the 'Immersion' setting,\nwhich makes the headphones vibrate when turned right up, is preposterous.\nStill, good to see someone doing something different in the headphones field.\n\n![Best Bluetooth headphones: Marshall Mid\nBluetooth](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 10\\.

It's done it better, at least to my ears.\n\nThis pair takes the rockin' sound of the Major II Wireless and adds better\naudio \u2013 Apt-X is supported this time \u2013 better padding on the ear cups, and\nnotably less ropey build quality. It also tones down the novelty of the\ndesign, although the faux leather look is still clearly not going to appeal to\neveryone.\n\nWhat makes the Mid such a winner \u2013 for me, at any rate; I know these things\nare subjective \u2013 is that the audio is bloody great\u2026 if you play it loud like a\nmother. WOAH YEAAH!\n\nThe Mid has power, but it also has a decent dollop of precision. There's\nplenty of bass, but not to an obnoxious degree. With rock, anything electronic\nand hip-hop/R&B, it does a cracking job. Same with pop and heavier classical.\n\nI wouldn't buy a Mid to listen solely to light jazz \u2013 or anything quiet in\nfact. However, unlike the Major II, the Mid does at least make a half decent\nfist of playing more subtle sounds.\n\nThe battery life is a little shorter than the Major II, presumably due to\nlarger drivers and introducing the Apt-X connection\u2026 But it's still 20+ hours,\nso hardly to be sniffed at.\n\nThe one criticism I have is that they are on the tight side, to the extent\nthat wearing them with glasses verges on painful. Presumably they will loosen\nover time, but people who wear specs (or have large heads) should look\nelsewhere.\n\nThere is also now a version of the Mid with active noise cancelling. It is\ncalled, logically enough, Marshall Mid ANC. It sounds exactly as good as the\nstandard Mid, and while the noise cancelling is not on par with the likes of\nBose, Sony and Bowers & Wilkins, it does shut out enough extra ambient sound\nto make the listening experience even more enjoyable.\n\n![Best wireless earbuds: Optoma NuForce Be\nLive5](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/t3/missing-image.svg)\n\n  \n\n### 11\\.
