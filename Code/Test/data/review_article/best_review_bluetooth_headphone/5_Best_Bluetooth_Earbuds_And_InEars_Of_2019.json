Unlike most websites, we do not get our\nproducts directly from the manufacturers, which means our units aren\u2019t\nhandpicked and actually represent what you would buy yourself. We spend a lot\nof time comparing the products side-by-side to validate our results and we\nkeep them until they are discontinued so we can continually go back and make\nsure our reviews are always accurate._\n\nBluetooth earbuds have significantly advanced in recent years. They sound\nbetter, last longer and are more portable than ever before. From truly\nwireless earbuds to around-the-neck in-ears, the market is getting more and\nmore crowded, but they aren\u2019t all created equally. For example, in-ears are\ncompact, but not everyone will find them comfortable, especially for longer\nlistening sessions. Earbuds aren\u2019t as compact but are generally more\ncomfortable over long periods of time.\n\nTo sort through the noise, we\u2019ve tested 64 wireless in-ears and earbuds. Here\nare our top 5 recommendations.\n\n* * *\n\n[\n](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=zmNbNw6aNM4&mid=38606&u1=rtingsearphones&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fjaybird-\ntarah-pro-wireless-in-ear-headphones-black-\nflash%2F6289924.p%3FskuId%3D6289924%26intl%3Dnosplash)\n\nJaybird Tarah Pro\n\nRTINGS.com\n\n## Jaybird Tarah Pro: Great Sports Headphones With An Impressive EQ\n\n#### **Type:** In-ear | **Enclosure:** Closed-back | **Wireless:** Yes |\n**Noise Cancelling:** No\n\n**[SHOP\nNOW](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=zmNbNw6aNM4&mid=38606&u1=rtingsearphones&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fjaybird-\ntarah-pro-wireless-in-ear-headphones-black-\nflash%2F6289924.p%3FskuId%3D6289924%26intl%3Dnosplash)**\n\nThe best wireless in-ear headphones we\u2019ve reviewed so far are the Jaybird\nTarah Pro. They\u2019re well-built, easy-to-use in-ears that have a fairly\ncomfortable earbud-like fit. They have a very stable fit and are rated IPX7\nfor superior water resistance, which makes them a great option for sports.\n\nOut-of-the-box, the Jaybird Tarah Pro have very good audio reproduction and\nare well-suited for a wide range of music genres. If you like to be able to\nhave various sound profiles for different purposes, the Jaybird MySound app\nlets you do just that. It features a great parametric EQ so you can customize\nthe sound to your liking and save your choices. The Tarah Pro also have a very\ngood battery. They last for slightly over 13 hours and they have magnetic\nearbuds that can snap together to trigger an auto-off timer.\n\nUnfortunately, the Tarah Pro, like most Jaybird headphones, have a proprietary\ncharging cradle. This can be inconvenient if you forget the charging cradle at\nhome since you can\u2019t use a regular micro-USB cable to charge them. All things\nconsidered though, the Jabra Tarah Pro are well-rounded, versatile headphones\nthat are especially great for sports and fitness.\n\n* * *\n\n[\n](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HETFQA8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=rtings-\nearphonesupdate-20&linkId=837aa8879a810c328edb45f847c13a28&language=en_US)\n\nBose QuietControl 30\n\nRTINGS.com\n\n## Bose QuietControl 30: Versatile And Comfortable Earbuds With Great\nIsolation\n\n#### **Type:** Earbuds | **Enclosure:** Closed-back | **Wireless:** Yes |\n**Noise Cancelling:** Yes\n\n**[SHOP\nNOW](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HETFQA8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=rtings-\nearphonesupdate-20&linkId=837aa8879a810c328edb45f847c13a28&language=en_US)**\n\nThe Bose QuietControl 30 are versatile noise-canceling wireless headphones\nwith a comfortable earbud fit. Most in-ears protrude deeply into the ear canal\nand cause discomfort over time, but the Bose QC 30 fit snugly in the ear canal\nwithout entering too far, so they\u2019re more comfortable over time.\n\nThey have very good noise cancellation, which is great for commuters and those\nwho travel a lot. They also have a fairly balanced sound with a lot of bass,\nwhich is nice if you like to listen to hip-hop or pop. Their wireless range is\ndecent, and they have a good 11-hour battery life with an auto-off feature\nthat saves a lot of power and can be adjusted via the Bose Connect app.\n\nUnfortunately, the rubber sleeve that covers the neckband tends to come off\nwith time. This issue is mostly cosmetic but is definitely disappointing for\npremium earbuds at this price point. Their app also doesn\u2019t have an EQ.\nOtherwise, the Bose QuietControl 30 are versatile, comfortable earbuds that\nare a great choice for commuters.\n\n* * *\n\n[\n](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BHF993Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=rtings-\nearphonesupdate-20&linkId=6088f023754932b2b48acd072ee86efe&language=en_US)\n\nJabra Elite Active 65t\n\nRTINGS.com\n\n## Jabra Elite Active 65t: Versatile Truly Wireless In-ears\n\n#### **Type:** In-ear | **Enclosure:** Closed-back | **Wireless:** Truly\nWireless | **Noise Cancelling:** No\n\n**[SHOP\nNOW](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BHF993Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=rtings-\nearphonesupdate-20&linkId=6088f023754932b2b48acd072ee86efe&language=en_US)**\n\nIf you want something a bit more portable than the Bose QuietControl 30, then\nget the Jabra Elite Active 65t. They have a compact truly wireless design and\na good charging case that will easily fit in your pockets. They\u2019re very well-\nbuilt and are great for sports thanks to their stable fit and IP56 rating for\ndust and water resistance.\n\nThe Elite Active 65t sound decent and their battery lasts for 5 hours of\ncontinuous playtime. Though you won\u2019t be able to use them for more than 5\nhours at a time, their charging case provides 2 additional charges, which\nmeans they should last you the whole day if you place them in their charging\ncase while they\u2019re not in use. They support Bluetooth 5.0 and can pair to 2\ndevices simultaneously.\n\nUnfortunately, the 65t\u2019s earbuds are a bit bulkier than typical in-ears, so\nthey won\u2019t be the most comfortable headphones for everyone. They also sound a\nbit sharp on S and T sounds, but you can EQ their sound profile, unlike the\nBose, thanks to the customizable Jabra Sound+ app.\n\n* * *\n\n[\n](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0721MP41Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=rtings-\nearphonesupdate-20&linkId=5ed095329267ec8cfb9387198d9fffc0&language=en_US)\n\nAnker SoundBuds Curve\n\nRTINGS.com\n\n## Anker SoundBuds Curve: Decent Sounding Budget Sports Headphones\n\n#### **Type:** In-ear | **Enclosure:** Closed-back | **Wireless:** Yes |\n**Noise Cancelling:** No\n\n**[SHOP\nNOW](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0721MP41Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=rtings-\nearphonesupdate-20&linkId=5ed095329267ec8cfb9387198d9fffc0&language=en_US)**\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for well-rounded wireless earbuds at a low price, get the\nAnker SoundBuds Curve. They have a surprisingly comfortable fit with stable\near-hooks that prevent them from falling off your ears, even during intense\nexercise.\n\nThe Anker SoundBuds Curve fully charge in an hour and a half and their battery\nlasts for nearly 13 hours of continuous playback, which should be long enough\nto last you a full day of use. They pack a lot of bass, which makes them a\ngood choice to use if you like listening to EDM, dubstep, rap, or hip-hop.\n\nAlthough they look fairly well-made for budget headphones, they don\u2019t feel\nvery durable or sweatproof. They\u2019re also not the ideal headphones for more\ncritical listeners, but they sound better than most wireless in-ears in their\nprice range and their deep bass will help get you pumped at the gym. That\nsaid, if you want the best bang for your buck, then it\u2019s hard to beat the\nAnker SoundBuds Curve.\n\n* * *\n\n[\n](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01L7PSJFO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=rtings-\nearphonesupdate-20&linkId=53e824db3fbe31efe3aac440a11a57f3&language=en_US)\n\nBose SoundSport Wireless\n\nRTINGS.com\n\n## Bose SoundSport Wireless: Comfortable Wireless Earbuds With Above-Average\nSound\n\n#### **Type:** Earbuds | **Enclosure:** Semi-open | **Wireless:** Yes |\n**Noise Cancelling:** No\n\n**[SHOP\nNOW](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01L7PSJFO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=rtings-\nearphonesupdate-20&linkId=53e824db3fbe31efe3aac440a11a57f3&language=en_US)**\n\nIf you like the earbud fit of the Bose QuietControl 30 and don't require noise\ncancellation, then get the Bose SoundSport Wireless. They\u2019re a lot cheaper\nthan the QC 30 but are just as comfortable. They're fairly well-built, with a\nthick audio cable that links the two dense and durable earbuds and are good\nchoice for sports enthusiasts who care about sound quality.\n\nThe Bose SoundSport Wireless sound very good for wireless earbuds. They have a\nwell-balanced sound that caters well to all music genres, from hip-hop to\nclassical. They last just about 6 hours on a charge so you may need to charge\nthem in the middle of the day, but they have an auto-off timer to save power\nwhen not in use. They have a great wireless range and also support NFC for\neasy pairing with certain mobile devices.\n\nThe SoundSport Wireless have a thick rubber coating that seems to provide some\nwater resistance, but they\u2019re not as sweatproof as some of the other wireless\nin-ears and earbuds we've tested. They\u2019re also not ideal for loud\nenvironments, unlike the QC 30 which are better-suited for noisy commutes or\nlong flights. That said, if you\u2019re an outdoors runner looking to remain aware\nof your surroundings while still enjoying your favorite tunes, the Bose\nSoundSport Wireless are worth considering.\n\n_This guide may have been updated.
