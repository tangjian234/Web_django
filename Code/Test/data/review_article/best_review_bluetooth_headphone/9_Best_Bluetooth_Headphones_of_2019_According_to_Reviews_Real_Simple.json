That's why we handpicked the most healthy\nfoods that are delicious and incredibly easy to cook with. After all, rule\nnumber one for sticking to a smart meal plan is to not get bored, and these\nhealthy ingredients will keep you on your toes (promise!). You'll notice\nsomething that all these healthy foods to eat have in common: each one is a\nbasic ingredient, such as a grain, fruit, vegetable, or dairy product. Read:\nno pre-packaged products with a laundry list of strange-sounding ingredients\nin sight. You can use this as a rule of thumb when shopping: if the food is\nsimple, wholesome, plant-based, and/or comes from the periphery of the grocery\nstore\u2014i.e., where the produce, eggs, fish, and other whole foods tend to\nlive\u2014you're in good shape.
