After poring over\nreviews from consumers and reading the thoughts of other industry experts, I\nset out on extensive personal testing.\n\nI spent at least a week with every pick on this list, using the earbuds daily\non my commute, at work, and even while exercising. I evaluated the earbuds on\nthe following criteria:\n\n  * Ergonomics and how they feel in the ear\n  * Audio performance and overall sound quality\n  * Fit during various activities\n  * Battery life \n\nWe all know that sound is one of the most important factors when shopping for\nwireless earbuds. To test the earbuds' sound capabilities, I listened to [my\nfavorite\nplaylists](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZtZ8vUCzche?si=lwHJV8t1TUWzeNaRGtXl9g)\n\u2014 along with a few podcasts \u2014 and paid close attention to their audible\nfrequency range. The term relates to the headset's ability to deliver the\ntreble (highs), the midrange, and the bass in your favorite tracks.\n\nThe treble and the midrange performance sets the best wireless earbuds apart\nfrom their rivals. It will help you enjoy the vocals, as well as the finer\ndetails in a song's instrumental accompaniment to the fullest. Bass is\ntypically the easiest audio bit to reproduce. But, especially in affordably\npriced headsets, it might come at the expense of the mids and the highs.\n\nI also made and took calls using each headset in order to evaluate the quality\nof its audio, as well as the performance of its built-in microphone(s).\n\nOur Testing Process\n\n[ ![](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/how-we-\ntested-1586186764.gif?crop=1xw:0.8887876025524157xh;center,top&resize=300:*)\nHow We Test Products ](/lifestyle/a29196296/how-we-test-products/)\n\nNow that you know what to look for in a pair of wireless earbuds, check out\nour reviews of the best options on the market today, and get ready to begin a\nnew sound journey without wires.\n\n## Best Overall\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ?linkCode=ogi)\n\nJabra Elite 75t Wireless Earbuds\n\nJabra amazon.com\n\n$179.99\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ?linkCode=ogi)\n\nThe all-new Jabra Elite 75t earbuds are better in every way than their\n[already excellent\npredecessors](https://www.bestproducts.com/tech/gadgets/a28323955/jabra-\nelite-65t-truly-wireless-earbuds-review/) \u2014 which just happened to be our\nlongtime top pick in the ballooning wireless earbud field. They're more\nelegant, comfier, and more entertaining sound-wise. They last longer between\nbattery charges, too.\n\nThe Elite 75t deliver a powerful bass, which you can adjust via Jabra\u2019s mobile\napp. Thanks to four built-in microphones, phone calls sound amazing, too.\nFinally, the buds last up to 7.5 hours between charges; their battery case\nholds a few additional charges, for a total of 28 hours of wireless freedom.\n\nAll in all, these buds have everything you'd want in wireless earbuds.\n\nRelated Story\n\n[ ![](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jabra-\nelite-75t-earbuds-1576184177.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*)\nReviewed: Jabra Elite 75t Wireless Earbuds ](/tech/gadgets/a30199338/jabra-\nelite-75t-wireless-earbuds-review/)\n\n## Runner-Up\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E8BDS60?linkCode=ogi)\n\nSoundcore Liberty 2 Pro Wireless Earbuds\n\nSoundcore amazon.com\n\n$149.99\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E8BDS60?linkCode=ogi)\n\nThe Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro truly wireless earbuds are Anker\u2019s most exciting\naudio product to date and a worthy alternative to our top pick from Jabra (we\ndo, however, think the Jabras are more comfortable and durable).\n\nThe buds have an impressive sound, which can be tailor-made to your hearing\nvia a feature called HearID. It's easy to set up in the mobile app and it sets\nthe buds apart from all competitors in their price range.\n\nYou'll get up to 8 hours of battery life from the buds, and the charging case\nholds three additional full charges.

Thankfully, there are two additional EQ presets (for\nmovies and podcasts) in case you find the lows too powerful.\n\nSkullcandy offers the Indy Fuel in black or grey.

I like\nthat RHA has equipped the product with a USB-C connector for charging.
