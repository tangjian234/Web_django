* [ Gadgets ](/gadgets-products/)\n  * [ Headphones ](/headphones/)\n  * [ Beats ](/beats-by-dre/)\n\nIn the search for the best wireless headphones, you quickly encounter three\nlevels of 'purity'.\n\nFirst, there are \u2018true wireless\u2019 headphones, which are basically two ear plugs\nthat have no wires whatsoever. The most recognisable example are the Apple\nAirPods \u2013 small white buds that slot into your ear and leave little trace on\nyour silhouette. They're as pure as can be.\n\nThen there are headphones that share a wire, running around the back of your\nneck or over your head, that links right ear to left. These will connect\nwirelessly to your smartphone or speaker, normally over Bluetooth. They're\noften liked by sporty types, because the wire keeps them held together.\n\nAnd finally there are 'hybrid' headphones, which can connect over Bluetooth,\nbut also come with a standard headphone cable. These are almost always over-\near headphones, and they make up a large proportion of the market.\n\nAll three types are technically wireless headphones, and you\u2019ll find examples\nof all three varieties in this guide. They come with their own pros and cons \u2013\nfor example, true wireless headphones are almost faff-free but need frequent\ncharging; while hybrid headphones offer you the most dexterity \u2013 so it\u2019s\nreally a case of you deciding which design meets your needs.\n\nThere\u2019s basically no real difference between the sound quality, so it\u2019s really\njust about which design you find most comfortable and which suits your\naesthetic.\n\nWhile I had no real problems with the wireless qualities of the headphones I\nreviewed, I\u2019m prepared to admit that I\u2019m not the most musically-inclined\nperson, so I sought the advice of musician and West End sound technician [Karl\nToth](https://www.karltoth.co.uk/), who tested each pair of headphones and\ntalked me through their individual audio merits and demerits.\n\nHere\u2019s what we found when looking for the best wireless headphones on the\nmarket, starting with our absolute favourite\u2026\n\n### **1\\. Creative Super X-Fi Air**\n\n**Why we like them:** They make your music sound like you\u2019re in the room with\nthe band\n\n[\u00a3149.99, Creative](https://uk.creative.com/p/super-x-fi/creative-sxfi-air)\n\n![Creative Super X-Fi Air best wireless\nheadphones](/content/dam/recommended/2019/03/25/Creative-Super-X-Fi-Air_Best-\nwireless-\nheadphones_recommended_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?imwidth=480)\n\nWhile you may not have heard of Creative Technology, you will almost have\ncertainly used one of their products. The Singapore-based company are arguably\none of the most influential tech companies in the world today. Their original\nsound card is the reason we have computer speakers to this day.\n\nThe Super X-Fi Air headphones were the toast of this year\u2019s Consumer\nElectronics Show, where critics called them \u201cmind-blowing\u201d and described using\nthem as an \u201ceargasm\u201d. Quite the reputation to live up to.\n\nInitially, both Toth and I were decidedly unimpressed. The padding on the cups\nfeels cheap, and the customisable light-up rings on the cups feels rather like\na distracting gimmick than a luxury feature. More alarmingly, the sound was\nhit-and-miss: Toth described the high end of the sound spectrum being \u201cpushed\nto the limits of still being listenable\u201d.\n\nAnd then we pushed a button and the world moved beneath our feet. You see,\nwe'd been using the Super X-Fi Air wrongly. There's an accompanying app that\nhas a function that moulds the sound to your ears. How? You use your phone or\ntablet to take a picture of each of your ears, then your head, and Creative\u2019s\nalgorithm uses the shapes of each to test your hearing and adapt the\nheadphones to you. (I\u2019m told this is the most efficient way of doing so,\nwithout spending a tonne of time and money to get your ears tested in a\nprofessional environment.)\n\nImmediately the whole listening experience changed, says Toth. \u201cIt feels like\nit went from listening to someone in the next room to the wall coming down.\nThey\u2019re incredible, they make me feel giddy like a child.\u201d\n\nThe same goes if you take a phone call on them. It honestly makes the person\non the other end of the line sound like they are speaking to you in the same\nroom. The sound fidelity is so phenomenally good, I stopped caring about that\ncheap padding completely.\n\nThere\u2019s a number of other nice features too like touch controls on the cups,\nso you can tap to play and pause your music, or swipe to adjust the volume or\nskip through tracks. And you can insert a microSD card to be able to listen to\nmusic without having to connect to your phone via Bluetooth.\n\nFinally, I have to commend the equitability of Creative. For those who\u2019d like\nthe benefits of hyper-personalised music but already have a pair of\nheadphones, it might be worth seeking out the [Super X-Fi\nAmp](https://uk.creative.com/p/super-x-fi/creative-sxfi-amp) which plugs into\nyour current headphones to adjust the sound input for your ears, giving a\nsimilar experience to Creative\u2019s own product. Simply do the hearing test,\nselect your own headphones from a drop down menu (everything from Beats to\nthose cheap headphones that come with iPhones are featured) and you\u2019ll get\nthat Super X-Fi experience on your current favourite pair.\n\n_[Buy now](https://uk.creative.com/p/super-x-fi/creative-sxfi-air)_\n\n### **2\\. Beats Solo3 Wireless**\n\n**Why we like them:** They\u2019re perfectly tuned for modern music\n\n[\u00a3199, Currys PC\nWorld](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&awinaffid=73846&clickref=AsPLCJcLzMnT&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Faudio-\nand-headphones%2Fheadphones%2Fheadphones%2Fbeats-solo-3-wireless-bluetooth-\nheadphones-black-10152178-pdt.html)\n\n![Beats Solo3 Wireless best\nheadphones](/content/dam/recommended/2019/03/25/Beats-Solo3-Wireless_best-\nheadphones_secondary_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?imwidth=480)\n\nWhile the company is one of the most recognisable names in headphones around\nthe world, Beats are still likely to get a few eye-rolls among a professional\ncrowd. \u201cThey\u2019re seen as being a bit basic, a bit \u2018pretend-pro\u2019,\" says Toth.\n\"You wear Beats to seem like you\u2019re an audiophile when you don\u2019t really know\nwhat you\u2019re doing.\"\n\nEven so, there\u2019s no denying that Beats have found a loyal audience and have\nbecome almost a status symbol for the iPhone generation. And to be fair, says\nToth, there\u2019s a good reason for that. \u201cThese are tuned for modern pop music,\nthey\u2019re really good at that. Everything is adjusted just the right amount to\nmake it sound excellent. The high stuff is really shimmery and there\u2019s a nice\nbass on the lower end. You can just chuck these on and you know you\u2019re going\nto get a good experience every time.\u201d\n\nThe design of the Solo3 headphones plays into that millennial luxury feel too.\nThey\u2019re bulky but not too bulky, making just enough of a statement while also\nfeeling comfortable and modest enough to wear casually. The leather pads feel\ngood and don\u2019t easily slip off (no matter how much head-banging you do), and\nthe range of colours is always a nice option.\n\nOne particularly impressive feature is the battery. These babies will last 40\nhours off a full charge, but even plugging them for five minutes gave me three\nhours and seven minutes playtime, making them ideal for forgetful types who\nnever remember to charge their gadgets before a long trip.\n\nOne minor disappointment is that the Solo3 headphones employ a physical button\nto control them. One tap for play/pause, two to skip forwards, three to skip\nbackwards, and a tap at the top or bottom raises or lowers the volume. It\u2019s a\nfairly self-explanatory system, but it's a bit fiddly to use and it feels\nslightly too easy to mess up. You end up pressing the volume button when you\nmean to pause, or triple tap the button too fast and end up pausing the music\nrather than skipping back to the last track.\n\nEither way, if you\u2019re looking for a pair of headphones that you can quickly\nthrow on and enjoy, look no further.\n\n_[Buy\nnow](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&awinaffid=73846&clickref=AsPLCJcLzMnT&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Faudio-\nand-headphones%2Fheadphones%2Fheadphones%2Fbeats-solo-3-wireless-bluetooth-\nheadphones-black-10152178-pdt.html)_\n\n### **3\\. Beyer Dynamic Amiron Wireless**\n\n**Why we like them:** The gold standard for true audiophiles\n\n[\u00a3555.55, Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/beyerdynamic-Amiron-Wireless-High-\nEnd-Headphone-Black-\nSilver/dp/B079P4348N?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&ascsubtag=AsPLCJcLzMnT-21)\n\n![Beyer Dynamic Amiron Wireless\nheadphones](/content/dam/recommended/2019/03/25/Beyer-Dynamic-Amiron-\nWireless_wireless-\nheadphones_secondary_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?imwidth=480)\n\n\u201cBeyer Dynamic are considered the industry standard,\u201d explains Toth as he\ntakes these out of the box.\n\nRight from the off, there\u2019s a noticeably premium feel to these (matching that\neye-watering price). Each one comes with a unique, individual serial number\nwhich is\u2026 well, it\u2019s basically meaningless for most of us, but it does help\nsell the whole \u201cpremium\u201d thing. The cups are made of metal with a luxurious\nand hyper-comfortable suede padding. They clap together nicely to feel tight\nenough on your head to stay in place no matter what.\n\nThese are big, bulky headphones that are designed for studio use, not\nnecessarily meant to be worn on the train to and from work. Still, that\ndoesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not absolutely pitch perfect at what they do.\n\nThe Amiron Wireless headphones are a far cry from Beats in terms of the sound\nthey emit. \u201cThey\u2019re subdued and more professional, the sound quality is super\nclear and defined,\" says Toth. \"They\u2019re ideal for recording, this is what you\nwant if you\u2019re referencing studio mixes.\u201d\n\nBasically, everything is so clear and unmodified that if you need to compare\nminute differences between two tracks, these are the ones you need. But\nthey\u2019re mind-blowingly good at what they do. There\u2019s an incredible thrill in\nhearing music sound this precise; you can imagine the original artist sitting\nin the room, carefully composing every sound, every note, so they were all\njust perfect for you.\n\nHaving said that, Toth does describe the Amiron Wireless headphones as being\n\u201ca cake without a cherry\u201d. He says they\u2019re not ideal for the average listener,\nbecause they don\u2019t really soup up anything, leaving them sounding a bit flat\ncompared to the likes of Beats or Super X-Fi.\n\nEven so, if you\u2019re a true audiophile who wants to listen to music just as it\nwas originally recorded, or a musician who needs to hear with perfect clarity,\nthese are simply the best in the field.\n\n_[B uy now](https://www.amazon.co.uk/beyerdynamic-Amiron-Wireless-High-End-\nHeadphone-Black-\nSilver/dp/B079P4348N?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&ascsubtag=AsPLCJcLzMnT-21)_\n\n### **4\\. Master & Dynamic MW07**\n\n**Why we like them:** They\u2019re a very premium take on true wireless headphones\n\n[\u00a3239.99, Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Master-Dynamic-Bluetooth-Earphones-\nHeadphones-Grey-\nTerrazzo/dp/B07H8RZN47?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&ascsubtag=AsPLCJcLzMnT-21)\n\n![Master & Dynamic MW07 best true wireless\nheadphones](/content/dam/recommended/2019/03/25/Master-Dynamic-MW07_best-true-\nwireless-\nheadphones_secondary_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?imwidth=480)\n\nOur first set of \u2018true wireless\u2019 headphones on this list and they\u2019re a doozy.\nMaster & Dynamic are another big name in the world of headphones and, true to\nform, they\u2019ve crafted a very impressive product here.\n\nOnce again, we\u2019re looking at a product designed to be \u2018premium\u2019. The\nheadphones themselves look unique with a tile-like exterior that has an\ninteresting marble pattern visible in your ears. Master & Dynamic also win\npoints for the charging case, which is made of polished steel rather than the\nplastic of some other options. It looks incredible if you can accept that it\nwill definitely end up covered in fingerprints.\n\nOnce again, each set was hand-made and comes with a distinct serial number.\n\nIt\u2019d be fair to say the headphones aren\u2019t exactly the most comfortable things\nto begin with, although I did find that I got used to them pretty quickly. On\nthe plus side, they stay in your ears nicely; even after a lot of shaking and\njumping around, I couldn\u2019t dislodge them. They come with multiple different\nkinds of ear-tips, so you can personalise the fit.\n\nAs for the sound quality, they\u2019re excellent. Everything is intelligently\nlevelled in a way that seems particularly sensitive to the needs of modern\nmusic, though that\u2019s not to say older stuff doesn\u2019t sound great as well. You\ncan hear every instrument distinctly, which is an important test of quality,\naccording to Toth.\n\nOne thing that did surprise me was just how loud the MW07 units can go. You\nmight think they\u2019d hold back on the volume, given that they\u2019re so small, but\nthat\u2019s not the case at all.\n\nBattery life is a slight disappointment. You only get about three and a half\nhours from the headphones. The case can charge them a further three times too,\nso you could theoretically get 14 hours of battery life altogether, but that\u2019s\nstill considerably less than other true wireless headphones.\n\nStill, there\u2019s no denying the aesthetic of these little earbuds and their\nability to give a good musical performance.\n\n_[Buy now](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Master-Dynamic-Bluetooth-Earphones-\nHeadphones-Grey-\nTerrazzo/dp/B07H8RZN47?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&ascsubtag=AsPLCJcLzMnT-21)_\n\n### **5\\. Status Audio BT One**\n\n**What we like about them:** The price\n\n[\u00a399, Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Status-Audio-Wireless-Headphones-\nJetblack/dp/B07T27FQ5H/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&ascsubtag=customid-21)\n\n![Status Audio BT One best wireless\nheadphones](/content/dam/recommended/2020/02/20/Status-Audio-BT-One_best-\nwireless-\nheadphones_secondary_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?imwidth=480)\n\nWhen you get them out of the box, you probably won\u2019t think much of the BT One.\nAs headphones go, this one is light, plasticky, and feels cheap. There are no\nfrills here: no voice controls, no touch controls, no luxurious metal bits.\n\nHowever, when the headphones go onto your head and you fire up the tunes, it\nsoon becomes clear that Status have really poured all their energy into making\nsure the speakers are up to snuff. I\u2019ve read comments from fellow critics\nwhich claimed that the sound quality was up there with speakers for twice the\nprice and I can't disagree. The sound is rich and full, you can hear every\nthump of the base, while the highs are bright and crisp. There is not a hint\nof fuzziness or warble in any song I listened to. I am deeply impressed.\n\nIn the Beats era where a pair of headphones is as much a fashion accessory as\na means of listening to music, I\u2019m not sure whether the BT One will find its\naudience, but if it doesn\u2019t, it won\u2019t be for want of sound quality.\n\n_[Buy now](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Status-Audio-Wireless-Headphones-\nJetblack/dp/B07T27FQ5H/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&ascsubtag=customid-21)_\n\n### **6\\. Jabra Elite 65T**\n\n[\u00a3149.99, Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Charging-\nOne-touch-Titanium-\nBlack/dp/B078GMZ9PQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&ascsubtag=AsPLCJcLzMnT-21)\n\n![Jabra Elite 65T best wireless\nheadphones](/content/dam/recommended/2019/03/25/Jabra-\nElite-65T_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqs6KvPvMH4OL3HvtIfdYOwlVse9JsN00kzbUr3IXHaGo.png?imwidth=480)\n\nIf I had to describe Jabra\u2019s biggest mistake with these headphones, I would\nput my finger on the word \u201cElite\u201d. Between that name and the description on\nthe box, it\u2019s hard to escape the idea that the brand was aiming to create a\nhigh-end, premium product. But these earbuds feel a bit too plasticky and\ncheap to be a good fit for that market.\n\nHowever, if you can get past the misnomer, Jabra have actually crafted a\nreally very solid headphone here. The sound quality is top notch, says Toth,\nable to hit some of the bassiest levels on the low end while maintaining the\nsharpness on higher end stuff.\n\nIn addition, the battery life is seriously impressive \u2013 five hours off a\nsingle charge, and then a further 15 in the charging case. That\u2019d be fairly\ndecent for a pair of over-ear headphones, let alone some tiny true wireless\nearbuds.\n\nThere\u2019s also some really good noise-cancelling technology which works a treat,\nas well as audio-transparency that you can turn off/on, allowing you to hear\nthe rest of the world while your music is playing; ideal for those who do a\nlot of running on roads.\n\nOne of my personal favourite features was the compatibility with my phone\u2019s\nvoice assistant, with a press of the button. The headphones simply listen out\nfor you to say \u201cHey Siri\u201d or \u201cOK Google\u201d and respond in kind; it\u2019s a handy\nfeature which avoids you needing to press any buttons.\n\nThat being said, Jabra\u2019s big mistake here was the physical buttons used to\ncontrol volume and play/pause and skip through tracks. On an over-ear\nheadphone like the Beats Solo3, the force of the button press is spread across\nyour ear, whereas on an ear-bud, it just feels like you\u2019re jamming it into\nyour ear canal.\n\nHowever, given that you can control your music by simply taking your phone or\nMP3 player out of your pocket, that isn\u2019t necessarily a dealbreaker.\n\nIf you want some top quality true wireless headphones at a reasonable price\npoint, these are a great option.\n\n_[Buy now](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Charging-One-\ntouch-Titanium-\nBlack/dp/B078GMZ9PQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&ascsubtag=AsPLCJcLzMnT-21)_\n\n### **7\\.

Sure, there\u2019s been an app for a long time, but seeing as\nalmost every phone has either Siri or Google Assistant baked in, there\u2019s\nreally been no good reason to use it on the fly. Until now.\n\nThe Echo Buds are a pair of true-wireless headphones which are defined by the\nfact they have three microphones in each bud, designed specifically to listen\nout for voice commands to Alexa.\n\nIt's something that has been tried before, but never successfully. Whenever\nI\u2019ve tested smart assistant enabled headphones, they\u2019ve been poor at picking\nup commands. Generally I\u2019d end up having to get my phone out of my pocket\nanyway. But Amazon and Bose, who collaborated on the Echo Buds, have succeeded\nhere; the headphones picked up my commands every time with no fuss. Even in\ncrowded, noisy, or windy conditions, they had no trouble hearing me.\n\nIf you\u2019re less interested in using Alexa, the Echo Buds are a bit of a mixed\nbag. The speaker quality is certainly impressive, and the basic touch commands\non the headphones work well, but the noise-cancellation just isn\u2019t up to\nscratch. I could hear a constant fuzzy humming. Very distracting.\n\nIf you\u2019re an Alexa-aficionado, look no further, the Echo Buds work well and\nthey\u2019re not too expensive compared to comparable products. If you\u2019re less\nbothered about the smart assistant then you can do better.\n\n_[Buy now](https://www.amazon.co.uk/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-with-\nimmersive-sound-active-noise-reduction-and-\nalexa/dp/B07FWGBDN6/ref=sr_1_1?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&ascsubtag=customid-21)_\n\n### **8\\.

These are the kind of headphones that are easy to stick on\nand enjoy, like Beats.\u201d\n\nThere are other ways these feel nice too. The charging case comes with a\ncharming fabric skin. It\u2019s not the shiny silver box of the Master & Dynamic\nMW07, but for my money, I thought it looked pretty sharp, and hey, at least\nyou won\u2019t spend your life scrubbing fingersprints off this one.\n\nYou can control the headphones by simply tapping on the outside. There\u2019s no\nbutton pressing involved here, so you don\u2019t need to worry about jamming them\ndown your ear canal.\n\nBattery life is reasonable too. You get around four hours of play time off a\nfull charge, then the charging case can give you another eight hours if you\ndon\u2019t mind waiting.\n\nMy only real disappointment was with the fit. I was able to dislodge these\nfrom my head quite easily when I was moving around, so I probably wouldn\u2019t\nrecommend exercising with them in. However, if you\u2019re content to sit at your\ndesk and listen to music, you could do worse.\n\n_[Buy now](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sennheiser-MOMENTUM-True-Wireless-\nTransparent-Black-\nSilver/dp/B07HRHM8F3/ref=asc_df_B07HRHM8F3/?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&ascsubtag=AsPLCJcLzMnT-21)_\n\n### **9\\.

So far, so handy.\n\nUnfortunately the cable is weighted a bit oddly, causing it to bounce around a\nlot when you move. The controls are located on a toggle on the cable, and I\nfound that reaching up to play with them pulled the closest headphone out of\nmy ear about half the time.\n\nThat being said, when you\u2019re not messing with the buttons, BeatsX do fit\nfantastically well and don\u2019t drop out of your ears easily.\n\nAs for the music quality, it\u2019s a little odd. The high stuff is really shimmery\nand sharp, but the middle is pretty flat. The contrast between the two is\nquite strange. Neither would be a negative on its own, but combined they work\nto make music feel very on-edge. It\u2019s not the worst thing in the world but\nToth says he wouldn\u2019t want to listen to them for too long. You\u2019ll only get\neight hours before they\u2019ll need a recharge, so that may not be too much of a\nproblem.\n\n_[Buy\nnow](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&awinaffid=73846&clickref=customid&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fbeats-\nwireless-bluetooth-in-ear-headphones-with-mic-remote%2Fp3813457)_\n\n### **10\\.

They also felt\ncomfortable and clamp securely to your head so they don\u2019t fall off too easily.\n\nThe sound quality is fairly clear, though Toth notes that they sound a little\nflat. \u201cThey need an EQ boost, you want more low-end stuff, and it feels like\nsome clarity is missing here.

They\u2019re very loud, and sound reasonably good\ngiven the relatively low price point.\n\nBattery is decent at four hours (with a further 12 hours charge provided\nthrough the case) and the splash resistance is handy for those who might want\nto run with these.\n\nHowever, all of that is eclipsed by one uber-annoying thing: the damn buttons.\nLike Beats, you have a physical button to press which allows you to\nplay/pause, skip, activate your voice assistant or adjust the volume. So far,\nno problem. The amount of force necessary to get any of these features to\nactivate means you\u2019re basically smacking the buds into your ear canal in a\nmanner which I found to be actively painful.\n\nThat alone makes the Urbanista Tokyo a (literal) pain to use, and hard to\nrecommend.

Music Player has some heavy\nboxes that won\u2019t float across the river. So it breaks them down into teeny\ntiny units that do float. When they get to the other side, Headphones rebuilds\nthem exactly as they were. That\u2019s basically what\u2019s happening with Bluetooth\nexcept it\u2019s basically instantaneous. And it uses radio waves rather than a\nriver, which leads us nicely onto the next question...\n\n### **Are Bluetooth headphones safe?**\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard the (unproven) claims that holding a phone next to your\nhead is bad for your, because the radio waves go through your head and cause\ncancer, right? Bluetooth also uses radio waves, so is it open to the same\naccusations?\n\nWell, even if those claims had been consistently proven, which they haven\u2019t,\nit\u2019s still quite different. A mobile phone transmitter and receiver is much\nmore powerful, designed to project signals over a huge distance. Bluetooth is\ndesigned to transmit and receive from a distance of 10 metres or less. The\nsignal is so weak that it\u2019s not even comparable. So don\u2019t worry about it.\n\n### **Do Bluetooth headphones lose quality?**\n\nWell\u2026 kind of. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you can get some very good quality wireless\nheadphones. Generally the amount of information you can transmit over\nBluetooth is smaller than you\u2019d get with a wired headphone. To circumvent\nthis, Bluetooth transmitters in your music player strip out some of the audio\nquality at frequencies you usually can\u2019t hear to make the file smaller.\nUsually you can\u2019t really tell, but the cumulative effect of stripping out\nthese unnecessary parts of the music file does gradually become noticeable\nafter a while.\n\nThat being said, as I mentioned before, I don\u2019t have an audiophile\u2019s ear, so I\ndidn\u2019t really notice the difference. If you\u2019re big on hearing every detail of\nyour music, go with a wire, but unless you\u2019re a real music nerd, don\u2019t worry\nabout it, you won\u2019t be able to tell.\n\n[Affiliate disclaimer/ review](https://cf-particle-\nhtml.eip.telegraph.co.uk/96742f07-8841-4ae2-88e1-710ca8e1a14c.html \"Affiliate\ndisclaimer/ review\")\n\n### Related Topics\n\n  * [Gadgets](/gadgets-products/)\n  * [Headphones](/headphones/)\n  * [Beats](/beats-by-dre/)\n  * Show more\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n### Follow The Telegraph\n\n  * [ Facebook icon Follow on Facebook  ](https://www.facebook.com/telegraph.co.uk)\n  * [ Twitter icon Follow on Twitter  ](https://twitter.com/@Telegraph)\n  * [ Instagram icon Follow on Instagram  ](https://www.instagram.com/telegraph)\n  * [ LinkedIn icon Follow on LinkedIn  ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/9053)\n\n## More from Telegraph Recommended\n\n  1.
