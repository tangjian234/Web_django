(Also a couple of\nthe sets I initially loved didn\u2019t hold up as well as they should have, so I\nremoved them from the list.) One thing that hasn\u2019t changed in the last 21\nmonths? People are still asking me for headphone and earbud recommendations.\nSo here they are, updated for your 2020 listening pleasure.\n\nIf a friend asks me about the best [Bluetooth\nheadphones](http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-wireless-headphones-\ncheap-bluetooth.html), I like to make some chitchat first. I\u2019ll say, \u201cHey,\nhow\u2019s it going? I haven\u2019t seen you since the [popular music group] show at\n[popular music venue] that time!\u201d And then I like to get down to business. The\nsimple answer to the Bluetooth headphone question is \u2026 well, it depends.\n\nI\u2019m not _the_ leading expert in wireless technology. I wasn\u2019t deconstructing\nradios at age 3 or reading up on near-field communication during recess. What\nI have done in recent years, though, is tested out a lot of wireless\nheadphones across several categories, including those designed for athletes,\nthose made for kids, and a few pairs created with [the genuine\naudiophile](http://nymag.com/strategist/2016/11/the-best-wireless-headphones-\nare-the-sennheiser-momentum.html) in mind. I\u2019ve been testing and writing about\ngear since 2011, and in that time I\u2019ve used so many dozens of\n[headphones](http://nymag.com/strategist/2016/11/jbl-best-bluetooth-\nheadphones-under-150-holiday-gift-ideas-2016.html) (plus\n[speakers](http://nymag.com/strategist/2017/03/best-portable-wireless-\nbluetooth-speakers-on-amazon.html), [battery\npacks](http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-portable-battery-chargers-on-\namazon-phone-and-laptop.html), and [electric\ntoothbrushes](http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-electronic-and-\nrechargeable-toothbrushes.html)) that I\u2019ve become the go-to guy for gadget\nrecommendations around my circle of friends.\n\nSo while I\u2019m not the very tip-top expert in wireless sonic whatnot, I am a guy\nwho has tried a lot of such whatnot firsthand, and I\u2019m a man who knows what he\nlikes. Below, the best Bluetooth headphones for most people \u2014 these are the\nones I recommend when people ask me what to buy.\n\n##  Best wireless (mostly) earbuds for under $30\n\n[ ![4.

A\npair of SoundPEATS Magnetic Earphones is currently $28. These compact, little\nin-ear devices are well worth their tiny price tag. The audio quality is quite\ngood for the earbud category, and the eight-hour battery life is nothing to\nscoff at, considering the compact size of the hardware (many top out at six\nhours). Also, they connect to one another via magnet to make a necklace you\ncan wear when you\u2019re not using them, which is handy for not losing your\nearphones. (You can always put them in your pocket.)\n\n[ $24  at Amazon  Buy\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074THH5Q2?ascsubtag=\\[\\]st\\[p\\]cjezq15y7006efzy6aw6f9bax\\[i\\]TaAUcI&tag=thestrategistsite-20)\n\n[ $24  at Amazon  Buy\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074THH5Q2?ascsubtag=\\[\\]st\\[p\\]cjezq15y7006efzy6aw6f9bax\\[i\\]TaAUcI&tag=thestrategistsite-20)\n\n##  Best wireless headphones for under $30\n\n[ ![Creative Sound Blaster Jam Ultra-Light Bluetooth\nHeadset](https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/047/836/79c8ec5e0244a4577b017224fa149334bc-3----.rhorizontal.w600.jpg)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SA1IAWG?ascsubtag=\\[\\]st\\[p\\]cjezq15y7006efzy6aw6f9bax\\[i\\]keG3M6&tag=thestrategistsite-20)\n\n[ Creative Sound Blaster Jam Ultra-Light Bluetooth Headset\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SA1IAWG?ascsubtag=\\[\\]st\\[p\\]cjezq15y7006efzy6aw6f9bax\\[i\\]keG3M6&tag=thestrategistsite-20)\n\n~~$104~~ now 56% off\n\n$46\n\nIt\u2019s only by a penny, but a new sale puts these passable headphones at just\nunder $30.

The Trond\nTD-BH01 headphones do that mostly because they, you know, create great audio\nquality. But almost as important, these low-lag headphones mean there\u2019s no\nperceptible delay between the visuals and the audio of your movie, show, or\ngame. Which is important because nothing breaks down that fourth wall like\nsomeone\u2019s lips and words not lining up. Also, you can use these headphones\nwith a Bluetooth connection or hardwired, so when you\u2019re gaming or watching TV\nat home, no need to worry about battery life. And speaking of life, you\nhaven\u2019t lived until immersed in the aural universe of old-school Nintendo\n_Mario_ being piped to your ears via Trond TD-BH01 headphones.\n\n[ $60  at Amazon  Buy\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075VLWPXF?ascsubtag=\\[\\]st\\[p\\]cjezq15y7006efzy6aw6f9bax\\[i\\]dYO55A&tag=thestrategistsite-20)\n\n[ $60  at Amazon  Buy\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075VLWPXF?ascsubtag=\\[\\]st\\[p\\]cjezq15y7006efzy6aw6f9bax\\[i\\]dYO55A&tag=thestrategistsite-20)\n\n##  Best wireless headphones for long battery life\n\n[ ![Jlab Audio Epic Air\nSport](https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/74c/77a/1acdc6393f18ab1d9f603742dcd466dc64-jlab-\naudio-epic.rhorizontal.w600.jpg)\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R4BXTC2?ascsubtag=\\[\\]st\\[p\\]cjezq15y7006efzy6aw6f9bax\\[i\\]6BbbpF&tag=thestrategistsite-20)\n\n[ Jlab Audio Epic Air Sport\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R4BXTC2?ascsubtag=\\[\\]st\\[p\\]cjezq15y7006efzy6aw6f9bax\\[i\\]6BbbpF&tag=thestrategistsite-20)\n\n$149\n\nI have yet to have my Jlabs die on me during a run, flight, or anything else.\nWith a full charge, these things have a ten-hour battery life, which is just\nabout the top of the pack for true wireless earbuds.
