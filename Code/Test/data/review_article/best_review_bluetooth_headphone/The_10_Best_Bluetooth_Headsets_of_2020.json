Its\nPresence Grey Business headset is pricey, but it won\u2019t leave you wanting for\nmuch. Sennheiser put its audio expertise into practice to deliver crystal\nclear calls from the headset's three microphones, which work in concert to\nfilter out background [noise](https://www.lifewire.com/measure-noise-\ncancelling-in-headphones-3134548). To sweeten the pot, it can detect your\nvoice and adjust the sound to a moderate level to keep your caller happy.\n\nThe Sennheiser Presence Grey Business is intuitive and easy to use. It\nfeatures one-button control for calls and virtual assistant needs and a\nsliding mechanism makes it painless to power the headset on and off at a\nmoment\u2019s notice.

The main reason is the\nbattery life, which maxes out at a 17-hour runtime and is ideal for the long\nroutes truckers brave. If you're going even further, you should have no\nproblem juicing back up between each rest stop with the quick two-hour charge\ntime.\n\nThe lone earpiece, with dedicated buttons for volume and song control, leaves\nyour other ear free to hear road-noise, while a boom microphone complete with\nintegrated mute and multi-function buttons helps detect your voice over a\ndiesel engine\u2019s roar.

Like any top-tier Bluetooth headset, it has three noise-canceling\nmicrophones that Plantronics says can separate 80dB worth of background noise\nfrom your voice, and Lifewire reviewers found it effective at the task. It\nincludes stainless steel windscreens, plus hardware and software-based audio\nprocessing wizardry for sharp call performance. Many of those components live\nwithin the device\u2019s brick of an ear hook, but the size is forgivable if the\ntrade-off is water resistance and high-quality performance.\n\nThe Voyager Legend is perfect for busier people because of its hands-free\nfunctionality.

He has been writing for tech and media\ncompanies for almost a decade.\n\n##  The Ultimate Bluetooth Headset Buying Guide\n\nIf you\u2019re driving, shopping, exercising, working, or even just hanging out\naround the house, a Bluetooth headset allows you to answer the phone and\ncontrol some of your phone\u2019s features and functions without having to\nconstantly have it in hand. A Bluetooth headset also helps those working at a\ndesk, as you don\u2019t have to be tethered to your laptop by that dreadful cord\nwhen you\u2019re sitting in a meeting.\n\nWhen picking out a Bluetooth headset, there are several factors to consider.\nIn addition to choosing a headset that looks and feels good while you\u2019re\nwearing it, you also want to make sure it fits your needs. Factors like\nbattery life, compatibility, pairing, sound quality, noise cancellation, water\nresistance, and cost all come into play. We put together an in-depth guide,\nincluding just about everything you need to know to choose the right Bluetooth\nheadset for you.\n\n###  Bluetooth Headphones vs. Bluetooth Headsets\n\nIf you\u2019re primarily interested in music playback, you\u2019ll want a good pair of\nthe [best wireless headphones](https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-\nheadphones-4045248). Headphones don\u2019t necessarily provide a microphone for\nspeech, while a headset always has a microphone. Headphones are optimized for\nsound quality, so you can get the best possible listening experience.\n\nA headset is optimized for conversation, so you can talk on your phone (or\nanother Bluetooth device) hands-free. Headsets often have other controls, like\na button to answer calls, so you can use your phone\u2019s voice assistant.\nFeatures like noise cancellation help promote the best environment for\nconversing back and forth, and a headset\u2019s engineering focuses on the listener\nand the speaker.\n\n###  Styles: Headband, neckband, or earpiece\n\nHeadband style headsets are often larger and heavier than the other Bluetooth\nheadset styles. They\u2019ll typically have an ear cuff that goes on the ear with a\nspeaker for listening, and a microphone that protrudes out for speaking. The\nheadband portion goes around the top of the head and then rests against the\nopposite side. The headband style is often the preferred style for business\nprofessionals who work at a desk.\n\nIf a headband style isn\u2019t comfortable for you, but still you want the\nstability of a band, you may want to go with a neckband style, which wraps\naround the back of the neck. Some neckbands have short wires that connect to\nearbuds that go into the ears, and other neckbands are foldable for easier\nstorage. Many runners and gym-goers prefer the neckband style.\n\nIf you want a smaller, less noticeable Bluetooth headset, go with an earpiece\nor in-ear style headset. These types of headsets are very small\u2014often around\ntwo to three inches in size\u2014and they may wrap around one ear. Instead of\nhaving an ear cuff that rests on the outside of the ear, they usually have an\near cushion you gently place in your ear canal. This type of headset is more\nversatile, and the style is ideal for gym-goers, business professionals, and\nregular day-to-day users.\n\n![Plantronics Voyager 5200](//:0)\n\nLifewire / Jason Schneider\n\n###  Battery life\n\nBattery life is perhaps the most important factor to consider when choosing a\nBluetooth headset, especially when you\u2019re using your headset on-the-go. There\nare four main battery life numbers you need to pay attention to: mAH (which\nstands for milliampere hours), charge time, talk time, and standby time.\n\nWhen you look at mAh for a battery, it\u2019s basically just a formula that\ncalculates battery storage capacity. It\u2019s the product of the time a battery\nlasts times the discharge current. So, a 1,000 mAh battery in a headset that\ndraws 50 milliamps of power would last for 20 hours (1,000 divided by 50\nmilliamps equals 20 hours).\n\nCharge time represents how long the headset takes to reach a full charge. Most\nBluetooth headsets should take between one and five hours to reach a full\ncharge. Talk time represents how long you can use the Bluetooth headset in\ncalls and meetings before a single battery charge runs out, and standby time\nrepresents how long the headset can sit off of the charger without being used\nand still maintain a single battery charge. Sometimes, you\u2019ll also see a\nmetric for music time, which represents how long you can listen to music on a\nsingle charge.\n\nTalk time and standby time will vary widely by the manufacturer, the type and\nstyle of headset, and the features it offers. The price of the unit doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily have an impact on its battery life. For instance, the New Bee\nearpiece Bluetooth headset sells for less than $20, but it provides 24 hours\nof talk time and about 60 days of standby time. However, the Jabra Steel\nretails for around $100, but it has six hours of talk time and around 10 days\nof standby time.\n\n###  Charging stands, charging cases, and backup batteries\n\nSome headsets offer charging accessories that can help manage battery life. If\nyou\u2019re worried about running out of battery, you may want to look at a headset\nthat comes with a charging stand, a charging case, or a backup battery.\n\nSome headband style headsets may include a charging station or stand where you\ncan rest your headset when it\u2019s not in use. You may also be able to purchase a\ncompatible charging stand after the fact. For instance, Plantronics offers its\nPlantronics Spare charging stand, which is compatible with its Voyager Focus\nUC headset. If you\u2019re using your headset primarily at a desk, charging stands\ncan be particularly helpful because they allow you to keep the device charging\nwhen you get off of a call.\n\nYou may also see charging cases. The case can extend the battery life by\nadding additional on-the-go charges. You may get ten hours of talk time on a\nsingle charge, but the charging case lets you charge the device three more\ntimes without having to connect to an electrical outlet.\n\nWhile not as common, a handful of headsets (like the Aminy UFO) come with two\nbatteries. This allows you to charge one battery while you use the other.\n\n###  Compatibility and connectivity\n\nBefore choosing a Bluetooth headset, you\u2019ll want to make sure it\u2019ll connect\nseamlessly to all of the devices you need it to. Take note of the Bluetooth\nversion. Most headsets will be either Bluetooth version 4.1, 4,2, or 5.0. In\nthe product\u2019s description, it\u2019ll also sometimes indicate which devices it\nworks with. However, most headsets will work with most modern phones and\nBluetooth compatible laptops/PCs, as modern Bluetooth versions are backwards\ncompatible.\n\nIf you plan on using your headset on multiple devices, you\u2019ll want to make\nsure the headset can connect to more than one device. The product should\nindicate that it connects to more than one device, or it may say it has a\nmulti-pairing feature that allows you to use it with more than one device at a\ntime. For instance, the Jabra Steel can connect to up to eight devices, and it\ncan connect to two devices simultaneously with its multi-use feature.\n\n![Mpow Pro Trucker Bluetooth Headset](//:0)\n\nLifewire / Jason Schneider\n\n###  Bluetooth range\n\nHow far is the [Bluetooth](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bluetooth-2377412)\nrange? This number indicates how far you can travel away from the device to\nwhich the headset is connected, and still experience clear audio. If the range\nis up to 10 meters, this means you can go up to 10 meters away from your phone\nor laptop before you start to experience connection issues. Keep in mind this\nis an \u201cup to\u201d number, and obstructions like walls, floors, and appliances may\nimpact the range. If you\u2019re planning on travelling to a different room than\nyour device when you\u2019re using your headset, look for a headset with a longer\nrange.\n\n###  Sound quality\n\nWith headphones, you\u2019ll often see metrics that measure sound quality like\nsensitivity (which measures sound efficiency), frequency response (which\nmeasures the speakers\u2019 ability to produce low and high tones), and impedance\n(which measures resistance). You\u2019re less likely to see these metrics with\nheadsets because the focus is less on music playback and more on battery life,\ncall quality, features, and overall performance.\n\n###  Noise-canceling\n\nThere are two main types of [noise-\ncanceling](https://www.lifewire.com/measure-noise-cancelling-in-\nheadphones-3134548) in the context of Bluetooth headsets: Noise-cancelling in\nthe headphone (speaker) and noise-canceling in the microphone. The first type\nof noise-canceling\u2014in the speaker\u2014helps block out background noise in the\nvicinity of the person wearing the headset, so they can better hear music or\nspeech without disturbances from background noise. The second type\u2014noise\ncancelling in the microphone\u2014blocks out noise for the person on the other end\nof the call, so they can hear your speech over background sounds like planes\nflying by, people talking in the background, or a television.\n\nMost Bluetooth headsets, even budget headsets, will have some type of noise-\ncanceling technology in the microphone. This is an important feature for those\nwho are using a headset for business, or for those who are using a headset out\nin public areas.\n\n###  Active vs. passive noise-canceling\n\nIf a headset has active noise cancellation, this means the headset uses sound\nwaves to help counteract, or cancel out, background noises.\n\nPassive noise cancellation means the headset uses hardware (extra padding,\ntighter seals, etc.) to reduce background noises.\n\nIf noise cancellation is an important feature for you, and you need your\nconversations to be as clear and noise-free as possible, look carefully at the\nproduct\u2019s noise-canceling technology. Look at how it cancels out noise, and\nnot just whether or not it has noise-canceling.\n\n###  Water resistance\n\nWater resistance is less common on headband style headsets, as the headband\nstyle is more often used indoors by a business professional at a desk.\nHowever, for neckband and earpiece style Bluetooth headsets, water resistance\nis becoming more of a common feature.\n\nIf the product is water resistant, this means it can usually tolerate rain,\nsweat, spills, and splashes. The product will indicate water resistance in the\ndescription of if it has this feature. It should also indicate a water\nresistance rating (something like IPX5 or IPX8). This indicates the degree of\nwater resistance a device features\u2014an IPX5 rated headset can withstand water\njets from any direction, for instance, while one with an IPX8 rating is\nprotected from being immersed in water of more than three meters in depth.\nSome devices will be rated with a pair of numbers, in which case the first\nnumber indicates particle protection, shielding it from dust and dirt, and the\nsecond indicating water resistance. In both cases, IP stands for Ingress\nProtection.\n\nSome headsets may also be shockproof, which means the headset won\u2019t easily\nbreak if you drop the device. If you\u2019re planning on using your headset\noutdoors or during periods of heavy activity, this may be important for you.\n\n![Plantronics Voyager 5200](//:0)\n\nLifewire / Jason Schneider\n\n###  Brands and Manufacturers\n\nWith some devices, like phones and laptops, the brand is significant. Going\nwith a trusted brand typically leads to a better experience. With Bluetooth\nheadsets, this isn\u2019t necessarily the case, and you can find quality headsets\nfrom big-name brands like Jabra, Plantronics, and Sennheiser, as well as from\nbrands you\u2019ve never heard of. We\u2019ve tested a number of headsets here at\nLifewire, and we\u2019ve included information on a few brands below.\n\n###  Jabra\n\nJabra is known for making headsets for workers across every type of\nprofession, as well as headsets for the everyday user. Products like the Jabra\nSteel headset are durable and designed for an outdoorsy professional, while\nheadsets like the Jabra Evolve 65 UC are meant for the professional who\nprimarily sits at a desk. Jabra also makes units like the Jabra Style, which\nare ideal for the everyday user or worker on the go. Most Jabra headsets are\nhigh quality, but the battery lives on Jabra sets often aren\u2019t as good as\nyou\u2019d see in other headsets, even those that cost less.\n\n###  Plantronics\n\n[Plantronics](https://www.lifewire.com/best-plantronics-headphones-4157754) is\na leader in business headsets, and the brand creates a lot of headband-style\nunits. Plantronics units are pricey but you can usually expect high quality.\nMost modern Plantronics headsets also offer excellent noise cancellation and\nmore advanced features. The [Voyager\n5200](https://www.lifewire.com/plantronics-voyager-5200-review-4589379), for\ninstance, has Alexa built-in, it has four-microphone noise cancellation, and\nit has technology that detects wind direction so your voice comes through\nclearly outdoors.\n\n###  New Bee\n\nA lesser-known brand, New Bee, has a highly rated headset that costs less than\nthe price of two large pizzas, yet it has 60 days of standby battery and comes\nwith all the accessories you could ever want. A budget headset like this won\u2019t\noffer the same performance and features as a flagship headset from a brand\nlike Plantronics, but it will serve its purpose well for those who don\u2019t want\nto spend a ton of cash.\n\n###  Accessories\n\nHeadband-style headsets may not come with too many accessories outside of a\ncharging cable, but in-ear style headsets often come with a variety of\naccessories like extra ear cushions, ear hooks, charging cables, and carrying\ncases. Neckband style headsets also typically come with accessories like a\ncharging cable, carrying case, and extra ear gels. Look for accessories that\npromote comfort and flexibility.\n\nDifferent sizes of ear cushions can be important because there\u2019s nothing worse\nthan having a headset that doesn\u2019t fit properly. If your headset is too big\nfor your ear, it won\u2019t feel comfortable, and it may even fall out while you're\nrunning errands or working out.
