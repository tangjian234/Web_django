Plantronics Voyager Focus UC\n\n> **BEST MICROPHONE**\n\nWhen you\u2019re in the office and need to be on the phone all day, you\u2019ll be hard-\npressed to find a more comfortable over-the-ear headset than the Plantronics\nVoyager Focus UC. Comfort truly is the name of the game here. The two soft\npads fit nicely over your ears so they won\u2019t get sore after long periods of\nuse. Also, the adjustable metal headband lets you wear the headset comfortably\nwithout messing up your hair. You can turn on the ANC (active noise\ncancellation) to cancel out the noise around you, as well. For the caller, the\ntriple boom mic has advanced digital sound processing capabilities to ensure\nyour voice sounds loud and clear with minimal interference. This is easily one\nof the best Bluetooth headsets for phone calls that comes with stereo\nheadphones, especially if you need to wear your headset all day.\n\n![best bluetooth headset for phone\ncalls](https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/plantronics-\nfocus.png?w=409&h=575) Courtesy of Amazon\n\n[ Buy:  Plantronics Voyager Focus UC  $167.50\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013F4LJTI?tag=spycom00-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n[ buy it\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013F4LJTI?tag=spycom00-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n## 12\\. Jabra Steel\n\n> **MOST RUGGED**\n\nThe Jabra Steel was built for those who tend to do most of their business\noutside and work in noisy environments. This Bluetooth headset is IP54-rated,\nmeaning it\u2019s water-, dust- and shock-resistant. So, if you\u2019re caught in a\nrainstorm, you won\u2019t have to worry about your headset getting ruined. And for\nwindy days, the Steel comes with a windsock to go over the boom mic to help\ncancel out some of the outside noise. For the workers who tend to need gloves\nwhile they work, the buttons on the Jabra Steel are large and easy to press,\neven with gloves on. That being said, if you are mainly in the office taking\ncalls, there are better sounding options like the Jabra UC or Plantronics\nVoyager 5200. Still, it\u2019s a great option if you need something that can\nsurvive a bit of punishment.\n\n![best bluetooth headset for phone\ncalls](https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/jabra-steel.png?w=402&h=423)\nCourtesy of Amazon\n\n[ Buy:  Jabra Steel\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0194VYPQ0?tag=spycom00-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n[ buy it\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0194VYPQ0?tag=spycom00-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n## 13\\. Sennheiser Presence-UC\n\n> **AMAZON\u2019S CHOICE**\n\nThe Sennheiser Presence-UC does a good job of eliminating background noise and\nfocusing solely on your voice. It\u2019s a tiny headset that fits comfortably\naround one ear. The microphone slides out about a half-inch from the headset,\nwhich shortens the distance from the headset to your mouth and also powers up\nthe device. Once on, the Presence-UC uses noise-canceling technology to remove\nbackground noise for whoever is one the other end of the call. This is good\nand bad. It\u2019s good because it keeps the focus on the voice alone, but it does\nmake the audio sound a little choppy, as the audio can shut off between words.\nThis doesn\u2019t hinder phone calls in any way, but you can just noticeably tell\nthat background noise is disappearing. Thanks to the proactive noise-\ncanceling, compact package and sleek design, this is a top Bluetooth headset\nfor phone calls.\n\n![best bluetooth headset for phone\ncalls](https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/sennheiser-presence-\nuc.png?w=500&h=455) Courtesy of Amazon\n\n[ Buy:  Sennheiser Presence-UC  $169.99\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ES51QWO?tag=spycom00-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n[ buy it\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ES51QWO?tag=spycom00-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n## 14\\. Plantronics Voyager 5200\n\n> **BEST UNDER $100**\n\nThe Plantronics Voyager 5200 uses four microphones to help your voice cut\nthrough while shutting the door on background noise. The extra microphones can\neven silence the wind, so your voice continues to sound clear even while\nwalking down the street. While on the phone, you won\u2019t have to struggle to\nhear the other person, since the Plantronics has one of the more powerful\nspeakers built-in. The device is also adjustable, so it can be worn on both\nears and comes with three different size tips. That said, it\u2019s a bit on the\nbulky side, so your ears might begin to fatigue after wearing it all day. If\nyou want great clarity, especially if you are on the go outside, you should\nconsider the Voyager 5200.\n\n![best bluetooth headset for phone\ncalls](https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/plantronics-\nvoyager-5200.png?w=500&h=434) Courtesy of Amazon\n\n[ Buy:  Plantronics Voyager 5200\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H2RBQUG?tag=spycom00-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n[ buy it\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H2RBQUG?tag=spycom00-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n## 15\\.
