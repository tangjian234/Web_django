Most headsets connect\nwithin a range of 10 to 30 meters.\n\n**NFC:** Near field communication allows you to connect your headset to your\nphone by simply tapping them together, instead of having to open your setting\nand manually pair them, which can save some time when taking calls. It works\nby sending small amounts of data through radio waves. The waves can travel\nonly a short distance\u2014at most, 4 inches\u2014and connect the two devices\ninstantaneously, allowing for a seamless and convenient transaction.\n\n **Bluetooth:** Most headsets will be equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 or 4.2.\nThese are perfectly adequate for headsets, and there will not be much of a\ndifference between the two. Basically, with each new bluetooth version that\ncomes out (the newest being 5), the connection becomes faster and has a\ngreater range. But for the purposes of connecting to a nearby device like a\nsmartphone, the difference between 4 and 5 likely won\u2019t be noticeable.\n\n#### Wireless Headsets vs. Headphones\n\nWhile there is some overlap between the capability of a headset versus\nheadphones, there are some significant differences that you will want to note\nbefore diving into a purchase. Headsets are geared more toward a work\nenvironment, often including only one ear attachment. Most will have a high-\nquality mic\u2014often one that extends from the device\u2014 that allows for clear\nphone calls, as that is the priority. Some even come with rugged exteriors and\nsweat-proofing that allow for use in outdoor work environments. Headphones are\nmainly geared toward providing quality audio for music or podcasts. While many\nhave mic capabilities, they are generally not going to be as high quality as a\nheadset mic, so you can take calls on them, but you are better off with a\nheadset if call quality is top priority.\n\n#### **How We Selected and Rated Them**\n\nWe researched 10 expert sources such as[ __Digital\nTrends__](https://www.digitaltrends.com/), [__Tech\nRadar__](https://www.techradar.com/), and [__PC\nMag__](https://www.pcmag.com/), as well as 7,600 consumer reviews to select\nthe top six bluetooth headsets of the year.

With 7 hours of\ntalk time and up to 9 days in standby mode, it can easily get you through a\nfull work day, if not the whole week. It features voice-control commands for\nwhen your hands are busy, and the design fits snugly on your ear so it won\u2019t\nslip off. Unfortunately, it is not as comfortable as some previous Voyagers:\nThey proved problematic for people attempting to wear with glasses since the\near hook is a bit short, and glasses push it higher than it should usually\nsit, according to _[PC Mag](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/plantronics-\nvoyager-5200)_. It also certainly does not have a minimal design, but at least\nothers will know that you aren\u2019t talking to yourself when on a call.\n\n* * *\n\n#### \u2014For the Outdoors\u2014\n\n### Jabra Steel Ruggedized Bluetooth Headset\n\n**Expert Score:** 74/100 | **Consumer Score:** 60% gave it 4 stars or more  \n _For clear calls in dirty situations._\n\nWeight: 10g | Battery life: 6 hours | NFC: Yes | Bluetooth: 4.1 | Wireless\nrange: 30m\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0194VYPQ0?linkCode=ogi)\n\nJabra\n\nJabra Steel Ruggedized Bluetooth Headset\n\n$99.99\n\n$64.95 (35% off)\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0194VYPQ0?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * Rugged design\n  * Voice control and large buttons\n  * NFC connection\n\n###\n\n  * Only 6 hour battery\n\nWhether you work outdoors or just need to take calls on your commute, this\nheadset will keep you connected while staying protected against the elements.\nIt is resistant to dust and water, and has a durable, rubberized design to\nprotect the technology within. It connects instantly by NFC, and pairs with\nthe Jabra Assist app which can read text, show the battery life, and help you\nlocate the headset if lost within range. It also has large buttons that are\neasy to use even with gloves on, but the volume has to be controlled from your\nphone. \u201cI like the button placement,\u201d wrote an [_Amazon\nreviewer_](https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B079YBKT3H/?linkCode=ogi).\n\u201cMost of the units I have used like to put the buttons right over the ear\nentrance.

The sweat-resistant and\nnoise-cancelling AYL headphones provide fairly clear audio even when banging\nout reps in the gym or sprinting it out in the last mile. For those of us who\ncan\u2019t keep work and play separate, this headset is able to pair with two\ndevices at once, allowing you to listen to music from your watch and quickly\nswitch to your phone when you need to take a call. And no need to be\nsuspicious of the price\u2014Amazon reviewers claimed they not only preferred this\nheadset over more expensive options, but also found them to be incredibly\ndurable. It should be noted, however, that this is predominantly a headphone,\nso if you have a lot of long and important calls to make, you may want to opt\nfor something with a better mic.\n\n* * *\n\n#### \u2014For All-Day Wear\u2014\n\n### Plantronics Bluetooth Headset 3200 Voyager  \n\n **Expert Score:** 84/100 | **Consumer Score:** 75% gave it 4 stars or more  \n_Comfortable and neatly discreet._\n\nWeight: 10g | Battery life: 6 hours | NFC: No | Bluetooth: 4.1 | Wireless\nrange: 30m\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZY6WRHL?linkCode=ogi)\n\nAmazon\n\nPlantronics\n\nPlantronics Voyager 3200\n\n$129.99\n\n$99.99 (23% off)\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZY6WRHL?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * Lightweight\n  * Comfortable\n\n###\n\n  * Not great call quality\n\nThis Voyager is less expensive than the Plantronics 5200, but it excels in one\nparticular area: comfort. If you are looking for something to wear all day,\nthis is the way to go. It features 6 hours of talk time, and has the same\nlarge range, perfect for those who pace while in a deep discussion. It has\nnoise-cancelling abilities and hands-free voice commands, but also includes\nmanual controls if you prefer. It is also incredibly light, and more discreet\nthan some other Voyager models. Reviewers at __[PC\nMag](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/plantronics-voyager-3200),__ however, felt\nthat the call quality was a bit subpar, and the battery life could be better\nwhen compared to other Plantronics models.\n\n* * *\n\n#### \u2014Most Premium\u2014\n\n### Sennheiser Presence UC 504576\n\n **Expert Score:** 83/100 | **Consumer Score:** 58% gave it 4 stars or more  \n _The clearest sound on windy days._\n\nWeight: 13g | Battery life: 10 hours | NFC: No | Bluetooth: 4.0 | Wireless\nrange: 25m\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ES51QWO?linkCode=ogi)\n\nSennheiser\n\nSennheiser Presence UC\n\n$169.99\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ES51QWO?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * Dual connectivity\n  * Voice recognition\n\n###\n\n  * Expensive\n\nIf you are willing to splurge a bit, the Sennheiser headset is a top-of-the-\nline option that will ensure you\u2019ll have a clear, uninterrupted call no matter\nwhere you are. The headset has not one, but three mics that are able to detect\nthe difference between your voice and outside sounds such as wind or\nconstruction. It\u2019s also noise-cancelling and the battery life provides up to\n10 hours of call time. No worries about fit either, as it comes with five\nadjustable options to make sure it won\u2019t fall out mid-convo. And for serial\nmultitaskers, it also has multi-connection ability, which makes it easy to\nswitch between multiple phones or devices.\n\n* * *\n\n### \u2014Over-Ear Headset\u2014\n\n### Plantronics Voyager Focus UC Bluetooth USB B825\n\n **Expert Score:** 85/100 | **Consumer Score:** 80% gave it 4 stars or more  \n _Stay comfy and talk for hours._\n\nWeight: 15g | Battery life: 12 hours | NFC: No | Bluetooth: 4.0 | Wireless\nrange: 30m\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013F4LJTI?linkCode=ogi)\n\nAmazon\n\nPlantronics\n\nPlantronics Voyager Focus UC\n\n$189.99\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013F4LJTI?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * Long battery life\n  * Comfortable\n\n###\n\n  * Bulky\n\nI\u2019ll start with the disclaimer that you probably won\u2019t want to wear these out\nof the house. The Plantronics Voyager B8235 is a heavy-duty headset with a mic\nand double ear coverage. However, if you plan on working from home or need\nsome serious noise-cancelling for your office environment, this headset is for\nyou. It also comes with a stand that will both store and charge it. While\nit\u2019ll certainly be heavier than more portable options, this model is still\ncomfortable, and best of all, has a battery life of 12 hours.\n\nThis commenting section is created and maintained by a third party, and\nimported onto this page.
