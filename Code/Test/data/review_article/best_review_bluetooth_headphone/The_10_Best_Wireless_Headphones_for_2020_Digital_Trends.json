We\u2019ve rounded up some more excellent\nwireless headphone picks, at a variety of price points and styles for multiple\nuses to make sure you can take beautiful music along no matter where you go.\n\n## **The best wireless headphones at a glance**\n\n  *     * Best wireless headphones: Sony WH-1000XM3\n    * Best noise-canceling earbuds: Sony WF-1000XM3\n    * Best budget wireless headphones: Shure SE112 Wireless\n    * Best wireless headphones for running: JLab Epic Air Sport\n    * Best wireless headphones for calls: Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700\n    * Best wireless headphones for iPhone: Apple AirPods Pro\n    * Best wireless headphones for Android: Google Pixel Buds 2\n    * Best wireless headphones for gaming: Astro Gaming A50\n    * Best wireless headphones for kids: Puro PuroQuiet\n    * Best for sound quality: Sennheiser Momentum 3\n\n## The Best Wireless Headphones: Sony WH-1000XM3\n\n![Sony WH-1000XM3 Best headphones\n2018](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n**Why you should buy them:** Top-tier sound, excellent comfort, and (of\ncourse) impressive noise-canceling make Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM3 the headphones to\nbeat.\n\n**Who they\u2019re for** : Those who are looking for total sonic isolation and\nwireless convenience, but don\u2019t want to give up high-fidelity sound to get it.\n\n**Why we picked the Sony WH-1000XM3:**\n\nSony makes some incredible wireless noise-canceling headphones. In fact, in\nthe last iteration of this article, Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM2 earned the top spot (and\na 5/5 rating in [our official review](https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-\nreviews/sony-wh-1000xm2-review/)), thanks to an unbeatable blend of comfort,\ncontrol, and audio quality \u2014 not to mention the fact that they isolate sound\nas well as any cans we\u2019ve used. They weren\u2019t just our favorite noise-canceling\nheadphones \u2014 they were our [favorite headphones \u2014\nperiod](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/best-headphones/).\n\nThis time around, we\u2019ve decided to elevate another pair of Sony phones to the\napex of our list \u2014 the WH-1000XM3, which actually improve upon their\npredecessors in many small ways. Underneath ultra-soft leatherette earcups,\nthe WH-1000XM3 pack in dual 40mm dynamic drivers that bring both movies and\nmusic to life with stunning, warm detail. The headphones offer excellent\ninstrumental separation, with powerful bass response matched by precise\nperformance in the mid and upper registers.\n\nThe Sony Headphones Connect app allows for lots of personalization and fine-\ntuning, letting you adjust ambient sound reduction and optimize audio based on\natmospheric pressure (an awesome feature for frequent flyers). Sony\u2019s[ DSEE\nHX](https://www.sony.com/electronics/play-music-library-near-hi-res-audio-\nsound-quality) processing engine also automatically upscales compressed audio\nfrom sources like YouTube to ensure the best possible listening experience.\nThey also offer plenty of other cool features, including the ability to pause\nwhen you pull off an earpad, which is great for ordering a drink on a long\nflight. And as for battery life? Their 30 hours are among the best in the\nbusiness.\n\nSimply put, there are no better headphones with noise cancellation (wireless\nor otherwise) on the market right now. At least until the long-awaited [Sony\nWH-1000XM4 ](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/sony-\nwh1000xm4-release-date-price-photos-specs/)are ready for release.\n\n**[Read our full Sony WH-1000XM3\nreview](https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/sony-\nwh-1000xm3-review/)**\n\n## Best noise-canceling earbuds: Sony WF-1000XM3\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)Dan\nBaker/Digital Trends\n\n**Why you should buy them:** The convenience of no wires at all, plus active\nnoise cancellation is a unique combo we think you\u2019ll love.\n\n**Who they\u2019re for:** Anyone who wants noise cancellation but doesn\u2019t want to\ntote around or wear a full-size set of headphones.\n\n**Why we picked the Sony WF-1000XM3:**\n\nThere are now a ludicrous number of truly-wireless earbuds on the market, but\nat the moment, there is only one model that provides the same active noise-\ncanceling technology found in high-end headphones like the Sony WH-1000XM3.\nThat model is the Sony WF-1000XM3, and as the name suggests, they\u2019re the\ntruly-wireless earbud equivalents of Sony\u2019s incredible best-of-the-best\nheadphones. These earbuds manage to combine superb sound quality, awesome\nnoise cancellation, and astonishing battery life into a single, convenient\npackage.\n\nSony brings all of its technical know-how to these earbuds: They feature the\ncompany\u2019s DSEE HX sound processing, which has an uncanny ability to make\nalmost any audio source sound deliciously Hi-Fi, and they pair it with Sony\u2019s\nactive noise-canceling circuitry, for whisper-quiet backgrounds on airplanes,\npublic transit, or even noisy offices. Battery life is impressive at six hours\nper charge, but if you switch off noise-cancellation, that jumps to a killer\neight hours. The Duracell-like charging case stores three full charges, giving\nyou up to 32 hours of playtime \u2014 or 24 if you like your environment ultra-\nquiet.\n\nSony\u2019s app for iOS and Android gives you control over EQ, noise-cancellation\nlevels, and other customizations. Our only gripes? There\u2019s no ability to\ncontrol volume levels without reaching for your phone or asking your voice\nassistant, and these earbuds don\u2019t want to be anywhere near moisture. These\nsmall issues notwithstanding, Sony has officially taken the lead when it comes\nto what we can expect from truly wireless earbuds.\n\nSennheiser\u2019s recently released [Momentum True Wireless\n2](https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/sennheiser-momentum-true-\nwireless-2-review/) make for a serious competitor to the Sony\u2019s, with better\nsound quality and comparative active noise cancellation abilities. But, the\nWF-1000XM3 \u2013 or an identically priced alternative like the [Audio-Technica\nATH-ANC300TW](https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/audio-technica-\nath-anc300tw-review/) \u2013 can be had for $70 less, making them the better value\nif you\u2019re searching for great active noise cancellation. If you\u2019re after top-\nnotch sound, however, Sennheiser may be worth a look.\n\n**[Read our in-depth review of the Sony\nWF-1000XM3](https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/sony-\nwf-1000xm3-review/)**\n\n## Best budget wireless headphones: Shure SE112 Wireless\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n**Why you should buy them:** You want a simple pair of in-ear headphones that\nare both streamlined and more affordable than other models of similar quality.\n\n**Who\u2019s it for** : The discerning shopper looking for a pair of quality in-\nears.\n\n**Why we picked the** **Shure SE112 Wireless** **:**\n\nIn an age where earbuds have largely replaced over-ear and on-ear headphones\nas the average commuter\u2019s listening device of choice, it\u2019s scarily easy to\nfind some really bad in-ear headphones. Scores of models line store shelves\nand cost anywhere from $10 to $20. Unfortunately, as with most material things\nin life, you get what you pay for. The reality is that while their price might\nnot immediately read as \u201cbudget,\u201d in the world of high-quality in-ears, the\nShure SE112 Wireless are a steal.\n\nWhen [we reviewed the SE112\u2019s wired\nversion](https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/shure-se112-review/),\nwe were pleased to find them to be an affordable pair of in-ears with high-\nperformance quality \u2014 this is Shure after all, and the company has been a top\nname in audio for decades for a reason. We were also impressed with several\nother aspects of the Shure SE112, including the excellent passive sound\nisolation and great design and construction.\n\nThe wireless model, naturally, adds the benefit of unfettered connection via\nBluetooth to the already stellar sound and build quality. But there\u2019s more.\nThe wired version of the Shure SE112 lacked an inline mic for phone calls, but\nthis has been rectified with the SE112 Wireless. An inline mic and remote sit\non the right-hand side, making them even more of an upgrade over their wired\npredecessors. Their eight hours of battery life isn\u2019t a ton, but it\u2019s enough\nfor a full day of listening, and that\u2019s good enough at this price.\n\nWhile you _could_ buy wireless in-ears for less, these are the best budget in-\nears you _should_ buy.\n\n**[Read our in-depth Shure SE112 Wireless\nreview](https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/shure-se112-review/)**\n\n## The best wireless headphone for running: JLab Epic Air Sport\n\n![JLab Epic Air Sport\nReview](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)Riley\nYoung/Digital Trends\n\n**Why you should buy them:** They\u2019re durable, and have some of the best\nbattery life you\u2019ll find.\n\n**Who they\u2019re for:** People who want the best water protection, battery life,\nand fit.\n\n**Why we picked the JLab Epic Air Sport:**\n\nThere are no better workout companions than the JLab Epic Air Sport. The bulky\npair of headphones isn\u2019t winning any design awards, but you\u2019re not in the gym\nlooking to win beauty pageants. All their other features, however, make them\nperfect for sweaty sessions, and at a considerably lower price point than\ntheir closest competitors.\n\nThe ear hooks are killer, helping them stay on your ears during intense bursts\nof jogging or perhaps a round of CrossFit. Helping the comfortability and\nsecurity, JLab throws in a glutton of eartip options, including four sizes of\nsilicon tips, foam ones for added noise reduction, and multi-layered tips for\nless cooperative ear canals.\n\nWith ten hours of battery life, the Epic Air Sport last long enough for any\nworkout session and offer some of the best battery life in wireless earbuds,\nperiod. You\u2019ll get another 60 hours on the go thanks to the 2,600mAh battery\ninside the charging case, which can also charge your smartphone.\n\nThe cost of all these features is size. They\u2019re not at all petite, but if\nyou\u2019re buying these primarily for workout sessions, who cares? The Epic Air\nSport push the bar on durability, too, offering an IP66 rating for water and\ndust resistance. They\u2019ll withstand any amount of sweat and rain you can throw\nat them.\n\nAn ambient audio mode keeps you safe on the street by piping in surrounding\nnoise so you can listen out for important cues in the world around you. To top\nall that off, JLab took care to ensure they sound excellent. In our review, we\nfound the Epic Air Sport to be well-balanced, and with three preset EQ modes\nshaping the soundstage to fit a variety of genres \u2014 easily adjustable with\ncapacitive touch controls \u2014 they could very well serve as your daily drivers.\n\n**[Read our in-depth JLab Epic Air Sport\nreview](https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/jlab-epic-air-sport-\nreview/)**\n\n## The best wireless headphones for calls: Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones\n700\n\n![Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700\nreview](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)Julian\nChokkattu/Digital Trends\n\n**Why you should buy them:** The Bose Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones 700\nshine in voice performance, making them the go-to companion for frequent\ncallers and flyers.\n\n**Who they\u2019re for** : Those who need excellent and reliable call quality\nwithout sacrificing musical fidelity\n\n**Why we picked the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700:**\n\nWhile the Sony WH-1000XM3 are our favorite pair of full-sized wireless cans\nfor music, Bose steps in for calls with its Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 \u2014\nwhich we\u2019ll just call the Bose 700 from here on out. These are ideal for the\nindividual who switches between tunes and talk often. In testing, we found\nthat the microphone on Bose 700 consistently matched, and sometimes\noutclassed, the one built into the phone. Get ready for productive calls as\nthose on the other end won\u2019t have to devote precious brainpower deciphering\ngarbled dialog.\n\nPerfect for business users, the Bose 700 boast excellent noise cancellation,\nwhich helps those noisy rides in a car or airplane. They don\u2019t measure up to\nthe aforementioned Sony pair in that regard, but they come very close, and the\nrich audio performance helps drown out anything that might otherwise penetrate\nthe soundstage. Although its overall design offers less ergonomic flexibility\ncompared to the company\u2019s highly refined QuietComfort II model, Bose\u2019s\nsignature comfort is in full force here thanks to soft padding for the cups\nand headband and good weight distribution.\n\nThe Bose 700\u2019s controls are convenient, with three tactile buttons combining\nwith a touch interface to give you one-touch access to volume and playback\nfunctions. One of those buttons allows you to adjust the noise-canceling\nintensity on a scale from zero to ten, or outright disable the feature\naltogether. There\u2019s also a button dedicated to calling up your favorite\nvirtual assistant.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to go as long as 20 hours when noise cancelation is engaged,\nand that runtime doubles to 40 hours with it off. Even if you\u2019re an unusually\nheavy listener, a 15-minute charge with the included USB-C cable can get you\ntwo extra hours, so you should never feel the need to stay tethered.\n\n**[Read our in-depth Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700\nreview](https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/bose-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones-700-review/)**\n\n## The best wireless headphones for iPhone: Apple AirPods Pro\n\n![Apple AirPods\nPro](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n**Why you should buy them:** They\u2019re a huge step-up from Apple\u2019s AirPods, with\nbetter sound, better fit, and excellent noise cancellation.\n\n**Who they\u2019re for** : Apple users who want the best true wireless earbud\nexperience.\n\n**Why we picked the Apple AirPods Pro:**\n\nApple\u2019s AirPods have managed to become the most popular true wireless earbuds\non the planet despite lacking some features we\u2019ve started to expect, like\ngreat sound quality, a secure fit, and IPX4 sweat-proofing.\n\nGiven that the new AirPods Pro address all of these concerns, and then add\nsuperb noise cancellation on top, it\u2019s easy to see why they are now the best\noption in a set of true wireless earbuds for Apple users.\n\nGranted, at $250 the AirPods Pro aren\u2019t going to help much in the\naffordability department, but at only $50 more than the AirPods with a\nwireless charging case, they offer a ton of value for their higher price.\n\nThe in-ear design of the AirPods Pro provide a stable and secure fit, thanks\nto the three sizes of silicone ear tips that come in the box, and this noise-\nisolating shape is a big reason why they sound so much better than the regular\nAirPods. However, Apple\u2019s adaptive EQ likely plays a role too: It adjusts to\neach person\u2019s ear shape.\n\nBattery life is unchanged at just 5 hours of playtime and 24 hours total with\nthe wireless charging case, but the first time you try the AirPods Pro\u2019s\nnoise-canceling feature we suspect you\u2019ll be too amazed to worry much about\nthe battery.\n\n**[Read our in-depth Apple AirPods Pro\nreview](https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/apple-airpods-pro-\nreview/)**\n\n## The best wireless headphones for Android: Google Pixel Buds 2\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)Nick\nWoodard/Digital Trends\n\n**Why you should buy them:** It\u2019s hard to beat the combination of features,\ncomfort, and quality that the Google Pixel Buds 2 bring to the table.\n\n**Who they\u2019re for** : Those who are already invested in the Android ecosystem\nand looking for earbuds designed to fit right in.\n\n**Why we picked the Google Pixel Buds 2:**\n\nThere\u2019s been plenty of earbuds vying to be what can best be described as the\n\u201cAirPods of the Android world.\u201d Some, like the Amazon Echo Buds and Samsung\nGalaxy Buds+, have done well. But no product has brought it down to a science\nquite like the Google Pixel Buds 2.\n\nGoogle\u2019s second generation Pixel Buds come equipped with an array of Android-\nspecific features, starting with a Fast Pair on Android feature that\nstreamlines pairing the buds with your Pixel or Android smartphone. They\u2019re\nalso the first Google Assistant hot word enabled earbuds, meaning you can make\nvoice commands just by saying \u201chey Google\u201d or \u201cOK Google\u201d out loud. Toss in\nother stellar features, like the return of Google Translate, and these Pixel\nBuds certainly seem like the real deal for Android owners.\n\nWhile they only have average battery life, the Pixel Buds 2 have exceptional\nsound quality and a retooled design that fits near-flush in your ear. Add in\nthose rock solid features, and it\u2019s evident that Google has created the best\nbuds for Android users yet.\n\n**[Read our in-depth Google Pixel Buds 2\nreview](https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/google-pixel-\nbuds-2-hands-on-review/)**\n\n### The best headphones for gaming: Astro A50 headset\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n**Why you should buy them:** The Astro A50 headset lives up to its audiophile-\ngrade promise, and then some.\n\n**Who they\u2019re for** : Gamers after the best wireless headset available.\n\n**Why we picked the Astro A50:**\n\nWe take our gaming recommendations seriously around here, and we\u2019re happy to\nconfirm that the A50 nails all the feature points you\u2019d expect from a high-\nquality headset: Powerful audio performance, excellent battery life, and a\ngreat mic with clear voice capture. Plus, it\u2019s stocked with a handful of other\nfeatures that complement its powerful specs and help it stand out from its\nnumerous competitors.\n\nStarting with the audio quality, the Astro A50 is a wireless upgrade from A40,\nbut with all the audiophile-grade sound of its corded sibling preserved thanks\nto 5.8GHz wireless connectivity for low-latency sonic delivery.\n\nThe A50 makes every game we\u2019ve played with this headset on our ears more\nengrossing and entertaining. Not only does it live up to Astro\u2019s claims of\naudiophile-grade sound, but the A50 is also a powerful headset that pushes\nsome seriously big sound. The only aspect of the sound quality that we didn\u2019t\nlike was a bit too much brightness in the high-end. Theoretically, the\nincluded EQ switcher should have helped this, but we found the feature\nlacking. Still, even with that minor complaint, there is no doubt the A50 is\none of the best-sounding wireless headsets out there.\n\nOther features \u2014 auto-shutoff, hassle-free wireless connection, and long\nbattery life \u2014 make this headset excellent for long hours of play time, while\nthe A50\u2019s mic will outperform whatever flimsy pack-in mic your console came\nwith. We had a blast testing the Astro A50, and we have no reservations in\nsaying this headset should be the go-to option for both serious gamers and\naudiophiles alike.\n\n**[Read our in-depth Astro A50 review](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gadget-\nreviews/astro-a50-review/)**\n\n### The best headphones for kids: Puro PuroQuiet\n\n![Puro Sound Labs BT2200\nreview](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)Bill\nRoberson/Digital Trends\n\n**Why you should buy them:** The PuroQuiet are designed to keep children\u2019s\nears happy and safe.\n\n**Who they\u2019re for** : Parents who want the peace of mind knowing their\nchildren\u2019s hearing is protected.\n\n**Why we picked the PuroQuiet:**\n\nWhen we say \u201cbest wireless headphones for kids,\u201d we aren\u2019t talking about the\ncutest or most colorful \u2014 though we could see a case being made for the\nPuroQuiet being referred to as such. Instead what we mean is the _safest_\nheadphones for kids. As reviewers of audio equipment, hearing damage and loss\nranks pretty high on our list of fears, so we can empathize with parents\nlooking for the safest pair for their kids (we\u2019re actually turning down our\nheadphones as we write these words.) In this department, the PuroQuiet can\u2019t\nbe beaten.\n\nThe PuroQuiet are noise-canceling headphones designed for kids that come with\na hard volume limit to prevent your child\u2019s tiny ears from getting damaged.\n\nDespite children\u2019s products being stereotyped as low-quality junk (rightfully\nso, in many cases), Puro hasn\u2019t cut corners on the PuroQuiet, which punch well\nabove their weight when it comes to looks and build quality. The headphones\nfeature rectangular-shaped earcups that are made out of robust metal and come\nin vibrant colors like electric blue or bright pink. They\u2019re blocky and\ncolorful, as kid stuff often is, but don\u2019t look or feel \u201cchildish,\u201d if that\nmakes sense.\n\nThey also strike a balance between comfort and design, with a plush, round\nheadband coated in soft imitation leather. Even the adjustment section of the\nheadband, which is also metal, feels solid and strong. Parents can feel\ncomfortable letting their kids wear these, and the headphones are durable\nenough to take a beating, too.\n\nHowever, the standout feature here is the PuroQuiet headphones\u2019 custom, built-\nin software limiter. It\u2019s designed to keep music below 85 decibels, while\nmaintaining a balanced sound signature. This means that your budding\naudiophile can crank them all the way up, and you\u2019ll still never have to worry\nabout them blasting their ears out. And thanks to 16 hours of battery life,\nyour kids can listen for as long as they (by which we mean you) want.\n\n**[Read our in-depth PuroQuiet review](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-\ntheater/puro-kids-noise-canceling-headphones-impressions/)**\n\n### The best wireless headphones for sound quality: Sennheiser Momentum 3\n\n![Sennheiser Momentum\n3](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n**Why you should buy them:** For the money, there are no better-sounding\nwireless headphones out there.\n\n**Who they\u2019re for** : Avid audiophiles who want to go wireless.\n\n**Why we picked the Sennheiser Momentum 3:**\n\nFollowers of this round up will no doubt wonder why the Sennheiser Momentum 3\nhave taken the place of our previous pick for this category, the [Master and\nDynamic MW65](https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/master-and-\ndynamic-mw65-review/). The answer comes down to price. We still adore the MW65\nfor their incredible wireless sound quality, which we still believe is the\nbest you\u2019ll find. But the Sennheiser Momentum 3 come so close \u2014 yet they cost\naround $100 less \u2014 it makes them the better overall value.\n\nWhen our reviewers spent time with the Momentum 3, it was clear that\nSennheiser hadn\u2019t wavered one bit from its commitment to top-notch sound. The\nwireless cans manage to \u201cachieve both energy and accuracy in a way that we\u2019ve\nrarely experienced from wireless headphones before,\u201d with modern rock music\nbeing an especially strong genre. Female vocals, in particular, stand out from\nthe mix and are given just the right amount of precision and crispness,\nwithout suffering from any harshness.\n\nNoise-cancellation, though not quite as good as the Bose or Sonys, will still\nsatisfy most listeners in typical environments like coffee shops and public\ntransit. Call quality is also excellent thanks to Sennheiser\u2019s judicious\nplacement of mics on the earcups.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s more to the Momentum 3 than just sound quality. In our\nopinion, they\u2019re some of the best looking headphones on the market. The clean,\nbare-bones design has a slightly retro vibe, yet the choice of materials make\nit clear these are state of the art. Their physical buttons instead of touch\ncontrols make them a snap to figure out and use, and Sennheiser\u2019s companion\napp for iOS and Android let you tweak things like EQ to your heart\u2019s content.\n\nIntegrated Tile tracking is a bonus: No more where-the-heck-did-I-leave-my-\nheadphones as you try to get out the door in the morning.\n\nAre they perfect? No \u2014 we have some minor quibbles when it comes to battery\nlife, which at just 17 hours is only just OK, and we wish the headband had\njust a bit more padding. The lack of a hard case and the Momentum 3\u2019s one-way\nfolding design means that they\u2019re not going to be as good for frequent\ntravelers as some of our other picks.\n\nThat said, if you\u2019re looking for sublime sound in a set of wireless\nheadphones, the Sennheiser Momentum 3 check all of the right boxes and even\nsave you some money over pricier models.\n\n**[Read our in-depth Sennheiser Momentum 3\nreview](https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/sennheiser-momentum-\nwireless-3-review/)**\n\n## Research and buying tips\n\n  * Are Airpods the best wireless headphones?\n  * [Do wireless headphones work well for TV?](http://fortv)\n  * Can I make calls with wireless headphones? \n  * Are any wireless headphones sweatproof? \n  * How durable are wireless headphones? \n  * How long do wireless headphone batteries last? \n  * Are wireless or wired headphones better? \n\n**Are Airpods the best wireless headphones?**\n\nWhile this is obviously subjective, our answer is no. The latest AirPods have\nmiddling battery life, mediocre sound, and are missing features we expect to\nsee in top wireless earbuds, including waterproofing and features like ambient\nawareness mode. That said, Apple\u2019s new AirPods Pro are a revelation and\naddress every single critique of the AirPods except battery life. We\u2019re not\nready to say the AirPods Pro are the best either, but they make a very strong\nargument for that title.\n\n**Do wireless headphones work well for TV?**\n\nGenerally, only with TVs that output Bluetooth audio, many of which do not.\nOtherwise, you\u2019ll usually need an adapter or select soundbars with Bluetooth\ntransmission.\n\n**Can I make calls with wireless headphones?**\n\nAs long as they have a built-in microphone, which the vast majority do, you\ncan make calls with your wireless headphones.\n\n**Are any wireless headphones sweatproof?**\n\nYes, if they have an [IPX rating](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-\ntheater/what-is-ip-water-resistance-headphones-speakers/) for water or sweat\nresistance.\n\n**How durable are wireless headphones?**\n\nThis depends heavily upon the make and model.\n\n**How long do wireless headphone batteries last?**\n\nThis depends on many factors, but batteries last anywhere from 3 to 36 hours\nor more per charge. Expect battery life on the lower end of that scale for\nwireless earbuds, while full-sized over-ear headphones typically last much\nlonger. A bigger question is, how long will those rechargeable batteries\ncontinue to hold a full charge? As we\u2019ve [seen with Apple\u2019s\nAirPods](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/the-big-problem-with-tiny-\nearbuds/), the answer isn\u2019t always great.\n\n**Are wireless or wired headphones better?**\n\nWired headphones will almost always offer better fidelity, longevity, and\ndurability. For most use cases, though, wireless headphones offer\nsignificantly more convenience.\n\n## **How we test**\n\nWe test headphones and earbuds the way normal people live.\n\nWe run every pair of headphones through a rigorous process over several days.\nThat includes playing them in all sorts of scenarios \u2014 be it on a bus, in the\nlistening room, or at the office \u2014 and playing back from a wide array of\nsources. We know most people use their headphones with a smartphone, often\nwith lower quality MP3 resolution tracks, so we do, too.\n\nHowever, we also move up to high-resolution audio files, as well as a wide\nvariety of sources, including plugging in directly to a PC or Mac, using USB\nDACs (digital-to-analog converters), and employing high-quality dedicated\nportable players and amplifiers.
