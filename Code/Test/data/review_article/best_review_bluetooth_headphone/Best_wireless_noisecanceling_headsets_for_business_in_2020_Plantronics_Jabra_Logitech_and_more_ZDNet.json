Combine these difficulties with an increasingly\ndigital world, remote customer assistance services and online conversations\nmade through Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and remote conferencing\napplications, and businesses benefit from headsets that take away the\ndistractions and make their staff able to clearly understand and communicate\nwith clients or other employees.\n\nThere are many business advantages to products on offer, whether you are\nlooking for the benefit of wireless headphone options, voice-activated\ncontrols, choosing between active and passive noise cancelation, or if you are\nlooking for budget-conscious but reliable options to equip full teams of\nstaff. Below, you can view our top recommendations for business-ready\nheadsets, whether you are an office worker, working in an open-plan space, you\nwish to dampen out the noise around you on the road, or need to equip a team\nof agents to handle customer communication without distraction.\n\n ** _Disclosure:_** _ZDNet may earn an affiliate commission from some of the\nproducts featured on this page.
