Some broadcast\ncrystal-clear voice, others stream high-quality music and audio in general,\nsome come with noise-canceling capabilities and others have voice-recognition\nfeatures. But what makes a device the best Bluetooth headset, really? The\nshort answer is, whatever works best for you and your needs. The ambiguous\none? A lot of things \u2013 but we cover every single one in our buying guide.\n\nHere, we'll talk about everything you need to know when purchasing a Bluetooth\nheadset. From the reasons why you should (or shouldn\u2019t!) use a Bluetooth\nheadset, to the features you should be looking for in every Bluetooth device,\nwe mention every big and small thing you should know. So no matter if you\u2019re\nlooking for basic Bluetooth headsets for phone calls only, or noise-canceling\nheadphones that also produce fantastic audio, our buying guide and FAQ section\nshould be able to help you pick the right product.\n\n![man with bluetooth headset](https://www.carbibles.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/man-with-bluetooth-headset.jpg)\n\n## **Features to Consider When Buying a Bluetooth Headset**\n\nTo purchase the best Bluetooth headset, pay attention to the following\nfeatures and whether or not the Bluetooth earphones you like have them.\n\n  * **Multipoint Pairing**\n\nToday, most electronic devices integrate Bluetooth technology. From\nsmartphones and laptops to tablets and various gadgets, Bluetooth tech has\ntaken over. For this reason, it\u2019s not uncommon to want to link Bluetooth\nheadphones to multiple Bluetooth-enabled devices \u2013 in fact, most people do it\nnowadays as it makes using different gadgets at the same time easier. That\u2019s\nwhy Multipoint Pairing is an irreplaceable feature for folks who use two\nsmartphones \u2013 by allowing your headset to be connected to two different\ndevices, Multipoint Pairing enables you to make calls on either device. A\nparticularly useful feature if you use one phone for work and the other one\nfor pleasure.\n\n  * **Comfortable/Adjustable Fit**\n\nAlthough most people have similar ear sizes and shapes, we all have slightly\ndifferent ears. That\u2019s why your friend\u2019s ultra-comfortable Bluetooth earphone\nmay not be comfortable at all on your ear. Luckily, well-designed Bluetooth\nheadsets will feel snug and comfortable on pretty much all average ear sizes\nand shapes, so it\u2019s not that hard to find a good fit no matter the brand or\nprice. However, if you haven\u2019t had luck with headsets in the past, it\u2019s best\nto pick a device that is customizable or adjustable and allows you to move it\naround to find the best fit. Over-the-head Bluetooth headsets may be the best\nsolution in particularly difficult-to-fit cases.\n\n  * **Good Battery Life**\n\nEven the best Bluetooth headset in the world wouldn\u2019t be worth much if it had\na poor battery life. Look for headsets with solid batteries that promise\nrelatively long battery life \u2013 not too long, though. Why? Manufacturers often\ngrossly overestimate the battery life of their product so it sells better,\nwhich is why it\u2019s not wise to blindly believe whatever the packaging says.\nIt\u2019s a good idea to stick to devices that deliver a solid 5-8 hours of talk\nand music time, as most budget Bluetooth headsets already offer that much (no\nmatter what they claim). Of course, if frequent charging bothers you, it may\nbe better to look for longer-lasting batteries, but do bear in mind that these\ndevices usually cost more.\n\n  * **Newer Bluetooth Versions**\n\nBluetooth version matters \u2013 a lot. Not only are the newer versions compatible\nwith more devices, they\u2019re also faster and more secure. Ideally, you want to\nstick to Bluetooth versions 4.0 and above as they offer additional features\nand improved connectivity and range. Still, there\u2019s nothing wrong with older\nversions, especially if you\u2019re on a tight budget, but do bear in mind that the\nnewer the Bluetooth version, the better your headset will play with your other\ndevices and gadgets.\n\n![bluetooth device](https://www.carbibles.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/bluetooth-device-1.jpg)\n\n## **Why You Should Use Bluetooth Headset**\n\nThere are numerous reasons why you should use a quality Bluetooth headset and\nwe\u2019ll cover the most important ones here, starting from \u2013 of course \u2013 safety.\n\n  * **Safer rides**\n\nIt should go without saying that distracted driving is a recipe for a\ndisaster. And you know what\u2019s the most common cause of distracted driving?\nTalking and texting. This is closely followed by looking at GPS directions and\nfiddling with the music auio system. Luckily, you can eliminate or at least\ngreatly minimize all of these risks for distracted driving by using a quality\nBluetooth headset. A good headset will let you make and take calls either with\na push of a button or by using voice commands. It will also stream your music\nthe way you like and even tell you GPS directions if needed.\n\n  * **No Cables**\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of Bluetooth headsets is the ability to be cable,\ncord and wire-free. This allows for ultimate mobility and freedom, which is\nespecially welcome while you\u2019re driving or exercising. With a wireless\nBluetooth headset on your ear, you don\u2019t have to worry about getting caught\nonto something and ripping the earbuds from your ears, or about those dreaded\nwire knots in your pocket. Cable-free means fuss-free.\n\n  * **Easier managing of multiple gadgets**\n\nWe all own and daily use at least a couple of electronic devices \u2013 laptops,\nsmartphones, tablets, smartwatches, you name it. Although most of these were\ncreated to save us time, energy and effort \u2013 basically, to make out lives\neasier \u2013 juggling several different gadgets at the same time can be difficult.\nThat\u2019s why Bluetooth headsets are a great choice \u2013 with the Multiple Pairing\nfeature, they allow you to connect two devices and use them at the same time.\nUsing one phone for music and pleasure and the other one for business calls?\nNo problem \u2013 a quality Bluetooth headset will connect to both and let you\nswitch between them in a matter of seconds.\n\n  * **Better Focus**\n\nSpeaking of owning and using multiple gadgets, have you noticed you\u2019re less\nfocused on the road ahead of you when you\u2019re on your phone, or fiddling with\nyour music stereo/tablet? It\u2019s no wonder why \u2013 we function best when we\u2019re\nfocused on one thing at a time, which is kind of impossible to do with your\neyes on the road, one hand on the wheel and one on your ear, holding a phone.\nIt\u2019s similar while you\u2019re exercising \u2013 you can\u2019t properly focus on your\ntraining if you\u2019re texting at the same time. With a Bluetooth earpiece on\nthough? A piece of cake \u2013 no more toying with your phone or other electronics\nwhile you\u2019re driving/exercising/working, as you can take calls, listen to\nmusic and even text hands-free (depending on the headset, of course).\n\n## **What About Stereo Bluetooth Headphones?**\n\nThere are two main types of Bluetooth headsets: mono and stereo. To get the\nbest headset for your needs, see which type is better suited for your\nlifestyle and preferences.\n\n  * **Mono Bluetooth Headset**\n\nIf your job requires you to spend a lot of time on the phone with employees,\nco-workers and clients, a good mono Bluetooth device is what you need. These\ntypes of headsets broadcast and produce the clearest voice, meaning\ncommunication is prioritized above all else. Of course, most mono Bluetooth\nheadsets can also stream music for you, read audiobooks, etc. so they\u2019re\ndefinitely multitaskers, however they can never produce high-quality audio\nlike stereo Bluetooth headsets can. These are the typical Bluetooth headsets\nthat you wear on either side of your head (all of the headsets featured on our\nTop 10 list are monos). Because they leave one ear open to the environment,\nmono Bluetooth headphones are perfect for driving and when you have to aware\nof your environment or interact with people.\n\n  * **Stereo Bluetooth Headset**\n\nIf you\u2019re an audiophile who appreciates high-quality sound first and foremost,\nit\u2019s highly likely you prefer listening to music on both of your ears. This is\nalso perfectly natural \u2013 in music, stereo sound is created using two audio\nchannels, right and left, which mimics our ability to hear our surroundings.\nThis is why stereo Bluetooth headsets are better at reproducing music than\nmonos are. However, because they cover both of your ears, they\u2019re anything but\nideal for tasks such as driving, bicycling or jogging in a busy city.\n\nSo which Bluetooth headset type is better for you? This entirely depends on\nyour lifestyle, but, if you\u2019re looking for a good headpiece for when you\u2019re\ndriving or interacting with other people, a mono Bluetooth headset is\ndefinitely a better choice.\n\n## **Best Bluetooth Headset FAQ:**\n\n![headset in use](https://www.carbibles.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/headset-in-use.jpg)\n\n### **Q: How many channels does a Bluetooth headset usually use?**\n\n**A:** Your typical Bluetooth headset (the one you wear on one of your ears)\nuses one audio channel. This means it frees up one ear, allowing interaction\nwith others and awareness of surroundings. Stereo Bluetooth headsets, on the\nother hand, offer two-channel output which is great news for music lovers, but\nnot so great when you have to be aware of your environment or interact with\nothers.\n\n### **Q: What is the data throughput speed of a Bluetooth connection?**\n\n**A:** The speed of data that enters and goes through a Bluetooth connection,\nor throughput, depends on the Bluetooth version of your device \u2013 the newer the\nversion, the faster the data transmission. For example, Bluetooth V2.0\u2019s\noptimum speed is up to 3 Mbits/s, while the Bluetooth V3.0\u2019s optimum speed is\nup to 24 Mbits/s. Newer versions are even faster than this.\n\n### **Q: Are different brands of Bluetooth products compatible with each\nother?**\n\n**A:** Most Bluetooth headsets work with most Bluetooth devices. For example,\na Motorola Bluetooth earpiece will work with an iPhone with no issues, just\nlike it will with pretty much any Android phone. However, there are a few\ncaveats here, and you may be surprised to learn that they have nothing to do\nwith different brands of Bluetooth products but different versions of\nBluetooth.\n\nGenerally speaking, a basic Bluetooth headset is going to work with most\nrecent versions of Bluetooth and even some older ones as they\u2019re usually built\nto be backward-compatible with older phones that use older versions of\nBluetooth. However, phones that are designed to use Bluetooth Smart technology\n(V4.0 and above) may not be compatible with basic, older versions of\nBluetooth. This means that before buying a Bluetooth headset, you should check\nits version and the version your phone and other gadgets use. While this can\nbe a pain, it\u2019s better than ending up with a Bluetooth headset you cannot\nconnect to wanted devices. Saying that, if you use newer electronics which use\nnewer Bluetooth versions, there\u2019s pretty much nothing to worry about \u2013 just\npurchase a headset that also uses newer Bluetooth versions (V4.0 or above) and\nyou\u2019ll be set.\n\n### **Q: What is the range of Bluetooth transmitter/receivers?**\n\n**A:** The transmission range of a Bluetooth device depends on the type of\nclass it falls into. There are three main classes.\n\n  * **Class 1** device has a standard range of approximately 330 feet or 10 meters. This is implemented where the is plenty of power, such as in desktop systems or laptops.\n  * **Class 2** device has a standard range of 33 feet or 10 meters. These are the most common Bluetooth transmitters and where the typical Bluetooth headsets and smartphones fall into.\n  * **Class 3** device\u2019s range is less than 10 meters.\n\n![bluetooth gadget](https://www.carbibles.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/bluetooth-gadget.jpg)\n\n## **Our Top Pick**\n\nAll 10 Bluetooth headsets we reviewed here are solid, quality products. But if\nyou\u2019d like to know which device offers best bang for buck, out of all of\nthese, it would have to be **FOCUSPOWER F10**. This tiny Bluetooth earbud is\nso lightweight and compact that you\u2019ll forget you\u2019re wearing it after a short\nwhile. It\u2019s also water-resistant and supports voice command provided you have\nit on your phone (Siri or Google Voice), which makes it ideal for driving,\nexercising, and so on. Importantly, it uses Bluetooth V4.1 & EDR tech, which\nmakes it compatible with all newer Bluetooth devices, plus it\u2019s pretty fast\nwith a good range. Best of all? It\u2019s one of the most affordable quality\nBluetooth headsets on the market.\n\n### **Sources:**\n\n  1.
