I\u2019m willing to bet that one\nof the most common types of headphones you\u2019ll see are wireless headphones. We\nstill have our doubts when it comes to Bluetooth headphones ([especially\nChris](https://www.soundguys.com/5-reasons-not-to-buy-bluetooth-\nheadphones-12150/)), but it\u2019s hard to deny that\n[Bluetooth](https://www.soundguys.com/ultimate-guide-to-bluetooth-\nheadphones-20019/) has come a long way from when it was first announced. Not\nonly do some of the best wireless headphones sound great, but they also come\nwith a number of useful features.\n\n_Editor\u2019s note: this list was updated on July 10, 2020, to address an FAQ\nabout in-ear options._\n\n## The best wireless headphones are Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT\n\nAudiophiles and audio enthusiasts know [Audio-\nTechnica](https://www.soundguys.com/best-audio-technica-headphones-22314/):\nit\u2019s a prolific premium audio company that\u2019s proven itself time and time again\nin the professional industry. Audio-Technica hits it out of the park with its\nwireless headphone debut.\n\n## Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT\n\n[Full Review](https://www.soundguys.com/audio-technica-ath-m50xbt-\nreview-22327/)\n\nBest All-Around\n\n![](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/audio-technica-\nath-m50xbt-switch-1024x575.jpg)\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\nAudio-Technica ATH-M50xBT\n\n8.6\n\n[](https://tyvm.ly/gZVttGM)\n\nIf you liked the[ ATH-M50x](https://www.soundguys.com/audio-technica-\nath-m50x-592/), you\u2019ll love the M50xBT. It may be cliche to say, but these\nheadphones take everything we love about the wired version and feature it in\nthe wireless version. Save for the newly added playback controls, the\nheadphones are nearly identical to their wired brethren. For better or worse,\nthis means they feature the same synthetic padding, which remains a bit thin.\nThat said, the headband is well reinforced, by its metal frame. Folding the\near cups in and up results in a compact, travel-friendly form, too.\n\n[![Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT frequency response\nchart.](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/audio-technica-\nath-m50xbt-frequency-response-\nchart-1024x672.jpg)](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/03/audio-technica-ath-m50xbt-frequency-response-\nchart.jpg)\n\nAlthough the ATH-M50xBT headphones are a little bass-heavy, it isn\u2019t\noverwhelming.\n\nAudio-Technica stays true to its roots, ensuring that audio quality takes\nprecedence over headline-grabbing gimmicks. While it\u2019s not a flashy set of\nheadphones, it includes the necessities to keep pace with the best of them\nincluding Bluetooth 5 and aptX support.\n\nAdditionally, battery life is excellent; these lasted 31 hours and 12 minutes\non a single charge. If you\u2019re looking for the best wireless headphones that\ncan do it all, the ATH-M50xBT is all you need.\n\n## Who should buy Bluetooth headphones?\n\n[![Focal Listen Wireless review: The headphones \\(olive\\) folded up and\nresting in a bright green shrub.](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/05/Focal_Listen-\nWireless_LK_7-1-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/05/Focal_Listen-Wireless_LK_7-1.jpg)\n\nThe Focal Listen Wireless retail for $299 and are available in three\ncolorways: black, olive, blue, and purple.\n\n  * _[Commuters](https://www.soundguys.com/best-bluetooth-headphones-for-commuting-29238/)._ If you spend a lot of time riding buses and trains, then you probably like to stay occupied with headphones. Well, cutting the cord makes blocking the world out that much easier.\n  * _Office workers_. Let\u2019s say you want a break from your cubicle but don\u2019t want to engage in casual banter. Easy solution: grab a pair of wireless headphones. They notify others that you\u2019re not up for talking without having to explicitly say so.\n  * _Students_. Getting around campus can be a slow, monotonous process. You might as well exercise your mind and learn a thing or two from your [favorite podcast](https://www.soundguys.com/podcast-the-usb-c-trainwreck-18256/) while going from the quad to your English seminar.\n\n## The V-Moda Crossfade 2 Wireless Codex are durable and versatile\n\nThe [V-Moda Crossfade 2 Wireless Codex](https://www.soundguys.com/v-moda-\ncrossfade-2-wireless-codex-18345/) are subject to military-level MIL-STD-810G\nstandards, ensuring durability throughout their lifetime. Aside from being\nsome of the toughest headphones on the market, the Crossfade 2 Codex are\nversatile. [AAC](https://www.soundguys.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-bluetooth-\nheadphones-aac-20296/) and [aptX](https://www.soundguys.com/the-ultimate-\nguide-to-bluetooth-aptx-and-aptx-hd-19914/) codec support in tandem with hi-\nres certified wired listening make these the most durable best wireless\nheadphones for general consumers and audio enthusiasts alike.\n\n## V-Moda Crossfade 2 Codex\n\n[Full Review](https://www.soundguys.com/v-moda-crossfade-2-wireless-\ncodex-18345/)\n\nBest Durability\n\n![](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/07/V-Moda_Crossfade-2-Codex-4-1024x683.jpg)\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   * \n\nV-Moda Crossfade 2 Codex\n\n8.5\n\n[](https://tyvm.ly/9Img)\n\nBeneath the exoskeleton case and steel exterior, the headphones are quite\ncomfortable. Much of the comfort is attributed to excellent headband\narchitecture and supple ear cushions. Be aware, though, you will feel the\nweight of these after listening for about an hour or so.\n\n> Even if the style isn\u2019t for you, the functionality and versatility of these\n> headphones deserves to be lauded.\n\nSuperb audio quality and durability aside, the layout of the controls is worth\nappreciating. Seeing as most\n[circumaural](https://www.soundguys.com/headphones-buying-guide-8290/)\nheadphones feature buttons that rest on the lateral edge of one of the ear\ncups, the V-Moda Codex house the playback and volume controls so that they\u2019re\naligned with the removable shield, thus forming an upside down V-shape. Aside\nfrom looking good, the placement makes the buttons easy to differentiate and\nfind on the ear cup.\n\n**Watch the video review[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se3_e7KN5u8)**\n\n## The Sony WH-1000XM3 are the best noise cancelling headphones\n\nFor the past year this spot was occupied by the [Sony\nWH-1000XM2](https://www.soundguys.com/sony-wh-1000x-m2-review-14304/)\nheadphones, but now they\u2019ve been updated with the newer\n[WH-1000XM3](https://www.soundguys.com/sony-wh-1000xm3-wireless-bluetooth-\nheadphones-review-19824/). It\u2019s no surprise that these reign as one of the\nbest wireless headphones since they aren\u2019t drastically different than their\npredecessor. While the rumor is that the Sony WH-1000XM4 isn\u2019t far off from\nrelease, as of yet there\u2019s nothing that makes us believe they\u2019ll be released\nbefore June. We could be wrong, but that may factor into your decision-making.\n\n## Sony WH-1000XM3\n\n[Full Review](https://www.soundguys.com/sony-wh-1000xm3-wireless-bluetooth-\nheadphones-review-19824/)\n\nBest Active Noise Cancelling\n\n![](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sony-\nwh-1000x-m3-controls-1024x575.jpg)\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\nSony WH-1000XM3\n\n8.8\n\n[](https://tyvm.ly/eYwk)\n\nWith the WH-1000XM3, you get the same design and touch-sensitive ear cups for\nadjusting volume and skipping between tracks. The two big differences between\nthe WH-1000XM2 and its predecessor are that the newer models now have deeper\near cups which should help with isolation, and they charge via [USB\nType-C](https://www.soundguys.com/usb-audio-explained-18563/). The build\nmaterials of the ear cup are also upgraded. Gone is the fake leather of the\nprevious model and instead, you\u2019ll get a smooth plastic.\n\nWhen you use the app, you can also make use of Sony\u2019s 360 Reality Audio, which\nwhen paired with partner streaming services, lets you listen to your music as\nif it were all around you. It\u2019s a brilliant feature, but requires the Sony\nheadphones app to work.\n\n![](//i.ytimg.com/vi/MRviOQl_R4s/hqdefault.jpg)\n\nBattery life is another key aspect of these headphones that got slightly\nbetter. If you pick yourself up a pair of WH-1000XM3 headphones you can expect\na solid 24 hours of constant playback out of them. That\u2019s with active noise\ncancelling turned on as well, so these will have your back even on the longest\nflights. Of course, the main issue that most people will have these is still\nthe price tag, but if you do decide to invest in one of the best wireless\nheadphones, you won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\n**Related:[Sony WH-1000XM3 or Bose QuietComfort 35\nII?](https://www.soundguys.com/sony-wh-1000x-m3-or-bose-qc35-ii-which-to-\nbuy-22275/)**\n\n## The best design goes to the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700\n\nWhile they didn\u2019t dethrone the Sony WH-1000XM3 on our list of best noise\ncancelling headphones, the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700s are still\ngreat. As the next iteration of the ANC line from Bose, these have a brand new\ndesign that makes the QC35s before them seem ancient. The only downside is\nthat you no longer get any folding hinges, but you can still rotate the\nearcups to lie flat and the new metal headband is much more durable.\n\n## Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700\n\n[Full Review](https://www.soundguys.com/bose-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones-700-24897/)\n\nBest design\n\n![](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bose-Noise-\nCancelling-Headphones-700-6-2-1024x576.jpg)\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   * \n\nBose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700\n\n8.5\n\n[](https://geni.us/xX7c8Te)\n\nThe new design isn\u2019t just for looks either. The playback control buttons have\nbeen replaced by a touch-sensitive gesture pad on the right earcup for\ncontrolling your music and the microphones inside have also been redesigned.\nOur testing showed an impressive battery life of 21 hours which should get\nmost people through at least a week of commutes. Then there\u2019s the active noise\ncancelling, which is still one of the best around as is expected with a pair\nof Bose headphones.\n\n## **Looking to save some cash? Get the Anker SoundCore Vortex**\n\nWhen it comes to finding the best wireless headphones, going the inexpensive\nroute may seem counterintuitive. Luckily, Anker specializes in bringing good\nquality products at a lower price point, and the [Anker Soundcore\nVortex](https://www.soundguys.com/anker-soundcore-vortex-review-17679/) is no\ndifferent. They may not have a premium design or be as well-built as some of\nthe other options on this list, but they do have a bunch of great features\nthat hold their own against the big dogs.\n\n## Anker Soundcore Vortex\n\n[Full Review](https://www.soundguys.com/anker-soundcore-vortex-review-17679/)\n\nBang for your Buck\n\n![](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Anker_Soundcore-\nVortex_LK_4-1024x683.jpg)\n\n  *   *   * \n\nAnker Soundcore Vortex\n\n8.1\n\n[](https://tyvm.ly/fkKpr)\n\nFor one, these are compatible with Qualcomm\u2019s aptX codec for streaming in\nhigher quality. They also have large, plush earcups for comfort and hinges to\nhelp them fold down for a smaller footprint when traveling. But the most\nimpressive feature goes to the 20-hour battery life. If you\u2019re not a fan of\nplugging in headphones every night to charge, then these might be for you.\n\n## How we picked the best wireless headphones\n\nChoosing which product is best changes depending on what the category is. If\nyou\u2019re searching for the [best headphones](https://www.soundguys.com/best-\nover-ear-headphones-18379/), we might focus more of our efforts on sound\nquality instead of cool extra features. On the flip side, if you\u2019re looking\nfor the [best waterproof speakers](https://www.soundguys.com/waterproof-\nspeakers-8214/), chances are we\u2019re going to prioritize a strong, durable build\nover something like sound quality.\n\n[![best wireless headphones Edifier W860NB: A hand on the touch panel of the\nheadphones.](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/Edifier_W860NB-9-1024x575.jpg)](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/Edifier_W860NB-9.jpg)\n\nThe Edifier W860NB, although a great set of headphones, couldn\u2019t outperform\nany of the top best wireless headphones picks.\n\nFor this particular list, there were a few things that took priority. First\nwas the Bluetooth connection. In order to be in the running for the best\nwireless headphones, a strong connection was a must. After that came sound\nquality. At the end of the day these are still headphones, and you\u2019re going to\nbe using them to listen to music.\n\nAdditionally, we took user feedback on battery life into account when weeding\nout products from our list. When we were writing our best [Bluetooth\nearbuds](https://www.soundguys.com/best-bluetooth-earbuds-2018-2638/) best\nlist, our readers made it very clear that battery life was the most important\nquality to assess after sound quality and comfort.\n\n> Like\n> [#Bluetooth](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bluetooth?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> [#earbuds](https://twitter.com/hashtag/earbuds?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)?\n> Comfort and sound quality aside, what's the most important thing they can\n> have?\n>\n> \u2014 SoundGuys (@realsoundguys) [October 9,\n> 2017](https://twitter.com/realsoundguys/status/917515928081960961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nBluetooth by itself has a bad rep when it comes to sound quality, but it\u2019s\ncome a long way over the years, so anything on this list had to at the very\nleast sound good. Lastly, some of our decisions were made based on [internal\nobjective testing](https://www.soundguys.com/headphone-reviews-why-we-\ntest-18172/) of the best wireless headphones with special [software and\nmicrophones](https://www.soundguys.com/how-we-test/).\n\n**Related:[Best truly wireless earbud\nheadphones](https://www.soundguys.com/best-truly-wireless-earbuds-14313/)**\n\n## What you should know about the best wireless headphones\n\nThe Sony MDR-1000XM3 have spectacular active noise cancelling, but what is it?\nAnd how does it work? You can [dive deeper](https://www.soundguys.com/how-do-\nnoise-cancelling-headphones-work-12380/) if you\u2019re really curious to learn the\nscience behind it, but if you don\u2019t feel like dusting off your old textbook\nand want the TL;DR version, here it is.\n\nTiny microphones built into the headphones pick up what\u2019s going on around you\nand then play the opposite sound wave into your ear along with your music.\nBecause the sound wave that\u2019s produced by the headphones is basically the\nexact opposite of the one that\u2019s outside of the headphones, it cancels out.\nLeaving you with just the sound of your blissful music. See? That wasn\u2019t so\nbad. Science can be cool.\n\n[![A photo of a man wearing Sony WH-1000XM3\nheadphones.](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sony-\nwh-1000x-m3-wear-1024x575.jpg)](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/10/sony-wh-1000x-m3-wear.jpg)\n\nThe Sony WH-1000XM3\u2019s exterior boasts a soft-touch material.\n\nSo you think you\u2019re ready to understand what makes LDAC or [aptX\nHD](https://www.soundguys.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-bluetooth-aptx-and-aptx-\nhd-19914/) good? Get ready, there\u2019s a ton of technical jargon and numbers\nwe\u2019re about to go over, but we\u2019ll try and keep it relatively short. For a full\nbreakdown make sure to check out [this great\narticle](https://www.soundguys.com/ldac-ultimate-bluetooth-guide-20026/) by\nRob Triggs over at our sister site _Android Authority_.\n\nLDAC is supposed to be better is because it can [carry more audible\ninformation](https://www.soundguys.com/audio-compression-explained-29148/)\nthan the standard SBC [codec](https://www.soundguys.com/understanding-\nbluetooth-codecs-15352/), but our testing revealed that [LDAC isn\u2019t completely\nable to replace a wire](https://www.soundguys.com/ldac-ultimate-bluetooth-\nguide-20026/).

Android 8.0 brings support for\nthese wireless standards to lots of [phones](https://www.soundguys.com/best-\nsmartphones-for-audio-16373/) in the near future and assuming your headphones\nlast longer than your smartphone does: your headphones will only sound better\nas the tech in your phone catches up.\n\n**Related:[Best headphones of 2019](https://www.soundguys.com/best-headphones-\nof-2019-2559/)**\n\n## Test results for the best wireless headphones\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel like diving into each individual review but are still\ninterested in seeing the results for each pair of headphones, check out the\ncharts below.
