We're\ntalking aptX Bluetooth 5.0, the neat Smart Control companion app, physical\ncontrols on the right ear cup and the option to add voice assistant controls\nfrom Siri, Google Assistant or - coming soon - Alexa.\n\nNone of which really account for Sennheiser's position in this list. Because\nthe fact of the matter is you won't get a more thrilling, detailed and poised\nperformance this side of \u00a3350. No matter what you throw at them, the Momentum\nWireless take it in their stride, whether that's driving forward with Childish\nGambino or tackling complex layers of texture and timbre in a spot of\nRadiohead. We can't tell you enough what a confident and balanced listen this\nis, they're fully in charge no matter the tempo or rhythmic idiosyncrasies.\n\nSennheiser pips our long-time favourites from Sony to the top-spot on pure\nsound then. They do cost more than \u00a3100 over the current price of the XM3s\nthough, which are also worth considering if battery life or noise-cancelling\nperformance are more important to you. The noise cancelling, which has three\nlevels, is not the most thorough around but the top 'max' level is fairly\neffective.\n\nAs for battery life, the Sennheiser's will last a respectable, if not\nstunning, 17 hours versus 30+ hours elsewhere. Still, with this sonic\nsignature, we'll take the extra charging.\n\n**Pros:** Energetic, expansive sound; comfortable; good control app  \n**Cons:** So-so battery life; likewise the noise cancelling\n\n#### Read next\n\n  * [The best coffee machines for any budget](/article/best-coffee-machine-home-pods-capsule-espresso-nespresso)\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/Nb19EVxO8KN/crop/200/square/f/wired-recommends-\ncoffee-machine.jpg)\n\n###  The best coffee machines for any budget\n\n* * *\n\nBy WIRED\n\n**Price:** \u00a3290 | **[Check price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Osooep) |\n[Currys](https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/audio-and-\nheadphones/headphones/headphones/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-bluetooth-noise-\ncancelling-headphones-black-10197885-pdt.html) | [John\nLewis](https://www.johnlewis.com/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-0-noise-\ncancelling-bluetooth-over-ear-headphones-with-mic-remote/p4395208) **\n\n### Sony WH-1000XM3\n\n **Superstar noise cancelling and sound at a great price**\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/Jz6mEyG5gKZ/crop/405/f/sony.jpg)\n\n**Type:** Over-ear | **Wireless:** Yes | **Bluetooth:** aptX HD 4.2 |\n**Battery life:** 30hr | **Remote:** n/a | **Finishes:** 2 | **Weight:** 255g\n| **Cable:** 1.2m | **Noise cancelling:** Yes | **Sensitivity:** 104.5dB |\n**Style:** Closed back\n\nYes, we realise more than \u00a3250 for a pair of headphones might stretch your\ncredulity.

And they are\nindeed a massive step-up from the previous generation of Apple buds with a\nmuch welcome redesign, a considerable improvement in sound performance and\ngenuinely cracking noise-cancellation.\n\nMost of what's worth talking about with the AirPods Pro comes down to Apple\nresponding (well) to previous criticism of the AirPods line. The now-iconic\n(yet ridiculous looking) stems are now a full centimetre shorter. The\ncombination of the superb, balanced sound on offer and the very good noise\ncancelling also now makes these the commuter's go-to.\n\nSure, the noise cancelling can't be adjusted and the ear tip test isn't as\nclever as Cupertino thinks but for most people, this overall feature set will\nbe a real winner. With a decent transparency mode, built-in Siri for those who\nwant it and a new squeeze command that's more helpful than the old, hit-and-\nmiss tap controls, we can wholeheartedly recommend the AirPods Pro in a way\nthat we simply haven't been able to with Apple's wireless earbuds before.\n\n#### Read next\n\n  * [We tested all those bed-in-a-box mattresses.

The company has plenty of previous where turning out affordable,\nclass-leading earbuds, and rearranging its brilliant E11s into a wireless\nconfiguration hasn\u2019t spoiled that run of form in the slightest. Quite the\nopposite, in fact.\n\nThe E11BTs sound more accomplished than they have any right to.

Then you need to consider\n**[AKG\u2019s N700 NCM2 headphones (\u00a3199)](https://www.samsung.com/uk/mobile-\naccessories/wireless-akg-headphones-n700ncm2/)** \\- they\u2019ve got almost\neverything you want in a package that doesn\u2019t double the width of your head.\n\nThe looks are good and mercifully discreet; the feel is great thanks to sturdy\nplastics, steel accents and soft, comfy pleather; the finish is robust.\nThere\u2019s active noise-cancelling on board (although it\u2019s nothing like as\neffective as found on some massive alternatives from Bose, Microsoft and\nSony), and reliable, responsive voice control. They\u2019ve a nice control app with\nsome worthwhile EQ functions, Bluetooth 4.2 wireless connectivity and between\n23 and 32 hours of use from a single charge (depending on how many features\nyou\u2019re using at once). Unlike bigger, slightly pricier alternatives, though,\nthere are no touch controls.\n\nWhat really swings it for the AKGs is sound quality. They\u2019re a big-boned and\nexpansive listen, with more than enough low frequency presence to trouble your\nsinuses and an extremely deft, detailed midrange. The top of the frequency\nrange is well judged too, and the AKGs knit a song together convincingly -\nthey\u2019re very talented where presenting a tune as a unified whole is concerned.\n\n**  \nPros:** Compact and robust; rock-solid connectivity; big, punchy sound  \n**Cons:** Humdrum noise-cancelling; no touch controls\n\n**Price:** \u00a3199 | **[Check price on\nSamsung](https://www.samsung.com/uk/mobile-accessories/wireless-akg-\nheadphones-n700ncm2/) | [Argos](https://www.argos.co.uk/product/3110090)**\n\n### Jaybird Vista\n\n **The best for running: Exercise-proof and hard to dislodge**\n\n![](/static/img/tiny.gif) ![](https://wi-\nimages.condecdn.net/image/AAwVXD4RQKe/crop/405/f/wired-wireless-earphone-\nupdates-2.jpg)\n\nJaybird\n\n**Type:** In-ear | **Wireless:** Yes | **Bluetooth:** 5.0 | **Battery life:**\n6hr (10hr from case) | **Remote:** n/a | **Finishes:** 3 | **Weight:** 6g each\n(45g case) | **Water resistance:** IPX7 | **Noise cancelling:** No\n\nCompletely, truly wireless in-ear headphones might seem a counter-intuitive\nchoice for the sporty user. After all, it doesn\u2019t matter how good a headphone\nsounds if it keeps falling out of your ear.\n\nBut despite being a true wireless design, the **[Jaybird Vista\n(\u00a3145)](https://amzn.to/2Me8wfn)** are a downright brilliant choice. Thanks to\ninterchangeable tips and fins (the latter to hold the earbuds steady in your\near) they\u2019re easy to get comfortable and hard to dislodge. And thanks to some\nvery sympathetic tuning and adjustable EQs in the Jaybird control app, they\nsound really good. By which we mean thoroughly punchy, perky and engaging even\nwhen the blood is pumping in your ears.\n\nWaterproof and sweatproof, with six hours of battery life (plus another ten\nfrom the charging carry-case), they\u2019re ready to come along on even the most\noptimistic workout. And thanks to quick charge that means five minutes plugged\nin will get you another hour of running, they\u2019re a welcome addition to your\nfitness regime.\n\n##### Advertisement\n\n**Pros:** Punchy sound; secure fit; sweat resistant  \n**Cons:** Battery life so-so; no extra sports features\n\n**Price:** \u00a3145 | **[Check price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Me8wfn) | [John\nLewis](https://www.johnlewis.com/jaybird-vista-true-wireless-waterproof-\nbluetooth-in-ear-headphones-with-mic-remote/p4309391) |\n[Currys](https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/audio-and-\nheadphones/headphones/headphones/jaybird-vista-wireless-bluetooth-earphones-\nblack-10202336-pdt.html) **\n\n_Not sure what kind of headphones is right for you?
