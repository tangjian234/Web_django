The problem has shifted from having too few options to too many,\nbut that\u2019s where we come in.\n\nWe\u2019ve compiled this guide to show you the best wireless headphones available\nright now, and help you decide which will fit your needs best. This guide\nhighlights over-ear headphones because their slightly larger size allows them\nto offer a more immersive experience.\n\n### What Are the Best Bluetooth Headphones?\n\nThere are many factors to consider when choosing the best wireless headphones\nfor you; below are the most important ones, which we considered while we were\nresearching this list.\n\n**Bluetooth:** All of the wireless headphones we\u2019re recommending use the\nwireless Bluetooth technology to connect to your devices. Bluetooth is an open\nstandard, which means you can use these headphones with your smartphone\ntablet, or computer regardless of which company makes them.\n\n####  See Also\n\n[ ![best face masks cloth\ncovering](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\n\n#####  These Face Masks Meet the CDC Requirements For Cloth Face Coverings\n\n](https://www.rollingstone.com/product-recommendations/lifestyle/best-face-\nmask-alternative-covering-980192/) [\n\n#####  Bluetooth Headsets Making a Comeback as People Move to Multitask\n\n](https://www.rollingstone.com/product-recommendations/electronics/best-\nbluetooth-headsets-1026549/)\n\n####  See Also\n\n[ ![Justin Bieber appears on CSI: Crime Scene\nInvestigation.](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\n\n#####  The 14 Craziest Musician Acting Cameos\n\n](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/musician-movies-acting-\ncameos-97763/) [\n\n#####  10 Best Country Music Videos of 2019\n\n](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/10-best-country-\nvideos-2019-930595/)\n\n**Weight:** Because headphones fit on, well, your head, it\u2019s important to take\nweight into consideration. Most of our recommendations weigh roughly half of a\npound, which is standard for audiophile over-ear headphones.\n\n**Battery Life:** Like many popular tech accessories, wireless headphones run\non rechargeable batteries, and need to be plugged in regularly to continue\nworking. This can be an inconvenience, so we\u2019ve chosen wireless headphones\nthat get at least 19 hours of battery life per charge.\n\n**Cabled Backup:** All of the wireless headphones in our guide have a 3.5mm\naudio out port, which allows you to connect them to a phone, tablet, computer,\nor airplane media console with a 3.5mm audio cable.\n\n**Active Noise Cancellation:** Most of the wireless headphones we\u2019re\nrecommending support ANC (active noise cancellation) technology, a feature\nthat uses the headphone\u2019s microphones to block out certain frequencies. The\nidea is that by blocking out noise, your music will sound clearer and more\ndetailed. When enabled, ANC can have an impact on battery life, but you always\nhave the option to turn it off when you\u2019re in a quiet area.\n\n### 1\\. Anker Soundcore Life Q20\n\n[![Soundcore Q20](https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/01/Soundcore-Q20.png)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NM3RSRQ?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\nCourtesy Amazon\n\nAmazon\n\nSoundcore, a subsidiary of tech accessory maker Anker, entered the audio gear\ngame a couple of years ago, and has already been making waves. Its Q20\nheadphones are a great example why.\n\nThe headphones are one of two pairs that support Bluetooth 5.0, the latest\nversion of the wireless standard that\u2019s more energy efficient. Soundcore says\nthe headphones can get up to 40 hours of battery life on a single charge. In\nterms of weight, the Q20s come in at 0.58 pounds, which is around the average\nfor this style of headphone.\n\nSoundcore says the headphones\u2019 40mm audio drivers deliver excellent sound.\nThese headphones support the company\u2019s custom BassUp technology, which uses an\nalgorithm to automatically adjust the amount of low-end frequencies you hear.\n\nThe Soundcore Q20s support active noise cancellation and have a 3.5mm audio\nout if the headphones run out of battery. If you\u2019re new to wireless\nheadphones, this fully featured pair is the perfect place to start.\n\n[ Buy: Soundcore Life Q20 $64.99\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NM3RSRQ?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n[ Buy it\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NM3RSRQ?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n### 2\\. JBL LIVE 650BTNC\n\n[![JBL Live 650BTNC](https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/01/JBL-\nLive-650BTNC..jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PVR6SXW?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\nCourtesy JBL\n\nJBL\n\nJBL\u2019s LIVE 650BTNC is one of the newest pairs of wireless headphones in the\nstoried audio maker\u2019s portfolio, and they\u2019re very well-rounded.\n\nThey support Bluetooth 4.2, the second-newest version of the wireless\nstandard, which is fine, but not as energy-efficient. That may be one of the\nreasons why the cups only get 20 hours of battery life per charge when active\nnoise cancellation is turned on. The headphones last up to 30 hours per charge\nwhen this feature is turned off.\n\nJBL says these headphones feature the company\u2019s \u201csignature sound,\u201d and goes on\nto say that comes down to \u201cenhanced bass.\u201d If you prefer a more neutral sound,\nyou can adjust the EQ (equalization) inside the JBL My Headphones app (iOS and\nAndroid).\n\nThese headphones don\u2019t have any built-in smart features, but they do allow you\nto activate your phone\u2019s smart assistant (Siri on iOS, Google Assistant on\nAndroid) by tapping on the right ear cup. That same ear cup is where you\u2019ll\nfind the headphones\u2019 3.5mm audio output, which you can use to connect the\nheadphones to your devices via a cable.\n\nIf you want a great sounding, customizable pair of headphones from a well-\nknown company, these fit the bill.\n\n[ Buy: JBL LIVE 650BTNC $195.95\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PVR6SXW?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n[ Buy it\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PVR6SXW?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n### 3\\. Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H4 (2nd Generation)\n\n[![Bang & Olufsen H4](https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/01/Bang-\nOlufsen-H4.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WSJK793?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\nCourtesy Bang & Olufsen\n\nBang & Olufsen\n\nBang & Olufsen recently updated their H4 headphones, improving the technology\ninside without messing around with their modernist look.\n\nThe headphones support Bluetooth 4.2, the second-most recent version of the\nwireless standard, and get up to 19 hours of battery life on a single charge.\nThe H4s weigh just 0.54 pounds, which makes them tied for the lightest opinion\nin our guide.\n\nOn the technical side, the H4s fall a little short: They\u2019re the only\nheadphones in our guide that don\u2019t support ANC, and they don\u2019t have any smart\nfeatures. Instead, Bang and Olufsen focused on audio quality and aesthetics.\nThe headphones have a modern, minimalist look, but it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside\nthat counts.\n\nBang and Olufsen says these headphones produce \u201cpure,\u201d well-rounded sound. The\nbottom line is you should expect your music to sound clean, rather than\nhearing hard-thumping bass or sizzling treble.\n\nIf you care about looks _and_ audio quality, and don\u2019t require active noise\ncancellation, Bang & Olufsen\u2019s H4 (2nd Generation) are the right pick.\n\n[ Buy: Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H4 (2nd Generation) $300.00\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WSJK793?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n[ Buy it\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WSJK793?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n### 4\\. Shure AONIC 50\n\n[![Shure Aonic 50 ](https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/01/Shure-\nAnoic-50-FI.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084RZSFCX?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&language=en_US)\n\nCourtesy Amazon\n\nAmazon\n\nIf I could only recommend one pair of Bluetooth headphones to people who truly\nwant to replicate the experience of listening to an audiophile speaker system\non the go, it\u2019s Shure\u2019s AONIC 50.\n\nThe company may be best known for its microphones, but the AONIC 50s are its\nfirst foray into consumer headphone territory, and they deliver. I\u2019ve tested\ndozens of headphones over the past four years, and have never heard a better\nsounding pair.\n\nThe headphones support Bluetooth 5.0, the latest version of the wireless\nstandard, and get up to 20 hours of battery life per charge. In my experience,\nShure\u2019s battery claims have been accurate.\n\nThe AONIC 50s have two levels of active noise cancellation (normal and max),\nand 11 levels of environmental (sometimes called transparency) settings. The\nenvironmental modes allow you to let in different amounts of ambient noise, so\nyou can listen to your music in busy places (say, walking on the street), and\nstill hear important sounds like a car honking to alert you to move out of the\nway.\n\nIn terms of audio quality, the ANOIC 50s are virtually peerless. Music,\nwhether it comes from YouTube, Apple Music, my personal collection, or TIDAL\nall sounds fantastic. Music from every era and genre sounds extremely clear,\nwell-balanced, and doesn\u2019t distort at full volume. Music in lossless (CD) or\nhigh resolution (Better-than-CD) quality does sound better, but don\u2019t be\ndiscouraged if your entire music collection is on Spotify.\n\nIn an interview with one of Shure\u2019s engineers, I was told the company tested\nbetween 100 and 200 drivers (the part of a speaker that produces sound), until\nthey were satisfied. The work speaks for itself.\n\nI don\u2019t have many complaints about the AONIC 50s, but there are some mild\nones. First, the headphones can connect to multiple devices at the same time,\nbut you\u2019ll hear a \u201cheadphones disconnected\u201d prompt when it loses connection\nwith any of them. So if you\u2019re listening to music on your smartphone, but the\nheadphones are also paired to your tablet, your listening will be interrupted\nif you walk too far away from the tablet.\n\nSecond, Shure opted to put a 2.5mm audio output on their headphones instead of\nthe 3.5mm one that\u2019s been a standard since the 1980s. The company includes a\n2.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable with the headphones, but if that one breaks you\u2019re\nless likely to have a spare on hand.\n\nThose minor issues aside, I can\u2019t recommend Shure\u2019s AONIC 50 headphones highly\nenough. In my view, the company has set the standard for wireless headphones\ngoing forward.\n\n[ Buy: Shure AONIC 50 $399.00\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084RZSFCX?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\n[ Buy it\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084RZSFCX?tag=rollingston07-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US)\n\nIn This Article: [Gift guide](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/gift-guide/ \"Gift\nguide\"), [Headphones](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/headphones/\n\"Headphones\"), [RS Recommends](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/rs-recommends/\n\"RS Recommends\"), [Samsung](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/samsung/\n\"Samsung\"), [Sony](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/sony/ \"Sony\")\n\nWant more Rolling Stone?
