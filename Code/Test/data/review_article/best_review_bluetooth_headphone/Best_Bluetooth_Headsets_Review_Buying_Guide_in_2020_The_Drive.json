You can connect this earpiece to your laptop, tablet, desktop\ncomputer, Apple device, MP3/MP4 player, or any other Bluetooth-enabled device.\n\n  \n\nWhat makes this earpiece stand out is that it\u2019s easy to quickly put on with\none hand.

The headband is also adjustable\nand has an anti-slip pad to help hold it in place. The microphone rotates 270\ndegrees for full adjustability.\n\n  \n\nUnfortunately, the microphone isn\u2019t as durable as the headband. This can cause\nit to stop working overtime. It also isn\u2019t very good at filtering out unwanted\nsounds.\n\nHonorable Mention\n\n8\n\n### [Foldable Bluetooth Headset, Beartwo](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-\nLightweight-Retractable-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B07FGFNP48/?tag=td-bluetooth-\nheadsets-pcr-20)\n\n[![](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/61KMvqN7yRL._AC_SL1000_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-\nLightweight-Retractable-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B07FGFNP48/?tag=td-bluetooth-\nheadsets-pcr-20)\n\n[Check Latest Price](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Lightweight-Retractable-\nHeadphones-Cancelling/dp/B07FGFNP48/?tag=td-bluetooth-headsets-pcr-20)\n\nIf you travel or work remotely, then this folding Bluetooth headset is ideal.\nIt comes with a handy carrying case to keep your headset safe when not in use.\nThe unit folds into thirds with the two earpieces folding towards the middle.\nIt uses Bluetooth 4.1 technology to connect to any Bluetooth-enabled device.\nIt comes in black, gray, and white.

The earbud components are on wires that extend out and fit into\nyour ears. This alleviates the stress on your head from a headband. This\nheadset provides 300 hours of standby time, 188 hours of talking time, and 16\nhours of music listening time.\n\n  \n\nUnfortunately, the Bluetooth connectivity isn\u2019t the best on this headset. It\nwill struggle to remain connected to a device that\u2019s only a couple of feet\naway. The sound quality also isn\u2019t great, so it\u2019s not ideal for listening to\nmusic. You may also have a \u201cfar away\u201d sound to the other person on your call.\n\nHonorable Mention\n\n9\n\n### [Mpow Bluetooth Headset V5.0 with Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-\nBluetooth-Microphone-Headphones-Canceling/dp/B084P23B6R/?tag=td-bluetooth-\nheadsets-pcr-20)\n\n[![](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/61R-i4X1mVL._AC_SL1280_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-\nBluetooth-Microphone-Headphones-Canceling/dp/B084P23B6R/?tag=td-bluetooth-\nheadsets-pcr-20)\n\n[Check Latest Price](https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Microphone-\nHeadphones-Canceling/dp/B084P23B6R/?tag=td-bluetooth-headsets-pcr-20)\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a full headset, then these are what you\u2019re looking for.\nThey look similar to traditional headphones with a headband and two speakers\nover your ears.

This way, we offer genuine, accurate\nguides to help you find the best picks.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.thedrivemedia.com/trust)\n\n## Benefits of a Bluetooth Headset\n\n  *  **Road safety.** A Bluetooth headset helps you avoid the distraction of using your phone or tuning your stereo while driving. You can focus on the road and take calls at the same time with the help of voice-assist technology. You can also get GPS directions when driving to unfamiliar destinations.\n  *  **Entertainment.** Most Bluetooth headsets will allow you to listen to music from your phone, and the high-end versions will allow you to stream music. A good-quality wireless headset allows you to enjoy some entertainment options in your car without fiddling with the buttons on the stereo or your smartphone. \n  * **Wireless technology.** Most Bluetooth devices don\u2019t have cords that can hinder or limit your movement while driving. That\u2019s a big perk, since you don\u2019t have to worry about adjusting the wire while you are driving or doing something else, such as jogging. \n\n## Types of Bluetooth Headsets\n\n### Mono\n\nA mono Bluetooth headset has one earpiece and a microphone. It\u2019s best for\ncommunication as opposed to entertainment. It typically delivers clear voice\nquality and is lightweight and easy to use. The units have a small profile\nthat\u2019s ideal for outdoor use. You can also use mono headsets to listen to\nmusic, audiobooks, or podcasts if you don\u2019t mind getting the sound on only one\near.\n\n### Stereo\n\nA stereo Bluetooth headset comes with two earpieces with either an in-ear or\nover-ear design. It may also come as a full-size headset with padded ear pads\nand a protruding microphone. Stereo headsets are used for voice calls as well\nas for entertainment. They deliver a well-balanced sound, since both earpieces\nreceive the same sound frequency.\n\n## Top Brands\n\n### Plantronics\n\nPlantronics is a California-based electronics company that was founded in\n1961. The company makes audio products and develops consumer software\npackages. Some of its products include gaming headsets, wireless headphones,\nand some of the best Bluetooth headsets for phones. One of its best-rated\nproducts is the [Plantronics Voyager Bluetooth\nHeadset](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Plantronics-Voyager-Legend-Bluetooth-\nHeadset/32467913?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&adid=22222222227021271333&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=40882632392&wl4=aud-430887228898:pla-78813212312&wl5=9032491&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=online&wl12=32467913&veh=sem&gclid=Cj0KCQjwoub3BRC6ARIsABGhnyaXF3aAfI9gQagQoK0_DbWG1JbMszZTHdIwJ6uAv_iearGZ65WPLM8aAjTTEALw_wcB).\n\n### Jabra\n\nJabra is a communication equipment manufacturer that makes professional and\nconsumer wireless headsets and headphones. The company was founded in 1983 and\nis headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark. Some of its products include fitness-\ntracking sports headphones, call center headsets, wireless earbuds, and noise-\ncanceling headphones. One of its best mobile phone Bluetooth headsets is the\n[Jabra Talk High-Definition Headset](https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Bluetooth-\nDefinition-Hands-Free-Multimedia/dp/B07FMHFM62/?tag=td-bluetooth-headsets-\npcr-20).\n\n### Mpow\n\nMpow is a US-based manufacturer of audio and communication devices that was\nfounded in 2013. Some of its products include gaming headsets, Bluetooth\nspeakers, sports earbuds, stereo headphones, and noise-canceling headphones.\nOne of its best-quality Bluetooth headsets is the [Mpow Pro Bluetooth\nHeadset](https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Microphone-Wireless-\nHeadphones/dp/B00UYL7LIY/?tag=td-bluetooth-headsets-pcr-20).\n\n## Bluetooth Headset Pricing\n\n  *  **Under $50:** Most Bluetooth gadgets within this price range are mono wireless headsets. Most will help you make hands-free calls and will read incoming texts. The units typically offer a talk time that\u2019s less than seven hours and will only last for two years before developing issues with reception. These cheaply priced gadgets are best used for short commutes since most aren\u2019t designed for long-term use.\n  *  **Over $50:** At this price range, you are paying for durability and a headset that allows you to make clear phone calls in noisy environments. The headsets are typically larger and offer more talk time hours. Most have a large, padded ear cushion with superb noise-canceling technology. You will also find great stereo headsets that let you enjoy powerful music playback as you drive. \n\n## Key Features\n\n### Bluetooth Version\n\nThe fastest and most reliable Bluetooth versions are Bluetooth 4.0 and above.\nThese devices are more responsive and better at making and receiving calls.\nThey also allow you to pair with multiple Bluetooth-enabled devices, including\nsmartphones, tablets, laptops, and head units. Prioritize headsets that can\npair with at least two devices at the same time.\n\n### Adjustability\n\nIf you are wearing the headset for a long drive, it should be adjustable and a\ncomfortable fit for both your left and right ear. Most Bluetooth headsets come\nwith earbuds of different sizes since people have different ear shapes and\nsizes. A fully adjustable headset with an ear hook allows you to change the\nposition to get a comfortable fit in case it\u2019s not the right size.\n\n### Battery Life\n\nChoose a headset that offers over five hours of talk time on a single charge\nand an even longer standby battery life. That will be more than enough to get\nyou through your daily commutes or a long drive before you get somewhere you\ncan recharge it.\n\n## Other Considerations\n\n  *  **Noise Cancellation:** It\u2019s a huge perk if the headset features noise-cancellation technology. It helps you make clear phone calls by filtering out the sounds in your environment, such as the wind, loud passengers, and noise from other vehicles.\n  *  **Transmission Range:** The best headsets have a high transmission or operation range of at least 30 feet or more. This allows you to take calls outside your car or engage in other outdoor activities while your phone is charging in your vehicle.\n  *  **Multiple Microphones** : If possible, choose the fancy headsets that have multiple microphones for enhanced call quality. Some gadgets have up to four microphones for better audio quality, and you won\u2019t have to keep on repeating your message when making calls.\n\n## Best Bluetooth Headset Reviews & Recommendations 2020\n\nBest Overall\n\n[Plantronics Voyager Bluetooth\nHeadset](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Plantronics-Voyager-Legend-Bluetooth-\nHeadset/32467913?tag=td-bluetooth-headsets-pcr-20)\n\n[![](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/I/51sc6e37-DL._AC_SL1200_.jpg)](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Plantronics-\nVoyager-Legend-Bluetooth-Headset/32467913?tag=td-bluetooth-headsets-pcr-20)\n\n[Check Latest Price](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Plantronics-Voyager-Legend-\nBluetooth-\nHeadset/32467913?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&adid=22222222227021271333&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=40882632392&wl4=aud-430887228898:pla-78813212312&wl5=9032491&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=online&wl12=32467913&veh=sem&gclid=Cj0KCQjwoub3BRC6ARIsABGhnyaXF3aAfI9gQagQoK0_DbWG1JbMszZTHdIwJ6uAv_iearGZ65WPLM8aAjTTEALw_wcB)\n\nThe Plantronics Voyager is a wireless Bluetooth 3.0 headset with triple mic\ntechnology that reduces background noise to deliver enhanced sound clarity.\nIt\u2019s also designed with smart sensor technology, which can detect when the\nearpiece is on your ear and automatically answer calls.

Most headsets have noise-canceling technology, and you may be blocked out from what\u2019s happening around you. You should at least leave one ear open to maintain awareness of your surroundings.\n  * Do not overcharge the headset. Ensure that you unhook it from the charging plug once the battery is full to avoid damaging the charging system or shortening the battery life. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations on how long you should charge it.\n  * Clean the headset regularly with a damp cloth to remove dust, ear wax, and dead skin cells. You can use a gentle disinfectant to remove microorganisms from the earbuds that can cause ear infections.\n  * Always store the headset in a case when not in use. That helps to prevent dust and moisture from damaging the earpiece.\n  * Disconnect the headset from your phone or any other device after use. Switch it off to preserve the battery life of the headset and the connected device. Also, don\u2019t turn the volume too high when using the earpiece. You may damage the speakers.\n  * The best operating range for a Bluetooth headset is about seven feet from the connected device. At that range, you will get the best sound quality with minimal interference from other Bluetooth devices.\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Q: Does a Bluetooth headset kill the phone\u2019s battery?\n\n **A:** It depends on your phone\u2019s battery life.
