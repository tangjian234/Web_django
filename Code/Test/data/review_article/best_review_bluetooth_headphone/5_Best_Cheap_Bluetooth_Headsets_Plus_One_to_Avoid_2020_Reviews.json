Another drawback is the cable which\nbounces, tangles and rubs on your clothes, causing annoying noises.\n\nAll these nuisances lead many people to shop for a decent\n[Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) headset that allows for\ntotal freedom when making a lot of calls every day or doing multiple tasks.\n\nWe considered some models with prices as low as $30 (and even slightly less)\nto come up with this list of picks.\n\nIf you are on a tight budget, the [**Mpow V4.1 Bluetooth\nHeadset**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075RYTHFN/?tag=wearinear-20) would be\nour top pick.\n\nFor the price and its 5-6 hours talk time, it deserves a closer look. While it\nmight not have the stellar sound quality of higher-priced headsets, it really\ncan\u2019t be beaten for the money.\n\nIn a price range slightly up from that, you start to get into some of the best\n[Bluetooth headsets](https://www.wearableinear.com/best-motorcycle-bluetooth-\nheadsets/) one on the market.\n\nA somewhat more sophisticated model like the **[Plantronics Explorer\n55](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JLXND3Q/?tag=wearinear-20) **delivers the\nkind of quality and features that most consumers are looking for in an\naffordable wireless headset including noise-canceling technology.\n\nIf you are primarily getting picking a [headset for driving and commuting then\ncheck this article out](https://www.wearableinear.com/bluetooth-headsets-\ntruck-drivers/).\n\nConsidering battery life, comfort, fitting, build quality, and call quality,\nhere are **our picks for top budget Bluetooth headsets on the market today.**\n\nContents\n\n  * Best Affordable Bluetooth Headsets\n    * Mpow V4.1 Bluetooth Headset\n    * Plantronics Explorer 55\n    * Plantronics Voyager Edge\n    * Samsung Level U\n    * Other Headsets to Consider:\n    * Samsung HM3300 Inexpensive Bluetooth Headset With Crisp Sound Quality\n    * Bluetooth Headset: An Absolute Necessity\n    * How To Pick A Bluetooth Headset\n\n## Best Affordable Bluetooth Headsets\n\n[![Mpow Bluetooth Headset V4.1+ EDR, Bluetooth Earpiece 6-Hrs Playing Time\nw/Mic Noise Insulation, Bluetooth Headset Single with Case Portable, Car\nBluetooth Headset Mono for Smartphone - Silver](https://i1.wp.com/m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/41Y7K19+zJL.jpg?resize=346%2C346&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082F9QTD7/?tag=wearinear-20\n\"Mpow Bluetooth Headset V4.1+ EDR, Bluetooth Earpiece 6-Hrs Playing Time w/Mic\nNoise Insulation, Bluetooth Headset Single with Case Portable, Car Bluetooth\nHeadset Mono for Smartphone - Silver\")Mpow Bluetooth Headset V4.1+ EDR\n\n### Mpow V4.1 Bluetooth Headset\n\n[**The Mpow\u00ae V4.1 Headset**\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075RYTHFN/?tag=wearinear-20)offers clear and\ndetailed sound for any calls you make.\n\nThis unit can be on stand by for up to an amazing 280 hours and gets 5-6 hours\nfor music or continuous talk. The battery takes just two hours to charge. You\nmay be familiar with the Mpow when it comes to Bluetooth gadgets they also\nmake some very popular earbud models in this same price range.\n\nThe stylish all-black design with a rubber coating with silver-colored accents\nlooks professional and modern. This unit is comfortable, especially for a\nheadset in this affordable price range.\n\nAnother win in the plus column for this Mpow unit is its ability to connect to\ntwo Bluetooth smartphones at the same time for those of you that carry two\ncells (work and personal). This is somewhat of a rare feature for such an\ninexpensive headset.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n  * Impressive and slick design\n  * 280 hrs of standby, up to 6 hrs of talk time.\n  * Good noise isolation, comfortable\n  * Strong battery\n\n**Cons:**\n\n  * Over the ear wearing may not fit right to your ears.\n\n### **Plantronics Explorer 55**\n\n[![Plantronics Explorer 55 Bluetooth Headset - Compatible iPhone, Android\nOther Leading Smartphones - Retail Packaging - Black, New Model\nBlack](https://i2.wp.com/m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/51NSAu4OuTL.jpg?resize=358%2C358&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JLXND3Q/?tag=wearinear-20\n\"Plantronics Explorer 55 Bluetooth Headset - Compatible iPhone, Android Other\nLeading Smartphones - Retail Packaging - Black, New Model Black\")Plantronics\nExplorer 55 Bluetooth Headset\n\n[Plantronics Explorer\n55](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JLXND3Q/?tag=wearinear-20) is one of the most\naffordable headsets that made this list.\n\nThis is another entry in our list from Plantronics. If you are familiar with\n[headsets](https://www.wearableinear.com/category/headsets/), whether\nBluetooth or office wired sets for phones, this is a common name and well-\nknown brand. A go-to for call centers and large companies in part for its wide\nrange of\n\nThis budget earpiece by Plantronics delivers an impressive 11 hours of talk\ntime! It also has some useful functions like \u201c _Deep Sleep_ \u201d mode to save on\nbattery and the ability to pair with two devices at the same time.\n\nAs with any product, especially one in this low price range, there are some\nproblems reported. The lifespan and long term durability of a headset this\ncheap is questionable.\n\nIf you need a budget Bluetooth headset, this offers a decent product for the\nprice but it might not last as long as a higher-end headset. Some users report\nthat it worked fine for months but then started having difficulty pairing with\ntheir smartphone. While this is a legitimate concern, unfortunately, it\u2019s a\nrelatively common issue for Bluetooth devices in this price range.\n\nPros:\n\n  * Very affordable price\n  * Reliable Brand\n  * 11 hours talk time\n  * Deep Sleep battery saving mode\n\nCons:\n\n  * Some problems reported of Bluetooth connection being unstable\n  * Bluetooth version 3.0 (see[ differences between version 3 and 4](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Bluetooth-4-0-3-0-and-2-0))\n\n### Plantronics Voyager Edge\n\n[![Plantronics Voyager Edge Wireless Bluetooth Headset with Charging Case -\nCarbon Black](https://i2.wp.com/m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/313a22VIEiL.jpg?resize=352%2C352&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JLVNF2O/?tag=wearinear-20\n\"Plantronics Voyager Edge Wireless Bluetooth Headset with Charging Case -\nCarbon Black\")Plantronics Voyager Edge Wireless Bluetooth Headset\n\n[**The Voyager Edge\nHeadset**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JLVNF2O/?tag=wearinear-20)\nincorporates Plantronics well known audio technology with improved voice\nclarity using Bluetooth 4.0 and also has wideband audio support.\n\nOne of the coolest features of the Voyager Edge is its completely hands-free\noption. Taking advantage of Plantronics voice recognition technology, you can\njust say \u201cAnswer\u201d or \u201cIgnore\u201d rather than pressing buttons.\n\nThis feature not only adds convenience but also a major safety consideration,\nespecially if you talk and take calls when driving.\n\nThe headset comes with three sizes of ear tips (small, medium, and large) for\nmaximum comfort.\n\nPros:\n\n  * Voice recognition\n  * Includes three sizes of ear tips\n  * Bluetooth 4.0\n  * Wideband audio support.\n\nCons:\n\n  * Buttons are too small for large hands\n  * Some users report problematic Bluetooth connection\n  * The lightweight build feels a little cheap\n\n### **Samsung Level U**\n\n[![Samsung Level U Bluetooth Wireless In-ear Headphones with Microphone, Black\nSapphire](https://i2.wp.com/m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/41qK2wm78UL.jpg?resize=355%2C355&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YA8LFPW/?tag=wearinear-20\n\"Samsung Level U Bluetooth Wireless In-ear Headphones with Microphone, Black\nSapphire\")Samsung Level U Bluetooth Wireless\n\nThis may seem unexpected since it isn\u2019t technically a headset.\n\nHowever, the [**Samsung Level\nU**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YA8LFPW/?tag=wearinear-20) is a popular set\nof Bluetooth earbuds that many users find a perfect substitute for a dedicated\nheadset.\n\nIf you primarily listen to music with the occasional cell phone call, you\nshould consider this option. While the neckband may take a little getting used\nto,[ the around-the-neck style earbuds](https://www.wearableinear.com/5-best-\nbehind-the-neck-bluetooth-headphones-earbuds-in-ear/) are popular and a lot of\nusers report them being more comfortable than a headset clip on their ear for\nlong periods.\n\nIf you are looking for in-ear headphones that have headset functionality,\naround the neck style **Samsung Level U** is a perfect choice.\n\nPros:\n\n  * Battery Life (11 hours talk/10 hours play/ 500 hours standby)\n  * Dual-Mic Noise Reduction\n  * Echo Cancellation for improved sound quality during calls.\n  * \n\nCons:\n\n  * Not a traditional one-sided headset if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after\n\n### **Other Headsets to Consider:**\n\n**Son** **y** **SBH24W**\n\n[![Sony Wireless Stereo Headset SBH24W - Black \\(Japan Domestic Genuine\nProducts\\)](https://i2.wp.com/m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/41ATd4PY2KL.jpg?resize=297%2C297&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075TZM9CY/?tag=wearinear-20\n\"Sony Wireless Stereo Headset SBH24W - Black \\(Japan Domestic Genuine\nProducts\\)\")Sony Wireless Stereo Headset SBH24W\n\nEarbuds are made for music, but mono Bluetooth headsets simply aren\u2019t.\nFortunately, there is a set that can either work as in-ear headphones or a\nBluetooth calling headset. The SBH24 is supported by\n[NFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication), it connects to\nBluetooth by just a couple of taps, and the **Bluetooth range even pairs up to\nan impressive 15 feet.**\n\nIn terms of design, the volume control button is quite small, and hard to\npress.\n\nAside from good call quality, it sounds like some of the [best budget\nearbuds](https://www.wearableinear.com/best-cheap-bluetooth-earbuds-in-ear-\nheadphones/) when listening to music. Bass is present but lacks a bit of and\nimpact. You will, however, hear rich, clear sound at a reasonable level.\n\nMore Stereo Bluetooth headsets (Behind the neck design)\n\n### **Samsung HM3300 Inexpensive Bluetooth Headset With Crisp Sound Quality**\n\n[![Samsung HM3300 Bluetooth Headset in White](https://i0.wp.com/images-na.ssl-\nimages-\namazon.com/images/I/31nZEisiwxL._SL160_.jpg?resize=160%2C160&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009UNGW8M/?tag=wearinear-20\n\"Samsung HM3300 Bluetooth Headset \\(White\\)\")Samsung HM3300\n\nThe Samsung HM300 offers 3 different sizes of earbuds which gives you a better\nfit than other headsets like the Plantronics M55. Some users don\u2019t like the\nearhooks which are worn over the ears. Even though the earhooks are flexible\nenough for a custom fit, they sometimes loosen up. **The call quality is\nimpressive, offering consistent, crisp and clear audio at all times.**\n\nDespite not being able to make voice command prompts or an app to sync to,\nthis is still a great Bluetooth headset for the price with a bunch of useful\naccessories.\n\n**Plantronics M55 Refine And Flashy Design**\n\n**Depending on your personal budget you might not consider this necessarily\n\u201ccheap\u201d, however since everyone has a different concept of what\u2019s expensive or\nnot, we did include this one. For the quality features this model is\nrelatively affordable.**\n\n**The Plantronics M55** is a comfortable and lightweight Bluetooth headset. It\nhas a small, simplistic yet flashy design. It is easy to carry anywhere and\nhas features like voice prompts and multi-point tech.\n\nHowever, it works better indoors than outdoors as ambient noises or wind may\nsignificantly interfere with the mic. When used indoors it offers great voice\ncall quality.\n\nThe battery of the M55 wireless headset is strong and efficient. **A built-in\nDeepSleep function will automatically turn the headset off when not in use to\npreserve the battery.**\n\nOne size doesn\u2019t fit all, however, and this headset features just one size of\nearpiece which may fit snugly or loosely in your ear. If this happens to be a\nsnug fit for you, they provide excellent noise isolation. A looped stabilizer\nis soft and adjustable, providing an extra secure fit to ensure the headset\nwon\u2019t fall out.\n\nOne Option to Skip:\n\nSeveral years ago, we looked at lots of _\u201cno-name\u201d_ brands, these were unknown\nbrands (at least to US shoppers) that sold online on sites like Aliexpress,\nAlibaba and other low-cost retailers, many of them that shipped from Asian\n[like this one by\n\u201cHoonshop\u201d](https://honshoop.es.aliexpress.com/store/732627).\n\nAt the time, these $25 headsets (and some even cheaper), seemed like a great\noption. They were so affordable compared to other headsets you\u2019d find in the\nUS at a fraction of the cost. So for someone who just needed a budget headset\nthat would pick up a call and give decent connection while they commuted to\nwork these were a decent solution.\n\nHowever, in recent years the cost of Bluetooth technology has come down and\nthere are many affordable headsets flooding the market. With so many quality\nwireless headsets now available, including several name brands (Plantronics,\nSamsung, Sony) at very reasonable prices, we no longer recommend going for\nthese cheap options. While you may save a few bucks, for us personally we\ndon\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the hassle and international shipping \u2013 especially if\nsomething goes wrong with the set and you have to deal with trying to get a\nrefund or replacement.\n\nEither of the first two options we described above seems like a no-brainer\ncompared to this outer route.\n\n### **Bluetooth Headset: An Absolute Necessity**\n\nIf you often chat on the go, wired headsets are not always the best option and\nwould lead you to look for an alternative without a cable. **Bluetooth\nheadsets are gaining popularity from consumers and manufacturers \u2013 most\ndevices today are made with built-in Bluetooth hardware.**\n\n**Types of Bluetooth Headsets**\n\n[Bluetooth headsets](https://www.wearableinear.com/best-cheap-bluetooth-\nheadset-2016/) have been integrated with a lot of great features like noise\ncancellation, voice command prompts, application syndication, and much more.\nBased on the sound channel they can be divided into two main categories: **m**\n**ono and stereo Bluetooth headsets.**\n\n**Mono Bluetooth Headset:** While keeping your left ear free, a mono headset\nis worn on the right ear only.\n\n**Stereo Bluetooth Headset** : These have 2 earbuds that are connected to a\nbase, neckband ([LG Tone Infinim HBS-900\nWireless](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NW2JBYO/?wearinear-20) headset), or just\na short cable. The controls can be inline or on the right earbuds.\n\n### **How To Pick A Bluetooth Headset**\n\nBefore shopping for a wireless headset there are five factors you should be\ninterested in: battery life, design, size, functionality, and prices.\n\nRemember to consider what your main use for it will be whether that is VoIP\ncalls, personal computer audio, or music. Also keep in mind where you will use\nyour headset: in a noisy office, quiet room, car or cafe. For some, fitting is\nthe most important factor when deciding a headset should be secure and fit\ncomfortably for long periods of time. Additionally, audio quality needs to be\ngood enough to hear callers in any situation. The battery life of Bluetooth\nheadsets varies, ranging from 4 to 6 hours, and the high-end model usually\nlast longer.\n\n**Battery life**. Bluetooth headsets should last for at least 5 hours of talk\ntime. To measure the battery life, after the headset has been connected with\nour host phone via Bluetooth, it will continuously stream audio.\n\n[![Bose Bluetooth Headset Series 2 - Right Ear](https://i0.wp.com/m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/41YVW4u4hkL.jpg?resize=308%2C264&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005LISQ0W/?tag=wearinear-20\n\"Bose Bluetooth Headset Series 2 - Right Ear\")Bose Bluetooth Headset Series 2\n\nPlantronics produced some of the best Bluetooth headsets, with high-end models\nlike [Plantronics Voyager\nEdge](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JLVNF2O/?tag=wearinear-20) and [Voyager\nLegend UC B235-M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009ZJ3MSY/?tag=wearinear-20)\nwhich are very popular among professional users who frequently have business\ncalls, work at a call center or in a customer support department. For\nsmartphone users, the [Bose Series\n2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005LISQ0W/?tag=wearinear-20) is the most\nexpensive headset and has excellent sound and noise-canceling functions.\n\nIf you are a music lover, look for a Bluetooth headset that can enable you to\nenjoy stereo sound and decent call quality. This type of personal gadget is a\nfavorite among office workers who want music along with call functions. Most\nstereo headsets come with a band that rests on your neck.\n\n**Legal issues:** In some states (for example in\n[Florida](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2012/316.304)), you are not\nallowed to wear headphones or other audio devices while operating a vehicle.\nIn most cases, you are required to wear headsets if you want to talk on the\nphone while driving. Whether or not your state has laws requiring hands-free\ncalling while driving, Bluetooth headsets are the safest choice while driving.\n\nHere we\u2019ve rounded up the best wireless headsets on the market.
