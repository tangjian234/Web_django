Quality has\nbeen steadily improving and the gap between Bluetooth and wireless headphones\nhas closed significantly.\n\nWith so much choice, picking the right Bluetooth headphones can be tough.\nThere are hundreds of different models available, from compact in-ear\nheadphones for sport and exercise to larger on- and over-ear headphones that\nprovide additional features such as longer battery life and improved noise\ncancellation.\n\nBelow, you'll find our pick of the best in three simple categories: best over-\near, best on-ear and best in-ear Bluetooth headphones. If you're not sure\nwhich is for you, read our buyer's guide below. If you want to get into the\ndetails, scroll past the guide and you'll find the reviews lower down the\npage.\n\n![](https://cdn2.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/files/styles/large/public/2020/04/lindy_bnx_100.jpg?itok=Qc5xrQ_D)\n\n#### [Deal alert: \u00a350 off the Lindy\nBNX-100](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=83015X1536423&url=https%3A//www.lindy.co.uk/audio-\nvideo-c2/bnx-100-wireless-anc-\nheadphones-p2701&xcust=1405124&sref=https%3A//www.expertreviews.co.uk/headphones/1405124/best-\nbluetooth-headphones-the-best-wireless-in-ear-on-ear-and-over-ear)\n\nLindy has slashed the price on its fabulous Lindy BNX-100, which are now just\n\u00a370 from the company's website.\n\nLindy.co.uk\n\nWas \u00a3120\n\nNow \u00a370\n\n[Buy\nNow](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=83015X1536423&url=https%3A//www.lindy.co.uk/audio-\nvideo-c2/bnx-100-wireless-anc-\nheadphones-p2701&xcust=1405124&sref=https%3A//www.expertreviews.co.uk/headphones/1405124/best-\nbluetooth-headphones-the-best-wireless-in-ear-on-ear-and-over-ear)\n\n### How to pick the best Bluetooth headphones for you\n\n#### What types of Bluetooth headphones are there?\n\nIf convenience is your number-one priority, a set of compact **in-ear\nheadphones** is your best option. These fit inside your ear canal and the\nearpieces can be connected by thin wiring that goes around your neck or a\nthicker neckband (neckbuds). They can even be completely wire-free in the case\nof true wireless earbuds. Given their lightweight these styles of in-ear\nheadphones are typically the best choice for running and other forms of\nexercise. They're also very easily transported, which makes them a great\nchoice for general day-to-day use. The downsides are that they're generally\nless comfortable to wear for longer periods of time and, as they're smaller,\nbattery life often lags behind larger headphones. That battery issue can be\novercome by choosing a pair of true wireless headphones, which typically come\nwith a portable charging case.\n\nSee related\n\n[Best over-ear headphones 2020: The best Bluetooth, noise-cancelling and wired\nheadphones in the UK](/headphones/1408571/best-over-ear-headphones-uk)\n\n[Best headphones 2020: Get great sound from as little as\n\u00a340](/headphones/1403357/best-headphones-earphones-uk)\n\n[Best noise-cancelling headphones 2020: The best ANC headphones you can\nbuy](/headphones/1406074/best-noise-cancelling-anc-headphones)\n\nFor many, **on-ear and over-ear headphones** are preferable both in terms of\ncomfort and sound. These headphones feature earcups which either create a seal\nover your ears or rest on top of them. The larger size of the headphones\nallows them to contain bigger batteries and features such as active noise\ncancellation (ANC) are more commonplace on pricier sets. ANC uses in-built\nmicrophones to listen to the outside noise and remove it from the music you're\nlistening to \u2013 perfect for noisy commutes or transatlantic flights.\n\n#### How much should I spend?\n\nYou can pick up a pair of **in-ear** Bluetooth headphones for as little as \u00a330\nand these can provide surprisingly good sound quality. We\u2019ve even seen some at\nthis price with the high-quality aptX version of Bluetooth, which is well\nworth having if your smartphone or other devices also support aptX. However,\nsome of the cheaper headphones may lack a built-in microphone for hands-free\ncalls, or have limited battery life, so it's worth checking the manufacturer's\nspecifications before making a decision.\n\n **READ NEXT:[The best cheap headphones to buy](/headphones/1405724/best-\ncheap-budget-headphones-earphones-uk \"best cheap headphones\")**\n\nAbove \u00a350, you\u2019ll get better audio quality as well as additional features such\nas water and sweat-resistance for sporty people, and a wider selection of tips\nfor the earpieces to provide a comfy, secure fit. However, you\u2019ll probably\nneed to step up to \u00a3100 or more to get really good sound from in-ear\nheadphones, including the powerful bass that many people seem to prefer for\ndance tracks or getting motivated at the gym.\n\nYou can also get some very respectable **on-ear and over-ear** Bluetooth\nheadphones for less than \u00a350, and while build quality will tend to be fairly\nplasticky, there are some good options in our list below. If you have a little\nwiggle room in your budget, it's worth paying a little more for a set of\nheadphones that provide better audio quality and sturdy design.\n\nThe \u00a3100 mark is also where other features, such as noise-cancellation start\nto appear as well (although the best noise-cancelling headphones can still\ncost upwards of \u00a3250). You'll often get additional accessories, such as a\ncarrying case, or audio cables that allow you to use them as ordinary wired\nheadphones if the battery runs flat.\n\nAt around \u00a3150 to \u00a3200, you can expect really good sound quality and powerful\nbass. Spend even more, and you'll get great design and stunning sound quality\nas standard \u2013 and the very best active noise cancellation technology on the\nmarket.\n\n **READ NEXT:[Best wireless earbuds](/headphones/1408478/best-wireless-earbuds\n\"best wireless earbuds\")**\n\n## The best over-ear Bluetooth headphones to buy in 2020\n\n **Why you should consider over-ear headphones:** they provide the best\ncomfort and isolation and, depending on your budget, the best sound over\nwireless, too.\n\n### OneOdio A10: The best budget over-ear Bluetooth headphones\n\n **Price:** \u00a354 | **[Buy now from\nAmazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07W5PTCVQ?tag=experevi-21&ascsubtag=1405124\n\"Buy OneOdio A10 from Amazon\")**[ **  \n**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07W5PTCVQ?tag=experevi-21&ascsubtag=1405124)\n\n[\n**![](https://cdn2.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/files/styles/er_main_wide/public/2020/06/bestbluetoothheadphones_oneodioa10.png?itok=gLvvZiwo)**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07W5PTCVQ?tag=experevi-21&ascsubtag=1405124)\n\nAffordable Bluetooth headphones tend to have at least one major chink in their\narmour when it comes to their comfort, sound or noise-cancelling capabilities.\nHowever, the OneOdio A10 manages to get each of those aspects right, with its\nonly real weakness being a lack of support for the aptX codec that allows for\n24-bit streaming.\n\nThe A10\u2019s ANC is particularly effective at blocking out low-end frequencies\nand the 40mm drivers deliver impressive sound with a warm and well-balanced\nsignature. Their reproduction of bass is a little on the woolly side but\nthere\u2019s plenty of detail across the full frequency spectrum.\n\nYou also get a surprising number of accessories given the highly competitive\nprice. Included in the box is a sturdy carrying case, a USB-C to 3.5mm cable,\na USB-A to USB-C charging cable and a 3.5mm x 2 aircraft adapter.\n\n **Read our full[OneOdio A10\nreview](/headphones/1412066/oneodio-a10-bluetooth-anc-headphones-review\n\"Expert Reviews OneOdio A10 review\") for details**\n\n **Key specs \u2013 Headphone type:** Over-ear; **Built-in microphone and music\ncontrol buttons:** Yes; **Plug type:** USB-C; **Weight:** 245g; **Cable\nlength:** 1m\n\n* * *\n\n### Lindy BNX-100: The best over-ear Bluetooth headphones under \u00a3100\n\n **Price:** \u00a370 | **[Buy now from\nAmazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/BNX-100-Bluetooth-Wireless-Cancelling-\nHeadphones-Black/dp/B07PKR4263/?&tag=experevi-21&ascsubtag=1405124)**[  \n](https://www.amazon.co.uk/BNX-100-Bluetooth-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones-\nBlack/dp/B07PKR4263/?&tag=experevi-21&ascsubtag=1405124)\n\n[\n![](https://cdn2.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/files/styles/er_main_wide/public/2020/04/lindy_bnx_100.jpg?itok=ugk01Jxc)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/BNX-100-Bluetooth-\nWireless-Cancelling-Headphones-\nBlack/dp/B07PKR4263/?&tag=experevi-21&ascsubtag=1405124)\n\nThe bigger brother of the Lindy BNX-60, the BNX-100 differ dramatically in\ndesign. The build quality is significantly better thanks to the removal of the\nplastic earcup casing and sonically they are a step up too, with improved\ninstrument separation and greater emphasis on the mid-range. Support for the\naptX codec allows hi-res audio streaming and the addition of an automatic\npause/play feature when you take the headphones off or put them on is a very\nwelcome inclusion.\n\nNoise cancellation may not be best in class but that's not to be expected at\nwas is a very reasonable price, which also gets you a flight adapter plug, a\n1/4\" stereo plug adapter, 1.5m-long 3.5mm audio cable and a hard carrying case\nwith a mesh pouch.\n\n **Read our full[Lindy BNX-100 review](/headphones/1409209/lindy-\nbnx-100-review \"Lindy BNX-100 review\") for details**\n\n **Key specs** **\u2013 Headphone type:** Over-ear; **Built-in microphone and music\ncontrol buttons:** Yes; **Plug type:** 3.5mm jack; **Weight:** 541g; **Cable\nlength:** 1.5m\n\n* * *\n\n### Philips PH805: The best mid-range over-ear Bluetooth headphones\n\n **Price:** \u00a3160 | **[Buy now from Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-\nHeadphones-00-Cancelling-\nBlack/dp/B07Z89CGS5/?&tag=experevi-21&ascsubtag=1405124 \"Buy now from\nAmazon\")**[  \n](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-Headphones-00-Cancelling-\nBlack/dp/B07Z89CGS5/?&tag=experevi-21&ascsubtag=1405124)\n\n[ ![Philips PH805 with\ncase](https://cdn2.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/files/styles/er_main_wide/public/2019/12/philips_ph805_009.jpg?itok=GZgoCOyG)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-\nHeadphones-00-Cancelling-\nBlack/dp/B07Z89CGS5/?&tag=experevi-21&ascsubtag=1405124)\n\nThe Philips PH805 wireless active noise-cancelling headphones blew us away\nwhen we reviewed them. Combining impressive noise-cancellation, comfort and\ngreat audio, the PH805s are a cheaper alternative to ANC heavy hitters such as\nthe Bose QuietComfort 35 II and Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM3s.\n\nNot everyone is into touch controls but the PH805\u2019s implementation of them is\nsimple and effective, allowing the wearer to switch between its three modes\nand control volume with ease. Throw in Bluetooth 5.0 compatibility, a light-\nyet-durable carrying case and a battery life of up to 25 hours with ANC\nswitched on and you\u2019ve got a fantastic pair of headphones at an affordable\nprice.\n\n **Read our full[Philips PH805 review](/headphones/1411247/philips-\nph805-review \"Philips PH805 review\") for details**\n\n **Key specs - Headphone type:** Over-ear; **Built-in microphone and music\ncontrol buttons:** Yes; **Plug type:** 3.5mm jack (optional) **Weight:** 280g\n**Cable length:** 1.3m\n\n![Image of Philips Wireless Headphones PH805BK/00 Bluetooth Headphones\n\\(Bluetooth, Active Noise Cancelling, 30 Hours Battery Life, Hi-Res Audio,\nMicrophone, Google Assistant, Quick Charging Feature\\) Black](https://m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/41RvimiLQLL._SL160_.jpg)  \n\n#### [Philips Wireless Headphones PH805BK/00 Bluetooth Headphones (Bluetooth,\nActive Noise Cancelling, 30 Hours Battery Life, Hi-Res Audio, Microphone,\nGoogle Assistant, Quick Charging Feature)\nBlack](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07Z89CGS5?tag=experevi-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1405124-WIdgetWide)\n\n\u00a3131.23 [Buy\nnow](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07Z89CGS5?tag=experevi-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1405124-WIdgetWide)\n[![](https://cdn1.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/modules/contrib/amazon_wysiwyg/plugins/amazon_wysiwyg/images/amazon_logo.svg)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07Z89CGS5?tag=experevi-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1405124-WIdgetWide)\n![](https://cdn1.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/themes/expertreviews2/images/amazon-\nprime-logo.png)\n\n![Image of Philips Performance PH805 Wireless Bluetooth Active Noise Canceling\nOver Ear Stereo Performance Headphones with Hi-Res Audio, up to 30 Hours of\nPlaytime - Black \\(TAPH805BK\\)](https://m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/41UfI4W3wrL._SL160_.jpg)  \n\n#### [Philips Performance PH805 Wireless Bluetooth Active Noise Canceling Over\nEar Stereo Performance Headphones with Hi-Res Audio, up to 30 Hours of\nPlaytime - Black\n(TAPH805BK)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08232DXKL?tag=expertreviews_us-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1405124-WIdgetWide)\n\n$147.73 [Buy\nnow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08232DXKL?tag=expertreviews_us-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1405124-WIdgetWide)\n[![](https://cdn1.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/modules/contrib/amazon_wysiwyg/plugins/amazon_wysiwyg/images/amazon_logo.svg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08232DXKL?tag=expertreviews_us-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1405124-WIdgetWide)\n![](https://cdn1.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/themes/expertreviews2/images/amazon-\nprime-logo.png)\n\n* * *\n\n###\n\n### Audio-Technica ATH-M50XBT: The best over-ear Bluetooth headphones under\n\u00a3200\n\n **Price:** \u00a3170 | **[Buy now from\nAmazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07HKVCVSY?&tag=experevi-21&ascsubtag=1405124)**[  \n](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07HKVCVSY?&tag=experevi-21&ascsubtag=1405124)\n\n[\n![](https://cdn1.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/files/styles/er_main_wide/public/2018/10/audio-\ntechnica_ath-m50xbt_5.jpg?itok=maA_ZaTj)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07HKVCVSY?&tag=experevi-21&ascsubtag=1405124)\n\nThe Audio Technica ATH-M50XBT are the wireless variants of the\n[ATH-M50X](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50X-Monitor-\nProfessional-Headphones/dp/B00HVLUR86/?&tag=experevi-21&ascsubtag=1405124 \"Buy\nAudio Technica ATH-M50X from Amazon\"), which are among the best wired\nheadphones under \u00a3150.

At first glance, they\nlook pretty similar: both are True Wireless earbuds connectivity, offer active\nnoise cancellation via a pair of microphones on each earbud, and they\u2019re\ncharged by dropping them into the supplied charging case. Like the Sony\nearphones, these are also quite bulky.\n\nThey do have some advantages over Sony\u2019s headphones, however. The case can be\ncharged wirelessly, which is a nice bonus. More importantly, each 1More bud\nhouses twin drivers; one 10mm titanium driver for bass and mids and one\nbalanced armature for the high end. The Sony headphones have only a single 6mm\ndriver per bud. This leads to a cleaner, more detailed overall sound with a\nslight over-emphasis on the bass. Conversely, noise cancellation is effective\nbut not as good as on the Sony WF-1000XM3.\n\nOverall, the 1More True Wireless ANC are well worth considering alongside the\nSony WF-1000XM3. They sound awesome and are sensibly priced as well.\n\n **Key specs** **\u2013 Headphone type:** In-ear true wireless; **Built-in\nmicrophone **and music control buttons** : **Yes; **Plug type:** N/A; **ANC:**\nYes; **Weight:** 8g per bud, 80g inc charging case; **Cable length:** N/A\n\n![Image of 1MORE True Wireless ANC In-Ear Earphones, Stereo Active Noise\nCanceling Wireless Earbuds with Dual ANC Microphone, IR Sensor, ENC, Bluetooth\n5.0, Wireless Earphones for Phone Calls, Home, Office](https://m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/31w4DXvgIHL._SL160_.jpg)  \n\n#### [1MORE True Wireless ANC In-Ear Earphones, Stereo Active Noise Canceling\nWireless Earbuds with Dual ANC Microphone, IR Sensor, ENC, Bluetooth 5.0,\nWireless Earphones for Phone Calls, Home,\nOffice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07ZFDV9VC?tag=experevi-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1405124-WIdgetWide)\n\n\u00a3173.99 [Buy\nnow](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07ZFDV9VC?tag=experevi-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1405124-WIdgetWide)\n[![](https://cdn1.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/modules/contrib/amazon_wysiwyg/plugins/amazon_wysiwyg/images/amazon_logo.svg)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07ZFDV9VC?tag=experevi-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=1405124-WIdgetWide)\n![](https://cdn1.expertreviews.co.uk/sites/expertreviews/themes/expertreviews2/images/amazon-\nprime-logo.png)\n\n#### Read more\n\n[Best Buys](/best-buys)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack to top\n\n  * [You Tube](https://www.youtube.com/user/expertreviews)\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ExpertReviews)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/expertreviews)\n\n  * [Coach](https://www.coachmag.co.uk/)\n  * [IT Pro](http://www.itpro.co.uk/)\n  * [Channel Pro](http://www.channelpro.co.uk/)\n  * [Cloud Pro](http://www.cloudpro.co.uk)\n\n  * [About us](http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/about-us)\n  * [Company website](http://www.dennis.co.uk/)\n  * [Contact us](http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/contact-us)\n  * [Privacy Preferences](//mms.expertreviews.co.uk/cmp/privacy_manager?privacy_manager_id=5c373cec8cd1f133ede2d019&site_id=470)\n  * [Privacy notice](http://www.dennis.co.uk/privacy-policy/)\n  * [Affiliate policy](http://www.dennis.co.uk/affiliate-policy/)\n  * [Manage my mags](https://managemymags.co.uk/login.aspx)\n  * [Voucher Codes](https://www.expertreviews.co.uk/vouchercodes)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 [Dennis](//www.dennis.co.uk) Publishing Limited 2020.
