All of the pre-order prices include steep discounts on the regular price\nat launch. There are 3 price options\n\n  * **$219 > QUIETON SLEEP SINGLE **\n  * **$384 > QUIETON SLEEP COUPLES **\n  * **$714 > QUIETON SLEEP FAMILY **\n\nHowever you can also get **a further 10% discount** with our exclusive coupon\ncode [**SLEEPDISCOUNT10**](https://quieton.com/shop/)\n\n![QuietOn sleep partner snoring](https://sleepgadgets.io/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/QuietOn_sleep-couple-snoring-min-1030x687.jpg)\n\n[Exclusive 10% off QuietOn Sleep Use coupon:\nSLEEPDISCOUNT10](http://rebrand.ly/sleepgadgets)\n\n**Also worth considering: Bose Quiet Comfort 20**\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say [Bose](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones.html)\nhave been at the forefront of noise-cancelling technology for a long-time.\nNobody has yet come close to challenging their noise-cancelling headphones in\nterms of the amount of sound they can effectively block out. It\u2019s not\nsurprising when you consider that for decades, Bose has been an industry\nleader in making aviation headsets for pilots who have to spend hours in noisy\nairplane cockpits.\n\nSo if you\u2019re experiencing noise problems at night that are keeping you awake,\nsuch as a snoring partner, traffic or inconsiderate neighbours, you might want\nto check out the Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones.\n\nThe QuietComfort 20\u2019s (QC20) are an in-ear design, with custom designed\nStayHear+ ear tips and Bose\u2019s famous active noise-cancelling technology.\nWhilst not as ergonomic for sleeping as a headband design, the earbuds are\ndesigned to fit snugly in ear and unless our are suitable even for side\nsleeping. Also you won\u2019t have any problems with overheatingThe earbud tips are\nmade of a soft silicone and there are 3 sizes included to get an ideal fit.\n\nTests have [repeatedly shown](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-noise-\ncancelling-in-ear-headphones/) that the QC20\u2019s are consistent top performers\nwhen it comes to noise-cancelling headphones, reducing noise levels by up to\n45bd in some frequencies (that\u2019s the difference between inside an airplane and\na library!).\n\nThe noise reduction works in a three-fold manner. First, the tight fit of the\nearbud seals your ear canal from external physical sounds, resulting in\npassive noise reduction. Next, you have the magic bit of the equation, the\nactive noise-cancelling technology. (If you\u2019ve ever worn a pair of Bose QC\nheadphones, you\u2019ll know why I describe it as magic!) Finally, you have the\nlast noise-blocking element, which is when you play some actual music through\nthe earphones.\n\nCombining these three processes, the Quiet Comfort 20\u2019s are the most effective\npair of earphones you can buy way to block out noise in your bedroom whilst\nyou sleep.

But for a lot\nof people, paying over $200 for a pair of earphones is just not possible.\n\nSo that\u2019s why we\u2019ve included a cheaper alternative, the TaoTronics Active\nNoise Cancelling Earphones which are currently on sale at Amazon for only $35,\n(or $45 for the newer model).\n\nThe earphones offer active noise cancelling, 15 hours of continuous audio,\nmachined aluminium construction and an inline remote.\n\nNow admittedly, there\u2019s no way these can match their Bose counterparts in\nterms of fidelity and ANC, however, currently these earphones have over 600+\nreviews and a 4.5 star rating with the vast majority of people giving a\npositive review.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for active noise cancelling, but want to save yourself\naround $150 compared to buying a pair of QC20\u2019s then it\u2019s definitely worth\nchecking out the Taotronic alternatives.\n\n## 4) Maxrock Soft Silicon Earbuds\n\n**\ud83c\udf1fBest value headphones for sleeping**\n\n[![MAXROCK Soft Silicon Sleeping Headphones](https://sleepgadgets.io/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/04/MAXROCK-TM-Mini-Total-Soft-Silicone-Earbuds-\nHeadphones-with-Mic-Music-Sleep-Choice-for-Cellphones-Ipad-Tablet-Mp3-Laptop-\nand-Most-35mm-Audio-Player-0-4.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2SkDaTh)\n\nSale\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V9FN1R4?tag=sleepgadgetsusa-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"MAXROCK \\(TM\\) Unique Total Soft Silicon Sleeping Headphones Earplugs Earbuds\nwith Mic for Cellphones,Tablets and 3.5 mm Jack Plug \\(Black\\)\")\n\n[MAXROCK (TM) Unique Total Soft Silicon Sleeping Headphones Earplugs Earbuds\nwith Mic for Cellphones,Tablets and 3.5 mm Jack Plug\n(Black)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V9FN1R4?tag=sleepgadgetsusa-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\n\"MAXROCK \\(TM\\) Unique Total Soft Silicon Sleeping Headphones Earplugs Earbuds\nwith Mic for Cellphones,Tablets and 3.5 mm Jack Plug \\(Black\\)\")\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00V9FN1R4?tag=sleepgadgetsusa-20\n\"Reviews on Amazon\") \u2212$3.17 $8.82\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind wearing earbuds, at less than $15, the the MaxRock soft\nsilicon sleep earphones are one of the best budget options for sleep\nheadphones.\n\nBeing made of silicon, instead of plastic, they are soft to wear and compared\nto many earbud designs have an extremely low profile so they don\u2019t end up\ndigging into your ear canal when your ear is facing the pillow. The double\nlayer earbud design effectively blocks your ears from external noise providing\npassive noise cancellation.\n\n## 5) Amazfit Zenbuds\n\n**\ud83c\udf1fIntelligent sleep earbuds with sleep monitoring**\n\n![Amazfit Zenbuds \\(\u0392\u03bfse Sleepbuds alternative\\)](https://sleepgadgets.io/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/Amazfit-Zenbuds.jpg)\n\nLaunched this year at [CES 2020,](https://sleepgadgets.io/ces-2020-sleep-tech-\nroundup/) Zenbuds from Amazfit is a feature-packed pair of wireless earbuds\ndesigned to support \u201cyour sleep goals by creating the right environment and\ngenerating sleep-inducing and soothing sounds for a perfect night\u2019s rest.\u201d\n\nYou may not have heard of the Amazfit brand, but parent company Huami is a\nworld leader in wearable technology. As well as producing its own range of\nsmartwatches and fitness equipment, Huami is also the exclusive maker of the\nMi Band range for Xiaomi, China\u2019s biggest smartphone manufacturer.\n\nThe Amazfit Zenbuds were announced alongside the company\u2019s PowerBuds, a more\nrugged version designed for sports/fitness. The Zenbuds are tailored\nspecifically towards the needs of sleepers. With an ergonomic, incredibly\ncompact form factor designed to prevent the earbuds falling out during the\nnight, Zenbuds weigh just 1.78g per earbuds, that\u2019s over 3 times lighter than\nApple\u2019s Airpod Pro wireless buds.\n\nZenbuds, an obvious candidate for the best Bose Sleepbuds alternative, are\nsimilarly, not designed to play your own music, but instead feature a library\nof built-in relaxing sounds, including nature, relaxation and meditation\ntracks. ZenBuds also incorporate guided breathing programs to help users\ndevelop relaxation skills and increase your chances of a more restful night\u2019s\nsleep\n\nUsing [Knowles armature technology](https://www.knowles.com/applications/ear-\nsolutions/premium-sound/the-ba-advantage), Zenbuds are able to deliver\nprecision, high-fidelity audio whilst occupying less than 1/2 the volume of\nthe smallest dynamic speakers. Smart sensors inside the earbuds can to figure\nout when you\u2019ve fallen asleep and will shut themselves off, saving battery\nlife\n\n**Available soon in 2020, Zenbuds will retail at around $149.** Here\u2019s a brief\nrundown of the Zenbuds feature list:\n\n  * **Ultra-compact ergonomic design** \u2013 sleep-assisting design to insulate from outside noises, with secure-fit design, so users can move around in bed and switch sides in comfort\n  * **Long battery life \u2013** 12 hours with auto-shut off, giving up to 8 days use on one charge. Included charging case gives another 56 hours of power.\n  * **Sleep monitoring \u2013** built-in sensors monitor sleep position, sleep quality and heart-rate throughout the night. Sleep tracking metrics viewable in companion app.\n  * **Personal alarm** \u2013 built-in alarm function wakes you gently in the morning without disturbing your partner\n\n##### Bose Sleepbuds (Now discontinued \u2013 see below)\n\n**IMPORTANT UPDATE OCT 2019: BOSE SLEEPBUDS HAVE BEEN DISCONTINUED**\n\nIn a surprise announcement, Bose has announced that it is completely\nwithdrawing Bose Sleepbuds from the market, after a raft of of faulty battery\ncomplaints.\n\nIn a statement on the Bose website, John Roselli, General Manager of the Bose\nCorp said:\n\n_\u201cYou\u2019ve reported issues with your sleepbuds\u2122 not charging fully, powering\ndown unexpectedly, or both. And you\u2019ve let us know. We\u2019ve heard you. We\u2019ve\nread your posts. We\u2019ve documented your calls. \u2026. We\u2019ve also relentlessly\nresearched the root cause with a team dedicated to nothing else. Based on what\nwe knew, we believed that software and firmware updates could fix the issues.\nBut the failures have continued, and recently, they\u2019ve increased. That led us\nto look more closely at each piece of hardware. And we learned that while the\nbattery we chose functions safely, it doesn\u2019t work as consistently or\npredictably as it should to meet our standards._  \n_For that reason, we\u2019re discontinuing sleepbuds\u2122.\u201d[Read the full statement\nhere](https://www.bose.com/en_us/support/products/bose_headphones_support/bose_in_ear_headphones_support/noise-\nmasking-\nsleepbuds.html?mc=25_AF_MU_AO_00_CJ_&affiliateid=CJ8532386&cjevent=550f3ccfe8f611e981e602930a18050c)_\n\nBose will be offering a full refund to anyone who has purchased Sleepbuds\nuntil 31st December 2019.\n\n~~Our second recommendation from Bose are the Bose SleepBuds. Having acquired\nSan Diego startup Hush, Bose has combined its unsurpassed engineering\nexcellence with Hush\u2019s miniaturisation innovation to create its first ever\npair of wireless smart sleep earbuds designed exclusively to help improve your\nsleep.~~\n\n~~Unlike the QC30s, the Bose Sleepbuds are designed as a sleep aid first. This\nmeans you won\u2019t be able to use them to play music, as they don\u2019t feature\nBluetooth music streaming \u2013 and is one of the reason that the SleepBuds will\ngive you a much longer battery life than most wireless earbuds.~~\n\n~~The Sleepbuds use noise-masking technology, as opposed to the active noise\ncancellation used in their noise-cancelling counterparts the Bose QuietControl\nQC30 earphones.~~\n\n~~Instead, these wireless sleep buds, utilizing an improved version of the\nHush\u2019s technology, contain 10 pre-loaded soothing sounds, stored on the\ninternal flash memory. These sounds replace to mask and block out\nenvironmental noise that keeps you awake at night, such as busy traffic, noisy\nneighbors or a partner who snores.~~\n\n~~The expertly engineered masking sounds are aided by passively attenuating\near-tips which help as a physical barrier to block out unwanted sounds in your\nbedroom.~~\n\n~~A rechargeable zinc-iron micro-battery holds enough charge to last for two\ndays. In addition the included carry case also provides on additional full\ncharge when unplugged from the mains, helpful for when you\u2019re travelling or on\novernight trips.~~\n\n~~The Bose Ear Buds are designed to work with the accompanying Bose Sleep App,\nwhich features a smart alarm function you can use without waking up your\npartner.~~\n\n## 6) Kokoon EEG Headphones\n\n**\ud83c\udf1fSmart sleeping headphones with intelligent audio library**\n\n![Kokoon Headphones Grey](https://sleepgadgets.io/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/Kokoon-Headphones-in-Grey-1030x687.jpg)Kokoon \u2013 also\navailable in Grey\n\n[Buy Kokoon Now TAKE 10% OFF WITH CODE\nSG10](https://kokoon.io/?ref=2nlNvoxpsZ6S)\n\nAvailable right now for $299,\n[Kokoon](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8764099-13617713?sid=prodguide) is the\nworld\u2019s first sleep sensing headphone with Raising over $2 million on\nKickstarter, Kokoon is a pair of hi-tech headphones that feature built-in EEG\n(electroencephalogram) sensors that can track and measure your brainwaves as\nyou sleep.\n\n_**> > Read our in-depth [Kokoon Review](https://sleepgadgets.io/kokoon-\nheadphones-review/) right here**_\n\nKokoon packs plenty of other features too including active noise cancellation,\nintelligent white noise which adapts to your environment, Bluetooth 4.0,\naccelerometry movement sensors and microphones to detect noise disturbances.\n\nDespite being a full size headphone, Kokoon is designed very much with sleep\nand comfort in mind. The headphones features \u2018FlexMould\u2019 technology which\nadapts to the shape of your head. The headphones are also ventilated to allow\nyour head to breathe at night.\n\nAn \u2018advanced\u2019 seal ensures that sound is blocked from the outside world, so\nyou get the triple whammy of passive and active noise cancellation, plus the\nbenefits of the active white noise system.\n\n## Buyer\u2019s Guide\n\nFirst of all you need to decide on what type of headphones will be most\nsuitable for your sleeping habits. Here are some of the different types you\nmight encounter:\n\n#### On-ear headphones for sleeping\n\n![On-ear headphones for sleeping](https://sleepgadgets.io/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/04/gen-3.5-thumb.png)**On-ear sleeping headphones**\n\nAny audio buff will tell you that over the ear headphones will generally give\nyou the highest quality, most \u2018open\u2019 sound, but finding a pair to wear in bed\ncan be tricky.\n\nOver the ear headphones are ideal for people who sleep on their backs and to a\nlesser extent side sleepers.\n\nSo if you can\u2019t bear the thought of a pair of earbuds sticking in their ear\ncanal all night, on-ear headphones might be the only option.\n\nComfort is a top consideration so you need to look for a pair that either have\na thin profile, such as [Dubslabs\u2019\nBedphones](https://sleepgadgets.io/bedphones-gen-3-5/), which are available in\nwired or wireless models.\n\n#### Earbuds for sleeping\n\n![In ear headphones for sleeping \\(earbuds\\)](https://sleepgadgets.io/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/02/in-ear-headphone-earbuds-for-sleeping-\nmin.jpg)**Earbuds or in-ear headphones**\n\nWith just about everyone on the planet owning a smart-phone these days, these\nare the most common types of headphones used today.\n\nIn-ear phones will give you the best sound isolation and hence good sound\nquality, but you need to ensure a perfect fit, especially when you consider\nyou\u2019ll be tossing and turning throughout the night.\n\nApart from ensuring a good fit, you have to consider your sleeping position.\nIf you\u2019re primarily a side sleeper, you might find that certain in-ear phones\nend up digging into your ear during the night \u2013 not a pleasant experience at\nall.\n\nOne other consideration to bear in mind with in-ear headphones is hygiene. If\nyou\u2019re wearing your earphones for hours every night then there\u2019s a good chance\nit will end up increasing the levels of bacteria in your ears. So bear this in\nmind if you don\u2019t want to end up with an ear infection.\n\n#### Headband phones\n\n![Headband earphones for sleeping](https://sleepgadgets.io/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/02/Fabric-headband-earphones-for-sleeping-\nmin.jpg)**Headband-style earphones for sleeping**\n\nMany of the new sleeping headphones in recent years have taken the form of a\nheadband design \u2013 a fabric head wraparound with embedded speakers.\n\nThese designs offer the ultimate comfort when it comes to choosing headphones\nfor sleeping and they are excellent choices if you\u2019re a die-hard side-sleeper\nor like listening to ASMR sleep sounds as you drift off.\n\nHowever with some models this comes with a slight compromise in sound quality\ncompared to other types of design as the speakers might shift position in the\nheadband during the night.\n\nAnother consideration with headband designs is the choice of material. If you\nsweat a lot at night, you\u2019ll probably want to avoid a fleece-type fabric and\ninstead go for a lighter type material such as one of the Lycra options\navailable.\n\n### Wireless sleep headphones\n\nCables. Don\u2019t you just hate them? Luckily, these days there are many options\nto choose from either wire-free or traditional headphones with a 3.5mm\nattached cable. If you want to go for the wireless option, one of the biggest\nconsiderations in your choice of sleeping headphones is battery life.\n\nModern Bluetooth headphones are getting better every day but you need to find\nout how many hours of music playback your headphones will give you in wireless\nmode.\n\nIf wires don\u2019t really bother you, should still take into consideration the\nsafety risks of sleeping with a wire strapped around your head. If you\u2019re a\nrestless sleeper, you don\u2019t want to find yourself choked in the middle of the\nnight because your headphone cord has been wrapped around your neck several\ntimes.\n\nNoise cancelling sleep headphones?If you need to block out noise at night,\nsuch as **your partner\u2019s snoring** , then you\u2019ll want to consider a pair of\n**noise cancelling sleeping headphones**. There are two types of noise\ncancelling \u2013 **passive and active**.\n\n**Passive noise cancelling** is actually just another term for physically\nblocking out noise from reaching your ears \u2013 for instance sticking your\nfingers in your ears. Thankfully headphone technology offers a lot more\nsophistication than this approach, and many passive noise cancellation\nheadphones are specially designed to form a perfect block between the noisy\nenvironment and your ear canal.\n\n**Active noise cancellation (ANC)** on the other hand requires dedicated\nelectronics and signal processing. This technique uses a microphone to monitor\nthe sound in your bedroom, and feeds a \u2018mirror image\u2019 audio signal into your\nheadphones which has the net effect of cancelling out any environmental noise\n\u2013 be it the drone of traffic, or your snoring partner.\n\nBear in mind that ANC is not 100% effective, even with the most high-end\nheadphones, but combined with passive noise blocking and music playing in the\nbackground it can still make a huge difference in reducing noise levels.\n\nSo, enough of an introduction, here are our recommendations for the best\nheadphones for sleeping, divided into separate categories depending on whether\nyou want to pick headphones based on comfort, price, noise cancellation,\nversatility, or smart features.\n\n### Summary\n\nWe hoped you enjoyed our roundup of the best sleeping headphones in 2020. One\nthing\u2019s for sure, if you like to drift off to sleep with a relaxing soundscape\nin your ears, there\u2019s plenty of options as to how you go about it.
