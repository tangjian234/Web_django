Pair one up with one of the [best\nsmartphones](https://www.toptenreviews.com/best-smartphones), and you're all\nset for calls, music, and more.\n\nTheir compact, often single-ear nature means they are far easier to wield and\nwear than over-ear headsets; while their wireless nature - somewhat obviously\n- makes them easier to use than wired headphones that have easily-tangled\ncables. They're also handy for gaming, especially if you're playing against\nother people via a phone or [tablet](https://www.toptenreviews.com/best-\ntablets).\n\nTesting and reviewing a range of competitors from the best in the business, we\nhave narrowed down the best bluetooth headsets in the market to this guide -\nbut also products that will suit particular work environments, needs and uses.\n\n* * *\n\n## 1\\.

Beyond its\nstylish appearance, the Stealth\u2019s design makes the headset comfortable enough\nfor all-day wear and is simultaneously intuitive and simple to use. The\nbiggest plus point the Jabra Stealth has over its competitors is a superior\nperformance in audio quality and calls. It\u2019s also easy to set up and pair, and\nits two buttons are simple to figure out after little use. The max volume\nlevel stays around 84dB, and its ear cushions block enough ambient noise that\nyou can clearly hear notifications and calls even on the lower end of the\nvolume range.\n\nThe Stealth is more likely to fit comfortably because it offers more options\nthan others: included in the box are six earpiece size options and two\nseparate, different ear hooks enabling you many options through which to find\nyour ideal wearing style. At only eight grams, the Stealth is one of the\nlightest Bluetooth devices we tested, which is a good thing if you\u2019re planning\non wearing it all day. Its battery lasts for up to six hours of talk time and\nup to ten days on standby and once the battery is depleted, it only takes\nabout two hours to get back to full. This area reveals one weakness of the\nStealth however, as it doesn\u2019t include a wall adapter or car charger upon\npurchase and the charging has to be done via USB.\n\nEven though it still holds its value - you won't get it for bargain price -\nthe amount of bang for buck you get with this headset means this is really\ntremendous value, and the best one you can currently spend your hard earned\nmoney on.\n\n  *  **Read our**[ **Jabra Stealth review**](https://www.toptenreviews.com/bluetooth-headsets-jabra-stealth-review)\n\n* * *\n\n## 2\\.

Not\nto be disparaging or stereotypical, of course, but its design is not shy about\nwhat it is. This bluetooth headset is a bulky unit but performs incredibly\nwell. It uses its size well, incorporating a solid set of features and\nbuttons: volume controls; a dedicated power switch; voice button; a call\nbutton; an NFC pairing zone; power and battery indicator lights; and a\nmicroUSB charging port. That\u2019s already a lot of bang for buck.\n\nIt then backs these up with a solid performance and audio quality for all\ncalls, enhanced by a particular feature. The four-microphone design of the\n5200 ensures that an awful lot of environmental audio gets soaked up and\ndoesn't interfere with your media or calls. Whereas most headsets only employ\ntwo microphones in such a design, the 5200s use of four is excellent and very\nmuch worth it, adding quality to an already very competent headset.\n\nWhile it is on the bulky and heavy side, the Voyager 5200 is easily the best\nat that end of the spectrum. Good for outdoor use and great for business use\n(office or commutes particularly), its four-microphone setup is incredibly\neffective at ensuring environmental audio doesn't interfere with your calls\nand audio. Combine that with great volume, and this is one of the best\nbluetooth headsets generally, as well as being best in class for around-the-\near sets.\n\n  * **Read our**[ **Plantronics Voyager 5200 review**](https://www.toptenreviews.com/bluetooth-headsets-plantronics-voyager-5200-review)\n\n* * *\n\n## 3\\. Jabra Steel: Most durable bluetooth headset\n\n![Jabra Steel: Most durable bluetooth\nheadset](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/toptenreviews/media/img/missing-\nimage.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Jabra)\n\n### [Jabra Steel](https://www.toptenreviews.com/bluetooth-headsets-jabra-\nreview)\n\nA tough bluetooth headset, ideal for anyone working outdoors\n\nPrime\n\n[$64.95](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45725&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0194VYPQ0%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtoptenreviews-\nus-8266187998698634000-20)\n\n[View at\nAmazon](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45725&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0194VYPQ0%3Ftag%3Dhawk-\nfuture-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3Dtoptenreviews-\nus-8266187998698634000-20)\n\n[See all prices (2\nfound)](https://www.toptenreviews.com/deals/compare?model_name=Jabra%20Steel&filter_product_types=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback)\n\nShock, water and dust resistant\n\nVersatile fit\n\nGreat audio and noise-canceling\n\nQuieter overall audio\n\nThis is one of our favorites across the board, but also for a specific use:\noutdoor calls. As the name suggests, the Steel is most at home for those who\nuse their headset in loud, outdoor environments and its water, dust and shock-\nresistance are incredibly attractive features.\n\nIt has a rubberized black body, large buttons (that can be used while wearing\ngloves), several included earpieces and ear hooks, and a windsock to put over\nthe boom mic to minimize environmental noise. It borders on being a little\nbig, particularly for those with smaller ears, but the headset always stays in\nplace successfully, especially with the ear hooks attached. The fit is\nversatile too as it can be worn with or without the hooks depending on your\ncomfort and the situation. You can also use voice commands to accept or reject\nincoming calls.\n\nThe Steel puts out less overall volume than other products we tested, but it\ndid very well at isolating voices and canceling out ambient noise on both ends\nof the call, making it a great choice for hectic environments. Its robustness,\nresistance and durability cannot be overstated however, and that's where its\nreal strength lies.\n\n  *  **Read our**[ **Jabra Steel review**](https://www.toptenreviews.com/bluetooth-headsets-jabra-review)\n\n* * *\n\n## 4\\.

While made by a gaming peripheral company,\nand clearly gaming-focused, these earbuds perform very well as a Bluetooth\nheadset in their own right - even discounting all of the excellence in other\nareas.\n\nChanneling Razer's audio pedigree, the Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds have\nsome of the best audio quality in all the products we've tested - the range,\ndetail and depth is excellent. While this is designed for music and games\nprimarily, it translates extraordinarily well for calls and notifications. The\ndesign is slick and modern, and nothing is overcomplicated in their form,\nmaking for easy to fit and comfy earbuds.\n\nDespite suffering from occasional Bluetooth dropouts when using the earbuds\nfor media, the performance is still easily good enough for us to recommend\nthem as one of the most versatile and multi-faceted Bluetooth headsets going.\nIt is their quality elsewhere, in sound quality, design and build, and decent\nfeature set that really makes this headset successful. For those looking for a\nBluetooth headset with more strings to its bow than usual, and for those who\nlook to get more for their money, this is a great choice.\n\n  *  **Read our**[ **Razer Hammerhead True Wireless review**](https://www.toptenreviews.com/razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-earbuds-review)\n\n* * *\n\n## 5\\.

Getting the downsides out\nthe way, the fit of this headset is not great on the whole. It really takes\nsome work to be comfortable as well as to acquire that snug feeling, where one\nis confident the headset won't slip out.\n\nHowever this is in total contrast with its excellence in battery life - ten\nhours of talk time or two weeks on standby - and audio quality. As a result,\nthis headset borders on the mercurial, if the word can be applied to a\nBluetooth headset. The Presence has sheer audio quality by the bagful, which\nis complemented by a great design and outstanding battery life, but its design\nand fit slightly jar with this. When you're on calls and have manipulated it\ninto a comfortable position, it's one of the best out there, but because it's\ninconsistent in respect of the latter, and it has a high price tag, it falls a\nbit short of its true potential. Still, we don't mean to put potential buyers\noff, this is still a great headset.\n\nThe Sennheiser Presence is a great Bluetooth headset and the best for those\nwho want a long and reliable battery life above all else. Putting its fit, low\nvolume range, and price tag to one side, the Sennheiser headset performs well,\nwith Sennheiser-quality audio, excellent battery life, and the good\naccessories included making it a very worthwhile purchase.\n\n  *  **Read our**[ **Sennheiser Presence review**](https://www.toptenreviews.com/bluetooth-headsets-sennheiser-review)\n\n* * *\n\n## Why trust us for Bluetooth headsets?\n\nWe always thoroughly test and research products in order to present a range of\noptions, whether you're after supreme comfort, water resistance and\ndurability, or simply stellar call performance.\n\nAll the Bluetooth headsets here have been tested and, at the very least, did\nwhat they were supposed to \u2013 they paired to a test phone, gave notifications\nof incoming calls and texts, and even connected to other apps to play music or\naccess a voice assistant. The true value of testing all these products in the\nsame manner is that a clear 'side-by-side' picture can be painted. In turn\nthis means all important factors can be focused on so as to identify each\nproduct's strengths and weaknesses both in their own right as well as\nrelatively.\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/toptenreviews/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n## How we tested\n\nBy testing these Bluetooth headsets for many hours, poring over manuals,\nonline reviews and product specs in addition to hours of hands-on testing for\neach product, we are confident that we have thoroughly tested them out. We\nselected our top contenders by finding the best, most buzzworthy and highest-\nrated Bluetooth headsets \u2013 focusing on small, single-ear devices.\n\nTo set up each headset, we unboxed, charged and paired them sequentially to\nthe same smartphone. We tried on all the included ear cushions and hook\ncombinations to find the most comfortable configurations, and then used them\nin diverse environments to make sure they performed well in any circumstance.\nWe made and received calls, tested out voice command features, pressed buttons\nand listened to the same YouTube videos multiple times.\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/toptenreviews/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n## How to choose a Bluetooth headset for you\n\nIn our quest to find the best Bluetooth headsets, we consulted an industry\nexpert for some extra information and guidance. Adam Robertson, Senior Product\nMarketing Manager at Jabra, gave particularly good advice on how to choose the\nbest Bluetooth headset: \u201cIt comes down to the value of the conversation and\nthe environment you\u2019re going to be in,\u201d he told us. \u201cIf you know these two\nthings, you can start your shopping experience or research at a good point. If\nyou don\u2019t know that, you could end up spending too much and buying too much\nfor what you need. Or worse, you could end up spending too little and then not\nbeing happy with the experience.\u201d\n\n **Call Quality** _  \n_ A headset\u2019s performance on a call relies on audio and voice working together\nseamlessly. Hearing difficulties put a severe strain on the conversation \u2013\nboth parties should hear the other end of the line clearly. Headsets with two\nor more microphones help to filter environmental noises like wind or traffic\nout of your calls. Generally, the closer the mic is to your mouth, the better,\nso larger headsets have a bit of an advantage here, though many smaller\nheadsets performed well in our tests. Factors such as volume range and even\nthe fit of the device can also play into the headset\u2019s performance during a\ncall.\n\n**Comfort & Fit** _  \n_ In our tests, we found that the weight of the headset directly correlated\nwith how comfortable it was to wear for an extended period of time. Other\nfactors affect the overall fit and comfort of a Bluetooth headset as well,\nincluding the wearing style, earbud options and ear hooks. All the products we\ntested come with multiple earbud options and after several rounds of wear-\ntesting, we recommend ear gels that direct sound into your ear canal and in-\near loops for stability. Over-ear hooks can help with stability, though we\nfound headsets built specifically for over-ear wear instead of in-ear wear are\nnot quite as comfortable.\n\n **Unified Communications** _  \n_ In Bluetooth headsets, a unified communications (UC) specification means\nthat the headset comes with a USB dongle and a wider range of connectivity for\nmultiple platforms. However this is only important if you plan on using your\nBluetooth headset extensively for business and need the extra functionality.\nThe upgrades are expensive - some even doubling the price tag - but any of the\nnon-UC options will work great for hands-free phone use. Still, it\u2019s a nice\noption if you often need to use your headset for conference calls or other\noffice functions.\n\n **Price** _  \n_ Much like most modern tech, there are a range of prices going in the\nBluetooth headset market, varying wildly from $20 or so to more than $100.\nProducts with a slightly higher price tag, nearing but not necessarily at, the\nthree figure mark do perform better and offer great bang-for-buck value. Extra\nfeatures, such as a charging case or USB dongle for UC function, cost extra\nand can sometimes even double the price of the device. We always try to keep\ntesting products so you can expect to see more added to this list from the\nperspective of price and value, as well as other niches some headsets will be\nexcellent for.\n\n## Other Bluetooth options\n\nAlthough mono Bluetooth headsets are great for calls in an office or during\nyour commute, they aren't ideal for all situations. Truck drivers, for\nexample, often use heavy-duty Bluetooth headsets with heartier noise\ncancellation features and padded ear cups.\n\nWith smartphones shedding their headphone jacks, the number and quality of\nBluetooth stereo headphones on the market has shot up as well. These products\nhave the advantage of better audio quality than Bluetooth mono headsets.\nBluetooth headphones also have built-in, hands-free calling functionality. In\naddition, you can hear the other end of the call with both ears, though the\nmics on mono headsets are usually better than those on headphones. And if you\nprefer the idea of headphones but want to go tether free, consider true\nwireless headphones. These tend to be a pricier than normal Bluetooth\nheadphones and many Bluetooth mono headsets, but, again, they can offer better\naudio quality than a mono headset and don\u2019t have any strings to hold you down.\n\nRound up of today's best deals\n\nJabra Stealth
