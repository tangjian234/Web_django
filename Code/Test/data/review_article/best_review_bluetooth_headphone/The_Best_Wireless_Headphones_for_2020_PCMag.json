Sony Walkman, and\nthat's roughly how long we've put up with tangled wires while listening to\nmusic on the go. That's long enough, if you ask us. Fortunately, this is where\nwireless headphones come in. They're convenient for any situation where you\ndon't want to deal with dangling cables\u2014especially at the gym. And now that\nmany phone makers are ditching the headphone jack, wireless headphones are a\ngood way to ensure compatibility with just about any new device.\n\nWireless no longer means poor sound, either. These days, Bluetooth audio\nsounds much better than it ever has. Even though the stereo Bluetooth data\nsignal is compressed, various headphone and earphone vendors have discovered\nways of enhancing the signal to compensate for deficiencies in fidelity. Check\nout our buying advice below before picking the perfect pair.\n\n## Wireless Earphones vs. Headphones\n\nEarphones (or earbuds, or in-ear headphones) offer a slightly different sound\nprofile compared with conventional headphones. Generally, you'll get better\nsound from a full set of \"cans\" around your head than from buds in your ears,\nbut in-ear sound quality has improved a great deal. More importantly, in-ear\nheadphones are much more likely to be water resistant, and much better suited\nfor use when working out. Get a good sweat going, and you'll turn your\nheadphone earpads into a nasty mess. For our top picks, check out the [best\nearphones](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-earbuds-in-ear-headphones),\nthe [best headphones for running](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-\nbluetooth-headphones-for-running), and [the best true wireless earphones for\nrunning](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-true-wireless-earbuds-for-\nrunning).\n\n![Man wearing headphones while splashing water in his\nface](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20432'%3E%3Crect%20fill='%23f7f7f7'%20/%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nIf you aren't primarily looking for a set of wireless earphones for the gym,\nconventional headphones can offer a very good listening experience. You'll\nstill have to choose between on-ear and over-ear models, however. On-ear\nheadphones rest the earcups against your ears, but don't surround them. Over-\near headphones completely enclose your ears. Over-ear headphones block out the\nmost outside noise and usually provide a more powerful, rich sound, but on-ear\nheadphones are less bulky and distracting to wear when you're out and about.\nSee the [best headphones](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-headphones) for\nmore.\n\n### The Best Wireless Headphone Deals This Week*\n\n  * [ Sony WHXB900N Noise Cancelling Headphones ](https://www.pcmag.com/otc/01r1WRIAJykbQgN4oGQ8FSi/05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07RM8WQ8G%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26psc%3D1&t=roundup-page&m=roundup-deals&e=&i=Sony+WHXB900N+Noise+Cancelling+Headphones&p=1&el=Sony+WHXB900N+Noise+Cancelling+Headphones&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcmag.com%2Fpicks%2Fthe-best-wireless-headphones&cd2=Roundup&cd62=06s3E95tGen8A2S7z9aJjJf&cd63=02PVNp60rEb30ZbtKiwdnWM) \u2014 **$178.00** _(List Price $248; Save $70)_\n  * [ Beats by Dr. Dre Beats Studio3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones ](https://www.pcmag.com/otc/01r1WRIAJykbQgN4oGQ8FSi/07ceq7iAfFfRlRYt8DCvPYM?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbeats-by-dr-dre-beats-studio-wireless-noise-cancelling-headphones-gray%2F6316142.p%3FskuId%3D6316142&t=roundup-page&m=roundup-deals&e=&i=Beats+by+Dr.+Dre+Beats+Studio3+Wireless+Noise+Cancelling+Headphones&p=2&el=Beats+by+Dr.+Dre+Beats+Studio3+Wireless+Noise+Cancelling+Headphones&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcmag.com%2Fpicks%2Fthe-best-wireless-headphones&cd2=Roundup&cd62=03MXqpq8mTrhu3YpTViKgSc&cd63=01wLg3kYK7DUlWPu4BEdoqu) \u2014 **$349.99** _(List Price $349.99; Save $150)_\n  * [ Sennheiser RS 175 RF Wireless Headphone System ](https://www.pcmag.com/otc/01r1WRIAJykbQgN4oGQ8FSi/05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSennheiser-RS-175-Wireless-Headphone%2Fdp%2FB00SLUI5SA&t=roundup-page&m=roundup-deals&e=&i=Sennheiser+RS+175+RF+Wireless+Headphone+System&p=3&el=Sennheiser+RS+175+RF+Wireless+Headphone+System&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcmag.com%2Fpicks%2Fthe-best-wireless-headphones&cd2=Roundup&cd62=00v92MmkJnyvKHkHtw2Cmrb&cd63=03vJ9SnyBzFhGIPgqIs0oMF) \u2014 **$198.00** _(List Price $279.95; Save $81.67)_\n\n*Deals are selected by our partner, [TechBargains](https://www.techbargains.com/)\n\nAnd if you're shopping for your little one, we've also rounded up a collection\nof the best wired and wireless [headphones for\nkids](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-kids-headphones).\n\n## How Long Do Bluetooth Headphones Last?\n\nBluetooth headphones are convenient when they're charged, but once the\nbatteries run out you're left without music. Some headphone manufacturers\ninclude a portable charging case, like Apple does with its\n[AirPods](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-airpods-2nd-generation). Others\ninclude a 3.5mm detachable cable.\n\n **[See How We Test Headphones](https://www.pcmag.com/about/how-we-test-\nheadphones)**\n\nFor models with a wired option, you can plug the cable in and use them as\nconventional headphones until you can charge them again, and use them without\nissue on airplanes, to boot. Wireless earphones almost never have this option,\nbecause they're already so small there simply isn't any room to place a\nheadphone cable jack.\n\n## What Are the Best Noise-Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones?\n\nActive noise cancellation uses outward-facing microphones to pick up and\nanalyze noise, which then gets canceled out by circuitry that generates an\ninverse wave in the headphones. It was previously an expensive, cumbersome\ntechnology that couldn't be found on wireless headphones, but that changed a\nfew years ago with advances in battery life and circuit miniaturization.\nYou'll pay a premium for headphones with active noise cancellation, but it's a\nhandy feature if you just want to tune out everything around you besides your\nmusic. For more, check out the [best noise-cancelling\nheadphones](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-noise-cancelling-headphones)\nand the [best noise-cancelling true wireless\nearphones](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-noise-cancelling-true-\nwireless-earbuds).\n\n## What About Completely Wire-Free Earbuds?\n\nTruly wireless earphones completely remove the cable and make each earpiece\nits own discrete device that wirelessly syncs with the other one. Apple got\nthe wire-free ball rolling with the AirPods, and since then many other\nearphone manufacturers have been working on their own takes on the concept.\n\nWire-free earphones are generally gym-friendly, with most models sporting some\nform of water resistance. They also usually come with their own battery-\nequipped carrying case for keeping them topped off when not in use, and the\nsimple advantage of not dealing with a wire is its own significant benefit.\n\n![Jabra Elite Sport\nHeadphones](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20432'%3E%3Crect%20fill='%23f7f7f7'%20/%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nThe trade-off is that most wire-free earphones have inferior battery life\ncompared with tethered models, forcing you to pop them in their charging case\nfairly often. Their small size also means on-earphone controls are generally\nlimited, and their price is usually significantly more than similar tethered\nwireless earphones. Our reviews go into greater detail about these benefits\nand limitations, and highlight how certain models are starting to overcome\nthese growing pains.\n\nFor more, see the [best true wireless\nearphones](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/airpod-alternatives-the-best-true-\nwireless-earbuds).\n\n## Do You Need Apple's H1 Chip?\n\nIf you're an iPhone user, it's worth considering a pair of headphones that use\nApple's proprietary H1 (or older W1) chip. The chip makes Bluetooth pairing\neven easier\u2014there's no need to open the Settings menu, as your phone\nautomatically prompts you to connect whenever the headphones are nearby. The\nchip also makes for a more stable connection and increased wireless range.\n\nCurrently only Apple and Beats (which is owned by Apple) make headphones with\nthe chip, but that might change in the future.\n\n## How Much Should You Spend on Wireless Headphones?\n\nThis is a look at the top wireless headphones we've tested overall, regardless\nof price. As such, many of the options here fall in the $100 and up range.\nThat doesn't mean you need to spend a lot of money to get headphones that\ndeliver quality audio.
