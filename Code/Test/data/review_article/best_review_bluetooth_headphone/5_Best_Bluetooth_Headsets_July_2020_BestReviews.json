This technology is great if you\nwant to:\n\n  * Keep your hands free while listening to music\n  * Enjoy audio entertainment during a workout\n  * Take phone calls while simultaneously doing other things\n\nThe Bluetooth device market is saturated with hundreds of makes and models,\nranging from high-grade products to flimsy wears. Without testing them first,\nit\u2019s difficult to know whether any given product is worth the cash.\n\nThat\u2019s where we come in. At BestReviews, our goal is to provide consumers with\nhonest, unbiased reviews of the best products available.\n\nFor this reason, we never accept \u201cfree\u201d manufacturer samples. We buy products\noff of store shelves just as you do, and we scrutinize them for quality.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to jump into a purchase, please see the product list above for\nour top recommendations. If you\u2019d like to learn more about Bluetooth headsets\nbefore laying your money down, please continue reading this shopping guide for\nhelpful information and advice.\n\nStay connected\n\nGet exclusive content, advice, and tips from BestReviews delivered to your\ninbox.\n\nSubscribe\n\nLike us on Facebook!\n\nStay updated\n\n[ ](https://www.facebook.com/bestreviews) [ ](https://twitter.com/bestreviews)\n[ ](https://www.instagram.com/bestreviews) [\n](https://www.linkedin.com/company/6636827) [\n](https://www.youtube.com/bestreviews) [\n](https://www.pinterest.com/BestReviews/)\n\n![](//cdn14.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/image-full-\npage-1040/4643129375a838f32c9abeafea6d077b.jpg)\n\nBluetooth beats out infrared and is on par with RF; the only difference is its\nlow power consumption, which results in longer battery life.\n\n##  Choosing the right headset\n\nEach bluetooth device offers features that make whatever you\u2019re doing easier.\nThe best device for you is one that best meets your needs.\n\nSo why do you want a Bluetooth headset? How will you use it?\n\n###  Average use\n\nThe \u201caverage\u201d consumer uses Bluetooth headphones for:\n\n  * Answering a call while driving\n  * Listening to music while on the go\n  * Making a conference call on the go\n  * Listening to text messages as they\u2019re read aloud by a device\n  * Making verbal notes for later\n\nIn these scenarios, the headset rarely leaves the owner\u2019s home, office, or\npocket. It sits on its charger much of the time and isn\u2019t subjected to\nextraordinary wear and tear.\n\n![](//cdn16.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/layout-\nconvert-120x120/e96b2ce5c25dfd4002011354654bee68.jpg)\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nThree types of wireless technology exist: infrared, radio frequency (RF), and\nbluetooth. Infrared is great, but it can easily be blocked when an object\n(like a wall) gets in its way. RF is also good, but much like a radio station,\nit loses strength the farther you get from it.\n\n###  Travel use\n\nDo you spend lots of time commuting in a car, subway, or plane? If so, you\nneed a device that can pretty much go anywhere and be ready to take a call at\na moment\u2019s notice. Motorola and JETech offer some terrific options for people\nwho travel frequently, like battery life of up to 12 hours and noise-\ncancelling microphone to suit those who may find themselves working on a\ncrowded train or in a noisy airport.\n\n###  Workout use\n\nDo you use your device when you\u2019re working out at the gym? While you\u2019re biking\nor jogging? People who exercise while wearing their bluetooth device need\nsomething that can withstand extensive movement and sweat. The\n[LG](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NW2JBYO/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=bestprod06-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=2c1514b75275fa341a4818a15e87a192&camp=1789&creative=9325)\nbrand offers some of the best headsets in terms of comfort, durability, and\nsustainability for extended periods of time.\n\n![](//cdn15.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/layout-\nconvert-120x120/8448b9fca71e83515784d23f44d2f81f.jpg)\n\nEXPERT TIP\n\nBluetooth is a dream for anyone who uses their hands frequently for their\nwork. This includes carpenters, electricians, chefs, mechanics, artists, and\nmany more.\n\n* * *\n\nStaff | BestReviews\n\n##  Features to consider\n\nNo two Bluetooth models are exactly alike. Each manufacturer has its own spin\non what\u2019s considered a \u201cBluetooth necessity.\u201d Consider the following features\nwhen deciding what you value the most:\n\n  * Sound\n  * Voice commands\n  * Volume control\n  * Battery life\n  * Design/comfort\n\n![](//cdn12.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/layout-\nconvert-120x120/c27079976c8a37ab46c474f8bb998dcc.jpg)\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nMost Bluetooth headsets come with an earpiece hook. The hook doesn\u2019t affect\naudio quality; it\u2019s simply there to keep the device in place.\n\n###  Sound\n\nThe greatest concern for anyone buying a headset is the type of audio quality\nthey\u2019re going to get. We could pontificate on signal strength and the\nintegrity of the audio you load/stream onto your device. But ultimately, just\nbeing able to hear it properly is probably the top concern for people\npurchasing a Bluetooth device.\n\nBluetooth\u2019s mobility and signal sets it apart from other technologies.\n\n###  Voice commands\n\nThe two most popular systems for smartphones are iOS and Android. Each\ncontains its own voice prompt system with the built-in Siri and the\ndownloadable Cortana, respectively.\n\nHowever, the fact that you have a system doesn\u2019t mean your Bluetooth will\nrespond to it. That may sound odd, but keep this in mind: few cellphone\ndesigners create their own wireless headphone system. With the exception of\nthe iPhone 7, most everything still operates with a headphone jack.\n\nBecause of this, most headphones that contain a microphone and button system\nare compatible with voice prompts. But not every Bluetooth device follows\nsuit. The\n[JETech](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00T40UK20/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=bestprod06-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=2c1514b75275fa341a4818a15e87a192&camp=1789&creative=9325),\nfor example, doesn\u2019t respond to voice prompts and contains no software to\ncorrect the issue \u2014 it\u2019s simply for listening.\n\n![](//cdn16.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/layout-\nconvert-120x120/ad451c9dc18acf31859fe33a7fe0adf8.jpg)\n\nEXPERT TIP\n\nIf making voice commands and doing speech-to-text are an everyday thing for\nyou, aim for a device that responds to the software you already have\navailable.\n\n* * *\n\nStaff | BestReviews\n\n###  Volume control\n\nWhatever device you use, you can adjust its volume with built-in audio\ncontrols. For example, most cell phones sport a volume control button on the\nside.\n\nMany Bluetooth devices include their own built-in volume controls as well.\nInterestingly, when you connect two devices with two different sets of volume\ncontrols, you may experience your own set of problems. For example, one of the\ntwo devices might be turned low or muted, causing you to think it\u2019s broken. Or\nworse, both devices might be turned up at the same time, causing you to\naccidentally blast your eardrums.\n\nAlways check to see if you have a separate volume control over your Bluetooth\ndevice, or if it uses the same volume controls as your phone, tablet, etc.\n\n###  Battery life\n\nOne of the biggest issues you\u2019ll face as a Bluetooth headset owner is battery\nlife. Regardless of which brand you purchase, your bluetooth will likely take\na few hours to charge.\n\nThe\n[Motorola](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004CU1VW0/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=bestprod06-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=2c1514b75275fa341a4818a15e87a192&camp=1789&creative=9325),\nat full charge, offers a 12-hour battery life. The rest of the leading\ncompetitors last anywhere from four to ten hours. But regardless of which you\nchoose, we recommend charging your device at least once a day so you get the\nmost out of the set.\n\n###  Design/comfort\n\nHuman ears simply weren\u2019t designed to hold up large pieces of plastic for long\nperiods of time. Comfort can be an issue when it comes to Bluetooth headsets.\nThe designs by\n[LG](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NW2JBYO/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=bestprod06-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=2c1514b75275fa341a4818a15e87a192&camp=1789&creative=9325),\n[Motorola](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004CU1VW0/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=bestprod06-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=2c1514b75275fa341a4818a15e87a192&camp=1789&creative=9325),\nand\n[Jabra](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004MCJBJI/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=bestprod06-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=2c1514b75275fa341a4818a15e87a192&camp=1789&creative=9325)\non our shortlist score highest when it comes to overall comfort.\n\n![](//cdn2.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/layout-\nconvert-120x120/93f7dd38eefd118793616b047d5b15b9.jpg)\n\nEXPERT TIP\n\nConcerned about comfort? The LG Tone Infinim may be the most comfortable of\nthe five headsets on our shortlist, with adjustable foam earpieces that\ncontour to the ear.\n\n* * *\n\nStaff | BestReviews\n\n##  Background noise\n\nMost devices are going to pick up some background noise. There\u2019s just no\navoiding it, especially if you\u2019re outside or in a place where there\u2019s a lot\ngoing on.\n\nThe model that comes the closest to relieving the background noise problem is\nthe\n[JETech](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00T40UK20/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=bestprod06-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=2c1514b75275fa341a4818a15e87a192&camp=1789&creative=9325),\nwhich has noise-canceling properties. Even with the JETech, however, you\u2019ll\nlikely encounter a tiny bit of background noise if you\u2019re in a place with lots\nof commotion.\n\n##  Signal\n\nAs mentioned above, signal quality can be a hassle. The signal between your\ndevice and the Bluetooth device can also be a challenge. Fortunately, many\nmanufacturers have corrected this problem over the past several years. But\nsome brands still suffer from an occasional loss of connectivity.\n\nThe Jabra WAVE is one of the few Bluetooth headsets that will connect to at\nleast two devices at a time. If you value the ability to listen to music on\none system while simultaneously taking a call on your phone, the Jabra could\nbe a good option for you.\n\n##  Delays\n\nMany cell phone carriers already have delayed responses in phone\nconversations. When it comes to Bluetooth, these delays can increase further.\n\nWhen you talk into a phone, you\u2019re basically sending your signal to a tower,\nthen to space, then back to another tower, and finally to the other person. A\nBluetooth device, no matter how good it is, adds yet another layer of delay on\ntop of that, resulting in a lag of up to three seconds. It\u2019s an annoyance that\nmay cause problems down the road.\n\n![](//cdn20.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/layout-\nconvert-120x120/5c614a53c087c72b9e59ff99e9b7efee.jpg)\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nFor optimum connectivity, check the box to see how far away the bluetooth can\nreach. Then, cut that length in half. Many consider this distance to be the\n\u201csafe zone\u201d for excellent connection between your device and your bluetooth.\n\n##  Style\n\nMost modern Bluetooth devices aren\u2019t, shall we say, discrete. When it comes to\nstyle, a lot of Bluetooth devices still look a bit clunky.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about how you look while wearing your headset, we\nrecommend you take a look at the\n[Jabra](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004MCJBJI/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=bestprod06-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=2c1514b75275fa341a4818a15e87a192&camp=1789&creative=9325)\nand\n[JETech](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00T40UK20/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=bestprod06-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=2c1514b75275fa341a4818a15e87a192&camp=1789&creative=9325)\nmodels. The sleekest of our top-pick models, they use the least amount of\nmaterials and fit comfortably around your earlobe so you can hide most of the\nplastic. And there are no bulky pieces or massive logos that make you look\nlike Uhura from Star Trek.\n\n![](//cdn10.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/layout-\nconvert-120x120/e38819ef67cbf73c2e4395c3efbf1eed.jpg)\n\nEXPERT TIP\n\nWhen it comes to style, simple is better. You don\u2019t need a ton of plastic\nsitting on your earlobe. We recommend you look for a headset that\u2019s thin and\nshort.\n\n* * *\n\nStaff | BestReviews\n\n##  Price\n\nPrices range from under **$10** to around **$100** for a Bluetooth headset.\nEach product has its own great features and potential problems.\n\n**Purchasing Tips**\n\nWe advise potential buyers to select a device with specs that accommodate\ntheir needs. That said, these tips should help anyone find a better Bluetooth\nheadset.\n\n  * Look for a device with USB ports. This will allow you to use your phone or tablet charger when you\u2019re on the go.\n  * Don\u2019t fall for claims of signals beyond 30 feet. Most Bluetooth devices have the same range and must be relatively close to work properly.\n  * If you wish to use your Bluetooth with more than one device, look for a product with multipoint connectivity. This will allow you to easily switch between devices.\n\n![](//cdn23.bestreviews.com/images/v4small/image-full-\npage-1040/0fef38fff6df0193357cba9fee8f001d.jpg)\n\nDifferent headsets are designed to serve different purposes, and their price\ntags usually reflect that.\n\n##  FAQ\n\n**Q. How do I pair my headset with my device?  \nA.** Every setup is different, but it typically works like this: you turn your\ndevice on and hear a set of tones. (The tones are the Bluetooth sending a\nsignal out to whatever devices may be active nearby.) You then choose which\ndevice you want to connect to and sync them up using the instructions.\n\n**Q. Are all devices compatible?  \nA. **The vast majority of Bluetooth devices will connect to whatever you\u2019re\nusing. (Devices with out-of-date software may be an exception to this rule.)\nSometimes you need to browse your options menus to get the devices to connect,\nbut everything should work in short order.\n\n**Q. How badly will a bluetooth headset hurt my ears?  \nA.** Theoretically, your Bluetooth headset shouldn\u2019t hurt your ears at all.\nBut everyone is different. Ear size varies, as does an individual\u2019s\nsensitivity to sound. If you purchase a headset and experience discomfort\nbeyond the first few uses, find a new pair. You shouldn\u2019t need to hurt\nyourself to make it work right.\n\n**Q. How breakable are these? Can I repair them?  \nA. **Bluetooth devices are a lot like earbuds. They\u2019re small and can take some\nbumps, but they\u2019re not indestructible. If you put them through a ton of use or\nthrow them around, they will break. We don\u2019t recommend repairing them\nyourself. Find whatever warranty comes with your device and sign up for it.\nUnless the damage is superficial or could be fixed with a cleaning, most\ncompanies with an applicable warranty will replace the product rather than\ntrying to fix it.\n\nOther Products We Considered\n\nThe BestReviews editorial team researches hundreds of products based on\nconsumer reviews, brand quality, and value.
