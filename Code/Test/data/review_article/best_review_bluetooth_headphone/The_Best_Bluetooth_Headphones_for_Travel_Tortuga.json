So whether you\u2019re an Android lover, an Apple fan, or just an audiophile\non the go, it\u2019s time to embrace the importance of Bluetooth headphones. One of\nthese days that sweet, sweet headphone jack is going to be a fond memory, and\nyou need to know which pair of bluetooth headphones, or earbuds, has the best\nbattery life, the best sound, the best fit, and features in your price range.\n\nHere\u2019s our list of the 14 Best Bluetooth and Wireless headphones and earbuds\nfor every type of traveler on every budget.\n\n## What is Bluetooth?\n\nBefore we dive into headphone reviews, it\u2019s worth describing the basics of\nBluetooth. I know you probably kind of understand what Bluetooth is (it\u2019s\ninvisible radio magic, right?), but for the rest of us, here\u2019s a super quick\nrundown of what Bluetooth technology is and which parts matter when you\u2019re\ncomparison shopping for a new set of Bluetooth headphones.\n\nAccording to the [Bluetooth\u00ae](https://www.bluetooth.com/) website (yes,\n\u201cBluetooth\u201d is a registered trademark), Bluetooth is \u201ca low-power wireless\nconnectivity technology used to stream audio, transfer data, and broadcast\ninformation between devices.\u201d Bluetooth devices use 2.4GHz (that\u2019s the same\nfrequency band as wifi) to create networks called \u201cpiconets.\u201d These\n\u201cmaster/slave\u201d networks typically operate in 1:1 pairings, so your bluetooth\nheadphones are \u201cslaved\u201d to your phone when you connect them and they do\nwhatever your phone says. Kablammo, now you understand Bluetooth. Here\u2019s the\ndifference between old Bluetooth and the new stuff.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/best-\nbluetooth-headphones-1.jpg)\n\n## Bluetooth 4.0 vs. Bluetooth 5.0\n\nNot all Bluetooth is created equal. Range, battery life, and compatibility are\nall important when choosing your bluetooth headphones. Here are some of the\nbiggest differences between Bluetooth 4.0 and the new and improved Bluetooth\n5.0.\n\n### Bluetooth 4.1\n\nOriginally developed to manage \u201cthe internet of things,\u201d Bluetooth 4.1 tech is\na little older (2013) than some of the stuff you see in Bluetooth headphones\ntoday. It\u2019s still viable, though. Bluetooth 4.1 features include:\n\n  * 24MBps speeds\n  * 300 foot coverage\n  * 2.4 to 2.485 GHz bandwidths\n\nBluetooth 4.1 is basically the first \u201cgood\u201d bluetooth, and works with most\ndevices.\n\n### Bluetooth 4.2\n\nBluetooth 4.2 came out a year later in 2014. Essentially, it has all the same\nfeatures and specs as 4.1, but with a Data Length Extension. That\u2019s fancy\nengineer talk for the ability to use low energy or low power Bluetooth for\nlonger battery life.\n\n### Bluetooth 5.0\n\nBluetooth 5.0 came out in 2016 with some solid upgrades to Bluetooth\ntechnology, specifically Low Energy (LE) advancements as well as privacy and\nsecurity upgrades. Upgrades include double the speeds \u2014 48MBps \u2014 and _triple_\nthe range \u2014 300 meters or 985 feet. While it\u2019s kind of exciting to see faster\nspeeds and increased range, those specs aren\u2019t super relevant for headphones,\nsince you\u2019re not transferring data or walking 1000 feet away from your phone.\n\nBluetooth 5.0 is a huge jump for Bluetooth speakers (range is key), but not\nheadphones. And, 5.0 Bluetooth devices aren\u2019t typically backward compatible\nwith older devices. Just something to keep an eye out for. Newer doesn\u2019t\nalways mean better. Make sure your phone can handle Bluetooth 5.0 headphones.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/best-\nbluetooth-headphones-2.jpg)\n\n## The Best Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds\n\nOk. Now that we\u2019re done with the science gobbledygook, let\u2019s look at some of\nthe best bluetooth earbuds on the market right now. Earbuds are getting\ncheaper, better, and longer lasting every year. Here are some of our\nfavorites.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bluetooth-\nAbedi.png)\n\n### Abedi Y2 Bluetooth Earbuds ($26)\n\nFor $26 you don\u2019t expect much from a pair of Bluetooth headphones, but the\n[Abedi Y2 earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/Abedi-Headphones-Earphones-\nInterface-Devices/dp/B0756DGWP4) just plain work. The design is simple,\nsturdy, and if you\u2019re looking for a pair of bluetooth earbuds you can use on a\nrun, or on the go with your phone, this is a solid contender.\n\nFeaturing a neck cable with remote buttons and a microphone, these earbuds are\nmagnetic so you can stick them together and wear them around your neck when\nthey\u2019re not in your ears. That sounds like a small thing, but for a biker\n(like me) or a traveler, the ability to take your buds in and out of your ears\nwithout losing them is\n\na big deal. They also have a silicone ear hook to wrap around your ear so they\nwon\u2019t fall out in transit.\n\nThe Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity is compatible with just about everything, the\nsound is decent, the design is solid and the build quality is a lot higher\nthan the price suggests. This set of earbuds has over 900 5-star reviews which\nis crazy for notoriously glitchy Bluetooth earbuds. Pick \u2019em up and see if\nBluetooth is for you.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bluetooth-\nbose-sound-sport.png)\n\n### Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones ($99)\n\nIf sound quality is what you\u2019re after, the [BOSE SoundSport Wireless\nHeadphones](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/earphones/soundsport-\nwireless.html) are for you. Built with Bose\u2019s insane EQ technology, these\nearbuds sound like headphones. They\u2019re sweat and weather resistant (not\nwaterproof, but you know), and boast a 6-hour listening time. The battery\nlife, honestly, isn\u2019t the best in-class, but the sound quality more than makes\nup for it.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bluetooth-\nbose-soundsport-free.png)\n\n### Bose Soundsport Free ($249)\n\nIf you want to ditch the wires completely, jump up to the [Bose Soundsport\nFree](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/earphones/soundsport-\nfree-wireless.html). They\u2019re weather-resistant, pack a 5-hour charge (with an\nextra 10 hours if you count the charging/carrying case), and just plain out-\nperform a lot of other\n\nbluetooth earbuds. [Patrick Healy](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/how-i-\ntravel-patrick-healy/), a member of our Tortuga design team, swears by these:\n_\u201cFor the most part, I love them. I tried a few other options and these sound\nthe best by far. My biggest issue with them is that they stick too far out of\nyour ears.\u201d_\n\nIf you can make your peace with a slightly bulky feel, you\u2019re gonna like these\nearbuds on the road.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bluetooth-\nasakuki.png)\n\n### Asakuki Bluetooth Sport Earbuds ($49)\n\nThe [Asakuki Bluetooth Sport Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/Sweatproof-\nEarphones-Headphones-Cancellation-ASAKUKI/dp/B073SS15RJ) might be my favorite\ntravel-friendly wireless earbuds. They\u2019re \u201c100% sweatproof\u201d so they can handle\njust about anything the road can throw at them. The 6mm speaker (that\u2019s\nactually pretty great for earbuds) and \u201cbinaural mode\u201d lets you get that rich\nstereo left/right channel thing going for more dynamic music \u201caround\u201d your\near. It\u2019s a subtle difference in quality, but one that I appreciate.\n\nSimple touch controls and Bluetooth 4.2 compatibility mean they\u2019re easy to use\n\nright out of the box, and the carrying case packs enough juice to charge them\nthree times without recharging the case, not to mention the 300 hours of\nstandby charge. Perfectly designed, perfectly priced, and perfectly equipped\nto take on the road. These are a great pair of travel bluetooth earbuds.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bluetooth-\naukey.png)\n\n### Aukey Running Wireless Earbuds ($19)\n\nDesigned for runners, the [Aukey wireless running\nearbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074DWSSLD/ref=pd_luc_rh_sbs_02_01_t_img_lh?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)\nmake a great pair of travel headphones. Featuring a slim neckband with volume\ncontrols and mic, (so you don\u2019t lose them on a bumpy bus ride), and magnetic\nearbuds that \u201cclip\u201d together to allow for casual wearing when you\u2019re not\nlistening, these small, light, easy to use earbuds pack a decent punch.\nSeriously, they only weigh 0.78 ounces. That\u2019s nuts.\n\nThe 10mm speakers deliver powerful balanced sound, and the 8-hour battery life\nis impressive, especially considering the short 2-hour charge time. These\nearbuds are built for heavy use in practically any travel scenario for a price\nany traveler can afford.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bluetooth-\naukey-latitude.png)\n\n### Aukey Latitude Wireless Headphones ($29)\n\nIf you want to upgrade from the Aukey Running earbuds, our marketing wizard,\nTaylor Coil recommends the [Aukey Latitude wireless\nheadphones](https://www.amazon.com/AUKEY-Headphones-Bluetooth-Sweat-Resistant-\nMore-Black/dp/B06ZZSQQTD).\n\n_\u201cThey charge super fast, last eight hours, and they\u2019re comfortable in my\nears.\u201d_ She admits that the _\u201csound quality isn\u2019t amazing,\u201d_ but like a true\ntraveler, she _\u201ccares less about that when I\u2019m on the train, on a run or\nlistening to a podcast.\u201d_\n\nQuality is relative, and nothing beats a pair of travel-friendly earbuds you\ncan beat up on the road.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bluetooth-\nairpods.png)\n\n### Apple AirPods ($159)\n\nOk. We\u2019re gonna do it. Here we go. It\u2019s time to talk about the [Apple\nAirPods](https://www.apple.com/airpods/). *Deep breath.*\n\nThe AirPods are one of the more polarizing bluetooth earbuds around. Some\npeople love the look and feel, others can\u2019t stand it. Some balk at the price\ntag,\n\nothers love the seamless IOS integration at any price. Whichever camp you\u2019re\nin, the Apple earbuds are some of the most expensive wireless earbud options\navailable, but for good reason.\n\nDesigned for seamless use, the AirPods can sense when they\u2019re in your ears and\nwhen they\u2019re not, meaning you don\u2019t have to do anything\u2014they just work. They\ncan even be used just one at a time. Integrated with Siri and voice command,\nthe Apple W1 chip means better connectivity which ultimately means better\nbattery life (up to 5 hours). Even the case is designed to keep you listening,\nwith more than 24 hours of listening time in a single case charge and the\nability to charge your Pods with enough juice for 3 hours of listening time in\njust 15 minutes.\n\nBoth of our co-founders, Fred Perotta and Jeremy Cohen, rep the AirPods,\nalthough I think Jeremy likes them a little bit more:\n\n_\u201cThe Apple AirPods are incredible,\u201d_ claims Jeremy. _\u201cAside from the iPhone,\nthey\u2019re the best piece of consumer electronics I\u2019ve ever owned.\u201d_\n\nSo take that, Android. Maybe these earbuds are worth every penny.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/best-\nbluetooth-headphones-3.jpg)\n\n## Best On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones\n\nIf sound quality and battery life are really important to you, then over-ear,\nor on-ear (they\u2019re different), bluetooth is the only way to go. On-ear\nbluetooth headphones aren\u2019t as light and travel friendly as the earbuds, but\nwhat they lack in portability, they more than make up in sound quality, noise\ncancelling features, comfort, and battery life. Sometimes bigger is better.\nHere are some of the best on-ear wireless headphones.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bluetooth-\nsennheiser.png)\n\n### [Sennheiser HD1 On-Ear Wireless Headphones\n($400)](https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD1-Wireless-Headphones-\nCancellation/dp/B01N7UBGGQ)\n\nSennheiser is one of the best names in audio, and the [Sennheiser HD1 on-ear\nwireless headphones](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/hd1-on-ear-wireless-\nheadphones-with-mic) are no exception. Outfitted with NoiseGard hybrid active\nnoise cancellation, these headphones feature four microphones to ensure that\nyou can block out the outside world on your next flight. Also crammed with a\nfull 22 hour battery life, they fold down, making it a travel-friendly (if a\nlittle large) bluetooth headset.\n\nThe kicker here is quality. These are high-end bluetooth headphones for people\nthat care about sound quality and reliability. The mic in the base of the\nheadphones picks up your voice for Skype calls and phone calls but works to\ncancel out other sound you don\u2019t want to hear. And the on-ear design means\nthat you can comfortably wear them without smothering your ears like over-ear\nheadphones. They don\u2019t engulf your ears, but they block out sound. Also, these\nheadphones feature Bluetooth 4.0 tech and NFC so they\u2019re much more likely to\npair with all your devices. Plus, they come with a cable if you want to use\nthem on your home computer without worrying about battery life.\n\n$400 is a hefty price tag, but you pay for the best. Plus, these headphones\nroutinely go on sale. During Cyber Monday 2017, they were on sale for $249. So\nthat\u2019s great. Keep your ears peeled for a sale and snag these platinum\nbluetooth headphones.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bluetooth-\nsony.png)\n\n### Sony WH1000XM2 Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones ($298)\n\nWhen it comes to audio quality, Sony is always going to be part of the\nconversation. The [Sony WH1000XM2 noise cancelling wireless\nheadphones](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH1000XM2-Cancelling-Wireless-\nHeadphones/dp/B074KDJVS2) are more than just wireless. Ergonomically designed\nwith your comfort in mind, they feature stuff like a touch sensor on the right\near cup. Simply swipe with your finger to skip songs, change the volume or\nanswer calls. Oh, and these headphones feature a **_30-hour battery life_**\nand a quick charging option that allows for 70 minutes of play time after a\n10-minute charge. But the best feature has to be the noise cancelling tech.\n\nSony Smart Listening automatically adjusts to your environment so you only\nhear what you want. If that\u2019s not enough, you can change the ambient listening\nsettings via the Sony app to your preferences (ideal if you need to hear your\nboarding announcement then block out the white noise of the flight).\n\nAt just 9 ounces, the Sony wireless headphones are perfect for travelers and\nmusic nerds alike. Top-quality audio features, intuitive touch gestures, and\ncrazy long battery life mean these headphones will go the distance and sound\ngood doing it. And, it comes with a cord to attach to your home system or in-\nflight movie if you want to save that battery life for later.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bluetooth-\nJLab.png)\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bluetooth-\nJLAB-bud.png)\n\n### JLab Audio OMNI Over-Ear Headphones ($99)\n\nOur social media and partnership guru, Angela Rollins, just plain \u201cloves\u201d her\n[JLab Audio OMNI over-ear bluetooth\nheadphones](https://www.jlabaudio.com/products/omni-folding-bluetooth-over-\near-headphone) and it\u2019s not hard to see why. They feature plush leather and\ncomfortable cloud memory foam padding in a travel-friendly folding design, but\nthe 15-hour battery life is the real takeaway. That\u2019s three times better than\nApple AirPods, and way above industry standard for most over-ear headphones.\nBut everyone is different.\n\nFor instance, Angela doesn\u2019t recommend the [JLab bluetooth\nearbuds](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/how-i-travel-patrick-healy/):\n\n_\u201cI got JLab bluetooth earbuds and found them difficult to use. The thing that\nkeeps it on your ear is one of those around the ear things but it\u2019s a wire\nthat you have to bend to exactly the right shape and I could never get it\nright \u2014 or once I did it would get bent out of shape at some point. One of the\nbuds also stopped producing sound after under a year \u2014 which is how I ended up\nwith my over the ear headphones.\u201d_\n\nHowever, our Customer Service Concierge, Lauren Tennant swears by these\nearbuds:\n\n_\u201cI have and LOVE the[ JLab Audio Epic Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Sports\nEarbuds](https://www.jlabaudio.com/products/epic2-bluetooth-wireless-sport-\nearbuds). They\u2019re comfy, they charge quickly, they last a long time, [10\nhours] and the cord doesn\u2019t get in the way.\u201d_\n\nPicking the right pair of bluetooth headphones often comes down to preference.\nSometimes bulkier is better, and sometimes earbuds are the way to go. Don\u2019t be\nafraid to try a few and see what you like.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bluetooth-\nLabvon.png)\n\n### Labvon Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones ($39)\n\nThe [Labvon wireless noise cancelling\nheadphones](https://www.amazon.com/Labvon-Cancelling-Headphones-Lightweight-\nSensitivity/dp/B0775TCN7R) are a great budget alternative to the pricey\nBluetooth headphones out there. Featuring a lot of the same specs as the big\nboys \u2014 Bluetooth 4.1, connectivity range of 33 feet, noise cancelling and\nbuilt-in microphone \u2014 Labvon is a great travel-friendly Bluetooth over ear\noption. The 300mAh battery (that\u2019s about 1/10 of a [portable\ncharger](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/best-external-battery-packs/)) means\nyou\u2019ll get about 8 hours of listening time and about 10 hours of talk time, so\nthey\u2019ll work for that long flight. Not perfect, but pretty great for the\nprice.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bluetooth-\nmpow-thor.png)\n\n### Mpow Thor Bluetooth Headphones On Ear ($25)\n\nAnother great budget friendly bluetooth headphone option are the [Mpow Thor\nBluetooth on-ear headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-\nWireless-Portable/dp/B06XKLRLP2). The soft memory foam headset, 40mm aperture\ndriver, and 8 hour battery life are all solid features for this light (11\nounce) travel friendly headset option. Certainly not the best bluetooth\nheadphones on the planet, but the sheer volume and balance available in these\non-ear headphones are more than enough for the traveling audiophile.\n\n![](http://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bluetooth-\nenjoybot-beanie.png)\n\n### [Enjoybot Bluetooth Beanie ($25)](https://www.amazon.com/Enjoybot-\nBluetooth-Wireless-Speakers-Microphone/dp/B074T8JTK4)\n\nWant some really over-ear bluetooth headphones? Why not just ditch the\nheadphones altogether and get the [Enjoybot Bluetooth\nBeanie](https://www.amazon.com/Enjoybot-Bluetooth-Wireless-Speakers-\nMicrophone/dp/B074TBG4QR). This wool knit cap comes with all the wireless\nfeatures and sound quality of headsets without the headsets. What\u2019s crazy is\nthat this hat isn\u2019t just some awesome looking gimmick. The bluetooth beanie\nfeatures a 6-hour playtime (above average), and a 60-hour standby battery life\nso you don\u2019t have to worry about charging this up all the time. The simple\nbutton controls on the edge of the hat actually work, and this hat even has a\nmicrophone so you can take calls _with your hat_.\n\nMachine washable (just remove the controls), and comfy as heck, this Bluetooth\nheadphone beanie is kind of amazing. Best part: if the batteries die, you\nstill have a sweet hat. Suck it, headphones.\n\n## TL;DR\n\nBluetooth headphones and earbuds are all about simplicity and portability. Cut\nthe cord and embrace Bluetooth. Just make sure you prioritize the features\nthat matter to you:\n\n  * Bluetooth 5.0 is faster and stronger than Bluetooth 4.1 and 4.2 but it\u2019s not always compatible with every device (especially older phones)\n  * Range doesn\u2019t matter, you weirdo\n  * 5 hours of battery life is the bare minimum; anything less is going to piss you off\n  * 10mm is a good sized speaker for earbuds, but can\u2019t match the sound quality of on-ear headphones\n  * Find the features that matter most to you and ignore the reviews that don\u2019t address your favorite things\n\nAnd if you just can\u2019t make the leap to bluetooth, just get the [Apple\ndongle](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMX62AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-\nheadphone-jack-adapter). I mean\u2026 it can\u2019t look that stupid, right?\n\n### Want more like this?\n\nGet weekly gear reviews, travel hacks, and packing tips sent straight to your\ninbox.
