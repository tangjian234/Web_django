You're not just getting freedom from\nwires here, but amazing noise cancelation, sound, comfort, and features too.\nMultiple Reviewed staff used these over a period of month, and all of us\nabsolutely loved them.\n\nOf course, all that quality ends up reflected in the price, and as is usually\nthe case with our Best Overall products. However, if you'll settle for nothing\nbut the best in a new pair of wireless headphones, the WH-1000XM3 are the ones\nto set your sights on. Given their blue-ribbon marks in every aspect of\nperformance, comfort, and features, we think they're well worth it.\n\nThat said, if you just want to be free of wires, there's a lot of extra tech\nhere you might not want to pay for: class-leading noise cancelation, for one,\nand some of the best sound we heard back in 2019.

In our testing, the Elite Active 65t performed similarly to\nthe standard Elite 65t: mostly distortion-free sound with great isolation and\na fair amount of \u201coomph\u201d on the low end, all for a great price.\n\nThey're not perfect, of course: wee had some mild connectivity issues. We\nsometimes found ourselves needing to remove the Elite Active 65t from our\nphone or computer\u2019s saved devices list and re-establish a connection, which\ncan be difficult since a long press on the earbud\u2019s play button controls both\nthe earbuds\u2019 Bluetooth signal _and_ the power.\n\nThat said, if you're just looking for a solid pair of wireless headphones that\nwon't break the bank, the Jabra Elite Active 65t sound great, stand up to the\nelements, and offer desirable features. As such, we think they\u2019re a great\nvalue, especially if you\u2019re planning on running or working out at the gym.\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * Excellent sound \n\n  * Workout ready \n\n#### Cons\n\n  * Bluetooth issues \n\n  * Some sound artifacts \n\n[ $67.98 from Amazon\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07BHF993Q%3Ftag%3Dreviewedcom03-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1?gen=unspecified&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n[ $139.99 from Best Buy\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F50053%2F633495%2F10014%3Fprodsku%3D6296201%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fapi.bestbuy.com%252Fclick%252F-%252F6296201%252Fpdp%26intsrc%3DAPIG_4831?gen=unspecified&retailer=bestbuy&source=bestbuy)\n[ $112.99 from Walmart\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F50053%2F568844%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26prodsku%3D225985740%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252F225985740?gen=unspecified&retailer=walmart&source=walmart)\n[ $139.99 from Lenovo\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fknl.mntzrlt.net%2Fshop-\nrest%2Fapi%2Ftrack%2Fv2%2F1049%2F5%2F9782%3Foi%3D5801906607%26xp%3D11%26mk%3DUSD_EN%26tu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.lenovo.com%252Fus%252Fen%252Faccessories-\nand-monitors%252Faudio%252Fheadphones%252FJABRA-ELITE-ACTIVE-65T-COPPER-\nACCS%252Fp%252F78011599?gen=unspecified&retailer=lenovo&source=skimlinks)\n\n## Related content\n\n  * ![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--nMQsOdLc--/b_white,c_fill,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_xy_center,h_150,q_1,w_200,x_1675,y_1419/https://reviewed-production.s3.amazonaws.com/1585863864009/best-streaming-services.jpg)\n\n####  ![](/packs/media/images/icon-\nexclamation-859a51cf17b617432be0b49db97b8488.svg) best-right-now\n\n[ The Best Music Streaming Services of 2020\n](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/best-right-now/the-best-music-streaming-\nservices)\n\n  * ![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--ikkULOHx--/b_white,c_fill,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_200/https://reviewed-production.s3.amazonaws.com/1583156527913/Apple-AirPods-Pro-hero-cropped3.jpg)\n\n####  ![](/packs/media/images/icon-\nexclamation-859a51cf17b617432be0b49db97b8488.svg) best-right-now\n\n[ The Best Wireless Earbuds of 2020\n](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/best-right-now/the-best-true-wireless-\nearbuds)\n\n## How We Tested\n\n![head_and_torso_simulator](https://reviewed-com-\nres.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nzNjF5hUF--/b_white,c_limit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,q_1,w_792/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/attachment/2aa0d474ce3c4db4/HATS.JPG)\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Julia MacDougall\n\nWe test all of our headphones on a head and torso simulator (HATS), a model of\na human being from the waist upwards that reproduces how we experience music\nwhen we listen to headphones.\n\n### The Testers\n\nReviewed has been testing and reviewing personal and home audio products for\nover a decade, and our staff is peopled with passionate music-lovers,\nmusicians, and (reasonable) audiophiles.\n\nOur staff and freelancers\u2014whether based in Cambridge, Mass., or\nremotely\u2014evaluate each set of headphones on the same merits that anyone would\nat home: comfort, usability, design, sound quality, and so on. We also bring\nthem into our headphone lab, where we use a head-and-torso simulator to test\nthem scientifically. All in all, we take a holistic objective and subjective\nlook at a pair of headphones backed by ample experience.\n\n### The Tests\n\nOn our head and torso simulator (HATS), we put these headphones through our\nusual battery of headphone tests: [frequency\nresponse](https://www.reviewed.com/science/headphone-science-frequency-\nresponse), [distortion](https://www.reviewed.com/science/how-we-test-\nheadphones-distortion), [tracking, leakage, and\nisolation](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/science/how-we-test-\nheadphones).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHeadphone manufacturers are typically aiming for either a flat or a curved\nsound profile. A curved profile is most common, and most curved profiles are\ntrying to replicate the Equal Loudness Curve (ELC). The human ear hears higher\ntones more easily than it hears the bass tones, so for a human to perceive\nhighs and lows at a similar volume, the headphones boost the volume of the\nlows, and moderate the volume of the highs.\n\nA flat profile is usually found in \"studio\" headphones; the highs, mids, and\nbass tones have the same volume. However, as I just mentioned, we don't hear\nall tones at the same volume, so the bass notes sound softer, and the highs\nsound louder. Some people prefer studio headphones because of their audio\nfidelity\u2014they are hearing the music exactly as the producers intended them to\nhear it. Also, as implied by the name, studio headphones are used in studio\nrecordings to help mixers figure out what, if any frequencies, they should\nboost or reduce.\n\nIn addition to the more scientific testing, we also wear each pair of\nheadphones around town to get a sense for their features (like extra amps or\nnoise cancellation) and short- and long-term comfort.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## What You Should Know About Headphones\n\nYou've probably seen a bunch of different headphones in your everyday life,\nbut what you may not realize is that headphones, while they have a number of\ndifferent selling points, are primarily categorized into three types: in-ear,\non-ear, and over-ear.\n\n![different_headphone_types](https://reviewed-com-\nres.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nxFGzGzZD--/b_white,c_limit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,q_1,w_792/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/attachment/23977c636d3246c0/headphone-types.jpg)\n\nCredit: Reviewed\n\nThree popular types of headphones: in-ear, on-ear, and over-ear.\n\nKnowing the basic terminology of modern headphones is the best way to estimate\nwhat you need (or want) in a pair of headphones, which will guide you towards\ndeciding how much to spend. Usually, if you have an idea of what style you're\nlooking for, what features you want or need, and how you'll be using your new\nheadphones, you can start to estimate how much you want to spend. For example,\nSony's [super-popular WH-1000XM3\nheadphones](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/content/sony-\nwh-1000xm3-review) are Bluetooth (wireless) over-ears with Adaptive Noise\nCanceling. If you're not sure what all that means, read on to see which pair\nis right for you.\n\n### How To Choose The Best Wireless Headphones\n\n  * **Style** : Deciding on one of the three common form factors\u2014in-ear, on-ear, or over-ear\u2014should be your first step. Generally, in-ear headphones are the most portable and convenient, over-ear headphones are the most comfortable, while on-ear headphones are somewhere in between. [Check out our guide to the pros and cons of each form factor](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/features/what-kind-of-headphones-should-you-buy).\n\n![headphone-ear-pads](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nRDQNe-S5--/b_white,c_limit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,q_1,w_792/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/attachment/ad2f506065674b1b/headphone-ear-\npads.jpg)\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser\n\nSelecting a style of headphone comes down to many factors, including comfort,\nportability, and stylishness.\n\n  * **Bluetooth/wireless** : Do you want wireless headphones? A pair of Bluetooth headphones will let you go completely without wires, while a set of \"true wireless\" earbuds are even more minimalist. If you're looking for an experience that won't tether you to your phone, tablet, or laptop, Bluetooth headphones are what you need\u2014and fortunately, they're ubiquitous enough these days that you can find them in every style and price range. \n\n  * **Noise-canceling** : Noise-canceling headphones, originally designed for pilots, aren't just for frequent flyers anymore. These headphones reduce the volume of ambient noise around you, and over the last several years they've become a mainstay for travelers, public transit commuters, gym-goers, and even people in extra-chatty offices. If you already know you're looking for noise canceling headphones, [check out the best ones we've tested](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/best-right-now/best-noise-canceling-headphones).\n\n  * **Open-backed** : Last but not least, this niche kind of over-ear headphone is a style that's especially preferred by people mixing and matstering audio. Unlike traditional \"closed-back\" headphones, open-backed headphones have, literally, open backs, allowing some of the sound to escape into the room around you. While these headphones are primarily meant for audio professionals and audiophiles, it's worth knowing about them even if it's so you can decide if they're something you want or not.\n\n* * *\n\n## Other Wireless Headphones We Tested\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nV3vcoSNp--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_150/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1573241852863/Apple-airpods-pro.jpg)\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\ni3ff333t--/b_white,c_limit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,q_1,w_972/https://reviewed-\ncom-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nts4bj2wC--/b_white%2Cc_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive.strip_profile%2Cg_center%2Ch_122%2Cq_auto%2Cw_104/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1567516076953/editors-choice.png)\n\nApple AirPods Pro\n\n[Apple's AirPods Pro](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/content/apple-\nairpods-pro-review-the-best-wireless-earbuds-yet) are the meaningful upgrade\nof the [original AirPods](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/features/i-hate-\nthat-i-love-apples-true-wireless-earbuds) we've all been waiting for. New\nfeatures include better sound, good noise cancellation, moderate water-\nresistance and easily swappable silicone tips, meaning they should fit better\nfor more people.\n\nAt just 4.5 to 5 hours per charge, battery life is middling, but the tiny\nportable charging case offers 4-5 full recharges and can give you an hour of\nlistening time in just five minutes. Noise cancellation matched up well with\npricier noise-canceling headphones in lab testing, with only a half-hour lost\nin battery life when engaged.\n\nAt their original $250 price point, they're not exactly cheap, but they offer\nenough of a meaningful difference that we think it's worth it. That's\nespecially true since their intuitive and comfortable design means they are\nextremely versatile; these can be your primary headphones for hitting the gym,\nwork, or travel.\n\nAlong with their noise cancellation, their transparency mode\u2014which filters in\nexterior audio\u2014allows you to hear listen just as easily indoors our out. In\naddition, thanks to noise-canceling signal processing for the microphones,\ncall quality is among the best you'll find. The AirPods Pro are a massive win\nfor Apple, standing as some of the best wireless earbuds on the market,\nperiod.\n\n[Check out the full review\nhere.](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/content/apple-airpods-pro-review-\nthe-best-wireless-earbuds-yet)\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * Active noise cancellation \n\n  * Silicon tips ensure a more comfortable fit \n\n  * Easy setup and syncing \n\n#### Cons\n\n  * Sub-par audio quality, given their price \n\n[ $211.55 from Amazon\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07ZPC9QD4%3Ftag%3Dreviewedcom03-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1?gen=unspecified&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n[ $249.99 from Best Buy\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F50053%2F633495%2F10014%3Fprodsku%3D5706659%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fapi.bestbuy.com%252Fclick%252F-%252F5706659%252Fpdp%26intsrc%3DAPIG_4831?gen=unspecified&retailer=bestbuy&source=bestbuy)\n[ $234.00 from Walmart\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F50053%2F568844%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26prodsku%3D520468661%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252F520468661?gen=unspecified&retailer=walmart&source=walmart)\n[ $249.99 from Target\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F50053%2F201333%2F2092%3Fprodsku%3D54191101%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.target.com%252Fp%252Fapple-\nairpods-\npro%252F-%252FA-54191101%26intsrc%3DAPIG_1444?gen=unspecified&retailer=target&source=target)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nBTesKxnG--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_150/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1539967350347/017817770613.jpg)\n\nBose QuietComfort 35 II\n\nBose's QuietComfort 35s were one of the first superstar sets of noise-\ncanceling headphones on the market, so it makes sense that the follow-up, the\nQuietComfort 35 Series II, is equally renowned. Their active noise\ncancellation (ANC) reduces a huge range of noises, making them ideal for\nanyone dealing with particularly noise situations. Naturally, they're also\nwireless\u2014sporting an excellent 20 hours of battery life\u2014but the reason most\npeople buy these headphones is for their noise canceling.\n\nThere's still a lot to love about the QC 35 IIs, however. They're lightweight\nand comfortable enough for all-day use, and the Series II edition also adds\nGoogle Assistant integration. While we prefer Sony's WH-1000XM3 in general,\nthere's no denying that the QC 35 IIs are a serious runner-up where noise\ncanceling, sound quality, and overall comfort are concerned. And as it stands,\nwe still prefer these to Bose's newer NC 700 model.\n\nHowever, like the Sony WH-1000XM3, you're paying a good bit more here for all\nthe fancy, extra features, so if you're just looking for a great wireless\noption and don't want/need to pay for everything the QC 35 IIs offer, check\nout some of the more affordable options further down the list.\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * Light & comfortable \n\n  * Outstanding noise cancellation \n\n  * Works with Google Assistant \n\n#### Cons\n\n  * Expensive \n\n[ $169.99 from Amazon\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0756CYWWD%3Ftag%3Dreviewedcom03-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1?gen=unspecified&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n[ $299.00 from Walmart\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F50053%2F568844%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26prodsku%3D602445423%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252F602445423?gen=unspecified&retailer=walmart&source=walmart)\n[ $299.00 from Abt\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-7049598-13489155-1594740829206%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.abt.com%252Fproduct%252F115154%252FBose-\nBlack-QuietComfort-35-Wireless-Headphones-\nII-7895640010.html%26cjsku%3D115154?gen=unspecified&retailer=abt&source=abt) [\n$299.00 from B&H\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fknl.mntzrlt.net%2Fshop-\nrest%2Fapi%2Ftrack%2Fv2%2F1049%2F5%2F11159%3Foi%3D5376300851%26xp%3D11%26mk%3DUSD_EN%26tu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%252Fc%252Fproduct%252F1351454-REG%252Fbose_qc35s2_quietcomfort_35_series_ii.html?gen=unspecified&retailer=bh&source=skimlinks)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nWO7Fvj4S--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_150/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1565004090859/Sony-WF-1000XM3.jpg)\n\nSony WF-1000XM3\n\nThe WF-1000XM3 are meant to be the true wireless version of our top-rated\nWH-1000XM3 headphones, and they live up to the name. While their price is\nhigh, they deliver the goods when it comes to their two biggest features:\nsound quality and noise cancellation. If those are the features you care about\nmost instead of, say, a pair you can use to sweat to the oldies at the gym,\nthese could be your best 'buds (apologies for the pun).\n\nWhile their lack of water resistance and bulbous design aren't for rugged\nexcursions, the WF-1000XM3 make up for it with a truckload of features,\nincluding transparency mode (so you can hear the world around you), adjustable\nEQ, and other add-ons that are adjustable via Sony's Headphones Connect app.\n\nThey also offer solid battery life that outdoes Apple's AirPods Pro, including\n6 hours with noise canceling and 8 hours without it, along with multiple\nrecharges in the case. Pair that with some of the best sound in the genre and\ntravel-ready noise canceling and you can see why we keep recommending the\nWF-1000XM3 to those looking for a sophisticated take on true wireless.\n\n[Check out our full review\nhere.](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/content/sony-wf-1000xm3-true-\nwireless-headphones-review)\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * Great sound quality \n\n  * Solid battery life \n\n  * Class-leading ANC \n\n#### Cons\n\n  * Not water-resistant \n\n  * Finicky controls \n\n[ $100.35 from Amazon\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07TD96LY2%3Ftag%3Dreviewedcom03-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1?gen=unspecified&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n[ $178.00 from Walmart\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F50053%2F568844%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26prodsku%3D523676617%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252F523676617?gen=unspecified&retailer=walmart&source=walmart)\n[ $179.99 from Target\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F50053%2F201333%2F2092%3Fprodsku%3D76506556%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.target.com%252Fp%252Fsony-\ntrue-wireless-headphones-black-\nwf1000xm3-b%252F-%252FA-76506556%26intsrc%3DAPIG_1444?gen=unspecified&retailer=target&source=target)\n[ $178.00 from Abt\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-7049598-13489155-1594740825968%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.abt.com%252Fproduct%252F137579%252FSony-\nBlack-Noise-Canceling-Truly-Wireless-Earbuds-\nWF1000XM3B.html%26cjsku%3D137579?gen=unspecified&retailer=abt&source=abt)\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nH5cBxPT5--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_150/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1586463397344/Jabra-Elite-Active-75t.jpg)\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\ni3ff333t--/b_white,c_limit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,q_1,w_972/https://reviewed-\ncom-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nts4bj2wC--/b_white%2Cc_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive.strip_profile%2Cg_center%2Ch_122%2Cq_auto%2Cw_104/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1567516076953/editors-choice.png)\n\nJabra Elite Active 75t\n\nThe [Jabra Elite Active\n75t](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/content/jabra-elite-\nactive-75t-review) are a fantastic set of wireless \u2019buds for just about\nanyone, but particularly suitable for folks who spend time running or working\nout, thanks to IP57-rated water and dust resistance.\n\nYou're getting all the great true wireless features you might want, save for\nnoise cancelation.

Sound Labs PuroQuiet Kids Headphones\n\nThe [Puro Sound Labs PuroQuiet\nKids](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/content/puro-sound-labs-puroquiet-\nkids-headphones-review) headphones are\u2014you guessed it\u2014made specifically with\nyoung ears in mind. We loved the previous iteration (the Puro BT2200), and the\nPuroQuiet Kids may up the price a little, but it justifies it by adding one\nvery key feature: noise cancellation. While these might seem a bit luxurious\nto buy for a lot of kids, they're an especially good choice for children who\nmight struggle with sensory filtering.\n\nOn the plus side, no matter the child, the noise cancelation here can help\nstymie the desire to crank the volume up. And that's good, because these are\nalready volume limited\u2014a critical element of protecting your child's hearing,\nbut we can understand wanting it to _seem_ louder, too. Rather than needing to\nturn them up to drown out outside noise, they can simply use the noise\ncanceling feature.\n\nThe only real drawback with these wireless, specialized noise canceling\nheadphones is their price, but if you want to make sure your kid's hearing is\nprotected while they jam out, they're well worth it. Puro also frequently puts\nthese on sale, making it a slightly more friendly investment for ear-conscious\nparents.\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * Cuts ambient noise with no technical issues \n\n  * Safe for up to 8 hours \n\n  * Tangle-free \n\n#### Cons\n\n  * Very expensive \n\n[ $99.99 from Puro Sound Labs\n](http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=83224X1534997&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reviewed.com%2Fheadphones%2Fbest-\nright-now%2Fthe-best-wireless-\nheadphones&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffave.co%2F2uWknE8&xs=1?gen=&retailer=purosoundlabs&source=)\n[ $99.99 from Amazon\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07JHCRNF5%3Ftag%3Dreviewedcom03-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1?gen=unspecified&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nVMOYxQXG--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_150/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1572547297939/61yKNXIjxQL._SL1500_.jpg)\n\nPowerbeats Pro\n\nAvailable in a stylish range of colors\u2014ivory, black, navy, or moss\u2014the\nPowerbeats Pro are a solid true wireless option that fulfill a lot of what we\nwant in these kinds of headphones. Their specific angle is to be great for use\nduring workouts (or at least better than the average true wireless fare), and\nthey pull it off via adjustable earhooks, comfortable materials, and\nsweat/water resistance.\n\nOf course, as you'd hopefully expect for the price you're paying, the\nPowerbeats Pro also sound great, offering the same strong bass and midtone\npresence that Beats by Dre headphones have worked to encapsulate over the\nyears. Like other true wireless options, you're getting tiny, compact ear buds\nand a pocketable charging case, which all together offers respectable battery\nlife.\n\nHowever, there are some drawbacks here. For this price, you're not getting\nnoise canceling like you are with the Apple AirPods Pro, but you're paying\nconsiderably more than you would for the regular AirPods, or even something\nlike the Samsung Galaxy Buds+. While we think the Powerbeats Pro are worth the\nprice, we also think they'll appeal to a specific subset of buyers looking for\na particular combination of use during exercise and stylish design details.\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * Water-resistant \n\n  * Available in a number of colors \n\n  * Long battery life \n\n#### Cons\n\n  * Bass-forward sound not for everyone \n\n  * Ear hooks can be uncomfortable \n\n[ $157.26 from Amazon\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07R5QD598%3Ftag%3Dreviewedcom03-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1?gen=unspecified&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n[ $249.99 from Best Buy\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F50053%2F633495%2F10014%3Fprodsku%3D6341988%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fapi.bestbuy.com%252Fclick%252F-%252F6341988%252Fpdp%26intsrc%3DAPIG_4831?gen=unspecified&retailer=bestbuy&source=bestbuy)\n[ $249.95 from Walmart\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F50053%2F568844%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26prodsku%3D128591554%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252F128591554?gen=unspecified&retailer=walmart&source=walmart)\n[ $249.99 from Target\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F50053%2F201333%2F2092%3Fprodsku%3D54610898%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.target.com%252Fp%252Fpowerbeats-\npro-true-wireless-in-ear-eardphones-\nblack%252F-%252FA-54610898%26intsrc%3DAPIG_1444?gen=unspecified&retailer=target&source=target)\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nI5sFvp-2--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_150/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1557918587399/audio-technica-ath-anc900bt.jpg)\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\ni3ff333t--/b_white,c_limit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,q_1,w_972/https://reviewed-\ncom-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nts4bj2wC--/b_white%2Cc_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive.strip_profile%2Cg_center%2Ch_122%2Cq_auto%2Cw_104/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1567516076953/editors-choice.png)\n\nAudio-Technica ATH-ANC900BT\n\nAudio-Technica's most premium wireless headphones at present, the ATH-ANC900BT\ndo their best to deliver the same amazing suite of features as our top-rated\nSony WH-1000XM3. And while they don't quite succeed, they come pretty close,\nand are an awesome choice if you want great noise-canceling wireless over-ears\nfor a little less money.\n\nWhile the ATH-ANC900BT's deliver a reliable, flat audio response with decent\nbass preservation, their strongest foot forward might actually be their\nbattery life. Compared to our top-rated WH-1000XM3, which gives you just shy\nof 24 hours on a single charge, the ANC900BT's give you closer to 40. They're\nnot as comfortable, and the bigger battery adds heft that you'll feel on your\nhead and neck, but if you've been hunting for a set of wireless, noise-\ncanceling cans that will last for an entire week's worth of commuting between\ncharges, these are the way to go.\n\nLike many other Audio-Technica Bluetooth headphones, the drawback with these\nis that their connection can be a bit dodgy. Putting your phone into your\npocket may result in more slight but noticeable audio skipping compared to\nother models in this price range. But if you can stand a less polished\nexperience, the ATH-ANC900BT's do a pretty great job of everything else. They\ncan't touch the WH-1000XM3's in terms of noise canceling, but all in all\nthey've got no major flaws.\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * Great sound \n\n  * Amazing battery life \n\n  * Easy setup \n\n#### Cons\n\n  * A bit heavy \n\n  * Some BT issues \n\n  * No customization \n\n[ $299.00 from Amazon\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07N3RPPB7%3Ftag%3Dreviewedcom03-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1?gen=unspecified&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n[ $299.00 from B&H\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fknl.mntzrlt.net%2Fshop-\nrest%2Fapi%2Ftrack%2Fv2%2F1049%2F5%2F11159%3Foi%3D4100156007%26xp%3D11%26mk%3DUSD_EN%26tu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%252Fc%252Fproduct%252F1459071-REG%252Faudio_technica_consumer_ath_anc900bt_quietpoint_wireless_active.html?gen=unspecified&retailer=bh&source=skimlinks)\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nqoxfqlJk--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_150/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1519231099908/Apple-AirPods.jpg)\n\nApple AirPods\n\nApple's regular AirPods may be getting a little long in the tooth (even after\nan \"update\" of sorts for the second generation), but there's a reason these\nheadphones helped kickstart the true wireless craze. They have impressive\nrange (for [true wireless earbuds](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/best-\nright-now/the-best-true-wireless-earbuds), anyway), a small and powerful\ncharging case, and they are incredibly easy to pair and use\u2014especially with\niPhones.\n\nSound quality and battery life are both middling and there's also no water\nresistance, though that doesn't seem to hold people back from taking them to\nthe gym. Another drawback is their lack of any ear tips or other ways to\ncustomize the fit\u2014an issue that was handily solved by the AirPods Pro\u2014 though\nagain, that doesn't seem to deter many people.\n\nWhile they may not be the best value in today's market, Apple's regular\nAirPods are a stalwart option, and their mix of handy features and dead-simple\nconvenience make them a go-to choice for many.\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * Outstanding connectivity \n\n  * Easy to set up with other Apple products \n\n  * Compact charging case \n\n#### Cons\n\n  * Middling audio quality \n\n  * Not comfortable to wear for long periods \n\n[ $127.23 from Amazon\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PYLT6DN%3Ftag%3Dreviewedcom03-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1?gen=unspecified&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n[ $134.99 from Best Buy\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F50053%2F633495%2F10014%3Fprodsku%3D6084400%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fapi.bestbuy.com%252Fclick%252F-%252F6084400%252Fpdp%26intsrc%3DAPIG_4831?gen=unspecified&retailer=bestbuy&source=bestbuy)\n[ $139.00 from Walmart\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F50053%2F568844%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26prodsku%3D604342441%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252F604342441?gen=unspecified&retailer=walmart&source=walmart)\n[ $139.99 from Target\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F50053%2F201333%2F2092%3Fprodsku%3D54191097%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.target.com%252Fp%252Fapple-\nairpods-with-wired-charging-\ncase%252F-%252FA-54191097%26intsrc%3DAPIG_1444?gen=unspecified&retailer=target&source=target)\n\n![](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nYXG5Cgts--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_150,q_1,w_150/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1519231645846/Jabra-Elite-65t.jpg)\n\nJabra Elite 65t\n\nThe Jabra Elite 65t true wireless earbuds were new for 2018, and they were\ngenerally excellent in our testing. They offer very good sound quality, a snug\nfit, good battery life, superb wireless range, and even compatibility with\nAmazon Alexa.\n\nThe Jabra Elite 65t are a good all-around alternative to the Apple AirPods for\npeople who don't have an iPhone, though their larger bulb-shaped design is\ndefinitely more awkward in your ear. They're very similar to the Samsung Gear\nIconX in terms of fit and size, but they don't get jammed uncomfortably deep\nin your ear canal.\n\nThe main knocks against the Elite 65t are the same ones we had with pretty\nmuch all other true wireless earbuds: They're a bit big to leave in your ears\nfor an extended period of time, the on-ear controls are workable but cause the\nbuds to shift around, and they're just less convenient than wired or other\nwireless headphones.\n\nThat said, they offer at least some protection against sweat and moisture,\nthey're relatively affordable compared to some other true wireless models, and\nJabra backs them up with a two-year guarantee against damage from dust and\nmoisture. It's not enough for us to recommend them over the AirPods, but for\nAndroid users or those who want something with a bit more water-resistance,\nthey're an awesome backup.\n\n#### Pros\n\n  * Great sound quality \n\n  * Good battery life \n\n  * Outstanding wireless range \n\n#### Cons\n\n  * Not great for smaller ears \n\n[ $48.02 from Amazon\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB077ZGRVRX%3Ftag%3Dreviewedcom03-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1?gen=unspecified&retailer=amazon&source=amazon)\n[ $119.99 from Best Buy\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F50053%2F633495%2F10014%3Fprodsku%3D6181245%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fapi.bestbuy.com%252Fclick%252F-%252F6181245%252Fpdp%26intsrc%3DAPIG_4831?gen=unspecified&retailer=bestbuy&source=bestbuy)\n[ $119.99 from Walmart\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F50053%2F568844%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26prodsku%3D495887821%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252F495887821?gen=unspecified&retailer=walmart&source=walmart)\n[ $119.99 from Verizon\n](https://www.reviewed.com/affiliates/https%3A%2F%2Fknl.mntzrlt.net%2Fshop-\nrest%2Fapi%2Ftrack%2Fv2%2F1049%2F5%2F10082%3Foi%3D5669232758%26xp%3D11%26mk%3DUSD_EN%26tu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.verizon.com%252Fproducts%252Fjabra-\nelite-65t%252F?gen=unspecified&retailer=verizon&source=skimlinks)\n\n## More Articles You Might Enjoy\n\n  * [The Best Wireless Earbuds](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/best-right-now/best-wireless-earbuds)\n  * [The Best Wireless Earbuds for Running](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/best-right-now/best-wireless-headphones-for-running-or-the-gym)\n  * [The Best On-Ear and Over-Ear Wireless Headphones](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/best-right-now/the-best-on-ear-and-over-ear-wireless-headphones)\n  * [The Best True Wireless Earbuds](https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/best-right-now/the-best-true-wireless-earbuds)\n\n##  Meet the testers\n\n![Lee Neikirk](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--\nb16vgshG--/b_white,c_fit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_160,q_1,w_160/https://reviewed-\nproduction.s3.amazonaws.com/1546272757253/headshot-1-1-crop.jpg)\n\nLee Neikirk\n\nEditor\n\n[ @Koanshark ](https://twitter.com/Koanshark)\n\nLee has been Reviewed's point person for most television and home theater\nproducts since 2012.
