The wireless\nrevolution means ever-more advanced Bluetooth codecs, longer-lasting batteries\nand better-sounding performance \u2013 greats news for those of us who value\nquality sound and convenience.\n\nWhile a few years ago we would have still recommended [wired\nheadphones](https://www.whathifi.com/us/best-buys/headphones/best-headphones)\nfor those who prioritise sound quality (and for the utmost sound-per-pound, we\nstill would), the best wireless headphones these days really do make ideal\ncompanions for listening to music on the move. Such as the ones you'll see\nbelow.\n\nWith quality has come quantity, though \u2013 the market is awash with wireless\npairs \u2013 so before you start hunting you should decide what type of headphones\nyou want. Our round-up of the best wireless headphones includes over-ear\nwireless headphones, often with noise-cancelling thrown in for good measure,\nwith brands such as Sony, Bose, Sennheiser, B&W and AKG leading the way.\n\nAnd there are also now plenty of in-ear wireless earphones \u2013 some with\nneckband cables joining the buds, but others, known as 'true wireless', where\nthe earpieces are completely untethered from one another. Yes, like AirPods.\n\nWhatever wireless style you require, we've got the best wireless headphones\nyou can buy, all tried and tested by the _What Hi-Fi?_ reviews team.\n\n![Best wireless headphones\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 1\\. Sony WH-1000XM3\n\nJack of all trades and master of all; the Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones are a\nsuperb all-round package\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Bluetooth:** Yes | **Noise-cancelling:** Yes | **Battery life:** 30hr |\n**Charging:** USB-C | **Built-in mic and controls:** Yes\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nDetailed dynamic sound\n\nClever, intuitive features\n\nGreat noise-cancelling, battery life\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nTouch controls feel fiddly at first\n\n2019 (and 2018) What Hi-Fi? Award winners, the WH-1000XM3s are Sony's latest\nwireless noise-cancelling [headphones](https://www.whathifi.com/us/best-\nbuys/headphones/best-headphones) and one of the most comfortable pairs of on-\nears we\u2019ve tested with thick, cushioned earpads that completely envelop your\nears. Features include Sony's Atmospheric Pressure Optimiser which optimises\nthe noise-cancelling for when you're flying, touchpad controls and an\naccompanying Headphones Control app. Thanks to a quick charging battery (done\nvia USB-C), the WH-1000XM3s go from empty to full in three hours while a ten\nminute charge gives you a whopping five hours of use.\n\nThey produce an open, spacious sound that gives every instrument, effect and\nvocal room to breathe. Vocals sound focused and direct, but the instruments\naround them are delivered in a way that makes it feel as if you\u2019re in the room\nwith the band. Combine that spaciousness with greater detail, dynamic subtlety\nand loads of lovely deep bass and you've got a breathtaking noise-cancelling\npackage. If you can stretch to these excellent Bluetooth cans you won't be\ndisappointed.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Sony\nWH-1000XM3**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/sony/wh-1000xm3/review)\n\n[ **Best Sony headphones 2020**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/best-buys/best-\nsony-headphones-budget-premium-bluetooth-noise-cancelling)\n\n![Best wireless headphones\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Cambridge Audio)\n\n### 2\\. Cambridge Audio Melomania 1\n\nA truly exceptional pair of true wireless in-ear headphones.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Bluetooth:** Yes | **Noise-cancelling:** No | **Battery life:** 9hr |\n**Charging:** Micro USB | **In-line mic and controls:** Yes\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nDetailed, insightful sound\n\nReliable Bluetooth\n\nLong battery life\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nSome may find the fit difficult\n\nIf you're searching for sonic purity, these buds are hard to beat for the\nmoney. Another 2019 What Hi-Fi? Award winner, these budget-conscious in-ears\noffer a cohesive, expansive and rhythmically driven sound, but also an\nintuitive, playful soundstage that few wireless in-ears can achieve at the\nprice.\n\nWhen it comes to in-ears, a good fit is essential. Due to the length of the\nearpiece itself, that might not be as easy to come by for everybody but, given\ntheir exceptional sonic talent, it's worth the effort and potential purchase\nof extra buds.\n\nWith nine hours battery life from the buds themselves, plus four additional\ncharges from the case, that means a marathon 45 hours of continuous use from\nthis little set-up. There's no active noise cancelling, but it's abundantly\nclear that Cambridge Audio has focussed on great sound over bonus features.\nThe result? Sonically-superior buds that fall within most budgets. A superb\nbuy.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Cambridge Audio Melomania\n1**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/cambridge-audio-melomania-1)\n\n![Best wireless headphones\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Sony)\n\n### 3\\. Sony WF-1000XM3\n\nA new benchmark for true wireless headphones.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Bluetooth:** Yes | **Noise-cancelling:** Yes | **Battery life:** 6hrs (24hrs\nwith charging case) | **Charging:** USB-C | **Built-in mic and controls:** Yes\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nGreat musicality\n\nExcellent noise-cancelling\n\nDecent battery life\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nLack volume controls\n\nDon't support aptX HD\n\nNot only do these 2019 What Hi-Fi? Award winners come pack brilliant noise-\ncancelling tech into their tiny frames, they come with more sizes of tip than\nmost rivals, so you should be able to achieve the perfect fit. The touch\ncontrols are intuitive (even if volume controls are conspicuous by their\nabsence) and they sound wonderfully musical: instruments sound natural,\nbelievable and wholly expressive. There's plenty of subtlety on show too, and\na great level of detail.\n\nSony upped its game when it comes to noise-cancelling tech, too. At the heart\nof each earpiece lies a Sony QN1e HD noise-cancelling processor, which is both\nhighly effective and easy on the battery. You get six hours of playback as\nstandard, while the case has enough power for an extra three charges, giving a\ntotal of 24 hours when using Bluetooth and noise-cancelling together.\n\nIf you prefer earbuds to over-ear headphones, these are the cream of the\ncurrent crop and well worth splashing out on.\n\n**Read the full review:**[ **Sony\nWF-1000XM3**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/sony-wf-1000xm3)\n\n![Best wireless headphones\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n###  4\\. AKG N60NC Wireless\n\nAttractive portable noise-cancellers with a punchy, balanced sound.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Bluetooth:** Yes | **Noise-cancelling:** Yes | **Battery life:** 30hr |\n**Charging:** Micro USB | **Built-in mic and controls:** Yes\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nClear, punchy sound\n\nMusical; balanced\n\nSmart design\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nNothing of note\n\nOne of the most compact and convenient pairs of noise-cancelling headphones\nwe've ever tested, the AKG N60NCs deliver a superb performance for the money.\nThey're a good-looking pair of on-ears with an excellent fit. Battery life is\n15 hours with the noise-cancelling and Bluetooth engaged and this ramps up to\n30 hours when the noise-cancelling is turned off.\n\nBass delivery is powerful yet transparent with crisp vocals, soaring highs and\nconvincing dynamics that sound impressively spacious sound given the compact,\non-the-go design. Sturdy metal (rather than plastic) housings between the ear\ncups and headband mean these cans should travel well.\n\nThe active noise-cancelling automatically kicks in when using these headphones\nwirelessly, but you'll find a 3.5mm cable in the box for wired use. They're\nnot quite as comfy as the pricier [Sony\nWH-1000XM3s](https://www.whathifi.com/us/sony/wh-1000xm3/review), but we'd\nstill be content to wear them all day. For the money, they're extremely tough\nto beat.\n\n**Read the full review:**[ **AKG N60NC\nWireless**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/akg/n60nc-wireless/review)\n\n![Best wireless headphones\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Bowers & Wilkins)\n\n### 5\\. Bowers & Wilkins PX7\n\nHugely impressive noise-cancelling headphones\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Bluetooth:** Yes | **Noise-cancelling:** Yes | **Battery life:** 30hr |\n**Charging:** USB-C | **Built-in mic and controls:** Yes\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nLively, insightful sound\n\nThree-tiered noise cancellation\n\nSophisticated, comfortable design\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nEarcups don\u2019t fold inwards\n\nB&W\u2019s flagship noise-cancellers are born entertainers, capable of rubbing\nshoulders with the very best in their class. When you think about it, all a\npair of headphones can do is sound, look and feel great \u2013 and the B&W PX7s\ntick all three of those boxes with a flourish.\n\nPressing a button on the headphones\u2019 left cup allows you to cycle through\nnoise-cancelling modes (low, medium and high), so you should be able to\nretreat into quiet solitude anytime, anywhere. The striking design is matched\nby exhilarating sound, which is detailed, tonally balanced and blessed with a\nlarge dose of rhythmic precision. As as is common with premium headphones, the\nPX7s have a proximity sensor: when you lift them off of your head, the track\nis automatically paused. Put them on, and the track restarts.\n\nThe Sonys at the top this list might have pipped these over-ears to a 2019\nWhat Hi-Fi? Awards Best Buy, but the PX7s are fine alternatives \u2013 especially\nfor those who value sonic sprightliness and good design.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Bowers & Wilkins PX7\nreview**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/bowers-and-wilkins-px7-review)\n\n![Best wireless headphones\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Dixons)\n\n### 6\\. Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless\n\nSuperb noise-cancellers that enhance Sennheiser\u2019s reputation\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Bluetooth:** Yes | **Noise-cancelling:** Yes | **Battery life:** 17hr |\n**Charging:** USB-C | **Built-in mic and controls:** Yes\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nEnergetic, rhythmic presentation\n\nConvenient usability features\n\nEffective noise cancellation\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nUncompetitive battery life\n\nSennheiser doesn\u2019t need any \u2018third time lucky\u2019 well wishes for its third-\ngeneration Momentum Wirelesses \u2013 both the originals and second versions were\ninstant knockouts when they arrived. The Momentum 3s have been much improved\nover their predecessors in the sound department, delivering an energetic,\ntimely and hugely insightful listen you've no choice but to be entertained by.\n\nThat sonic success is backed by enhanced usability features too. Through the\nSennheiser control app, you can adjust EQ settings, view battery life and\nswitch between three noise-cancelling modes: 'Max\u2019, \u2018Anti-Wind\u2019 (which allows\nsome surrounding noise in) and \u2018Anti-Pressure\u2019, the least intensive. A button\non the right ear cup activates your chosen voice assistant on the connected\nphone, whether that\u2019s Google Assistant or Siri.\n\nIt's worth noting that the battery life is only 17 hours next to the above\nSony's 30-hour claim, but in every other respect these premium noise-\ncancellers are a class act.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Sennheiser Momentum 3\nWireless**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/sennheiser-momentum-wireless)\n\n[ **Best Sennheiser headphones 2020**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/best-\nbuys/best-sennheiser-headphones-brilliant-pairs-for-every-budget)\n\n![Best wireless headphones\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: JBL)\n\n### 7\\.

Three sets of tips and fins are supplied in the box, so\nyou should be be able to achieve a secure and sports-worthy fit (when we\ntested them, they didn't budge).\n\nFeatures include ambient mode, which lets in some external sound, and\n'TalkThru', which lowers the volume and allows for conversation without\nremoving the buds. Battery life is ten hours from the buds themselves, plus 20\nmore via the chunky case, and the whole lot can go from empty to fully charged\nin about two hours.\n\n[Cambridge Audio's Melomania 1](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/cambridge-\naudio-melomania-1) buds (above) offer more detail and sonic sparkle \u2013 but\nthose buds are not intended for sport use. Within their niche, the JBL Reflect\nFlow headphones are very good indeed, especially if you want a bass-heavy\nsound for the gym without resorting to cans.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **J** _ **BL Reflect\nFlow**_](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/jbl-reflect-flow)\n\n![Best wireless headphones\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n###  8\\. AKG Y50BT\n\nThe Y50BTs sound almost as good as their wired counterparts, excelling in the\n'clarity' and 'insight' departments.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Bluetooth:** Yes | **Noise-cancelling:** No | **Battery life:** 20hr |\n**Charging:** Micro USB | **Built-in mic and controls:** Yes\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nImpressive clarity, detail and dynamics\n\nEasy to use\n\nComfortable\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nNothing at this price\n\nThe AKG Y50BTs have been around for a few years now, but their ability for the\nmoney is unquestionable. The sound is excellent by wireless standards. It\u2019s\nremarkably clear, offering the sort of insight that makes it easy to tell the\ncalibre of the talent on hand. Bags of detail go hand-in-hand with that\nclarity. You get all manner of texture to instruments and vocals, which are\norganised well enough for you to appreciate the sense of space and separation.\n\nThe right ear cup has buttons for volume, play/pause, and power/pairing.\nPairing is easy \u2013 Bluetooth connection takes no time at all, and we don\u2019t\nexperience any dropouts. And they\u2019re practical too. They\u2019re comfortable to\nwear, even with glasses, and they don\u2019t get warm too quickly. And when you\u2019re\ndone listening, the earcups swivel flat and fold inwards, small enough to fit\nin a coat pocket. If you\u2019re looking for an affordable pair of Bluetooth on-ear\nheadphones, look no further.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **AKG\nY50BT**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/akg/y50bt/review)\n\n![Best wireless headphones\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Bowers & Wilkins)\n\n### 9\\. Bowers & Wilkins PI3\n\nBrilliant wireless neckband buds from B&W\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Bluetooth:** Yes | **Noise-cancelling:** No | **Battery life:** 8hr |\n**Charging:** Micro USB | **Built-in mic and controls:** Yes\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nClean, detailed presentation\n\nSolid, weighty and tight bass\n\nFlexible design and fine build\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nNot IPX rated\n\nLack of eartip options\n\nIn the market for a pair of talented wireless earbuds and don\u2019t mind a\nneckband design? You should definitely consider these new Bowers & Wilkins\nPI3s. [Bluetooth aptX Adaptive](https://www.whathifi.com/us/news/qualcomms-\naptx-adaptive-bluetooth-24-bit-support-low-latency-and-glitch-free-streaming)\nis supported, which should ensure higher quality audio from smartphones and\ntablets, and removes the potential for any lip-sync issues when it comes to\nwatching video content. And their eight-hour battery life is good for this\nclass (a 15-minute quick charge gets you two hours of playtime, too).\n\nDesign and finish are superb (as reflected in the price tag). If the earpieces\nare a little chunky, that's because they house B&W's Dual Driver technology,\nwith one driver is used for highs and mids, and another for bass. The result\nis a clean-sounding presentation with a combination of crisp, distinct highs\nand a solid, punchy bass bringing up the rear. Indeed, these are confident and\ncomposed performers that serve to expand B&W\u2019s headphone offering for the\nbetter.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Bowers & Wilkins\nPI3**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/bowers-and-wilkins-pi3)\n\n![Best wireless headphones\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n### 10\\.

They're sweat resistant and certified to IPX4, meaning they can\u2019t be\nsubmerged but will handle sweat and splashes better than normal earphones. The\nin-line remote barely weighs anything, while the soft silicone rubber hooks\nmake for a fit secure enough for running or going to the gym.\n\nBattery life is a modest six hours, but that should be more than enough for\nthe average workout, daily commute or leisurely jog.

If the buds die, there's the\noption to fast-charge in the case: five minutes returns an hour of listening.\nThey might not sound quite as dynamic and rich as the [Sony\nWF-1000XM3](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/sony-wf-1000xm3)s but, for\nmany, they could be the only pair of headphones they ever need.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Apple AirPods\nPro**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/apple-airpods-pro)\n\n[ **Apple AirPods 2 vs AirPods Pro: which is\nbetter?**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/advice/apple-airpods-2-vs-airpods-pro-\nwhich-are-better)\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Shure)\n\n### 13\\. Shure Aonic 50\n\nA solid debut pair of wireless noise-cancelling headphones from Shure.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Bluetooth:** Yes | **Noise-cancelling:** Yes | **Battery life:** 20hr |\n**In-line mic and controls:** Yes | **Charging:** USB-C\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nOutstanding levels of detail\n\nClear and clean delivery\n\nSolid bass\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nNoise-cancelling is a mixed bag\n\nNot as engaging as class-leaders\n\nAudio specialist Shure has designed some of the best wired in-ear and over-ear\nheadphones we\u2019ve heard over the years and its products are used by artists\nranging from Haim to Hozier. But why stop there?\n\nWith the Aonic 50s, Shure is embarking on an ambitious journey to break into\ntwo new markets at once. Given this is new ground for Shure, the Aonic 50s are\na solid first attempt at a pair of wireless noise-canceling headphones. They\naren't the last word in engagement (they don't leave the same lasting\nimpression as the [Sony\nWH-1000XM3s](https://www.whathifi.com/us/sony/wh-1000xm3/review) or [B&W\nPX7s](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/bowers-and-wilkins-px7-review)\nabove, for example), but they\u2019re strong performers in a lot of areas.\n\nLooking for a premium pair of noise-cancelling headphones with some of Shure\u2019s\nfamous audio pedigree, the Aonic 50s are worth a listen.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Shure Aonic\n50**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/shure-aonic-50)\n\n![Best wireless headphones\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n### 14\\. Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 On-Ear Wireless\n\nThese premium wireless noise-cancellers look stylish, offer great\nfunctionality and sound superb.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Bluetooth:** Yes | **Noise-cancelling:** Yes | **Battery life:** 22hr |\n**In-line mic and controls:** Yes | **Charging:** Micro USB\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nClear, detailed midrange\n\nRich bass\n\nGood noise cancellation\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nNothing of note\n\nNow that the third-generation Sennheiser Momentum Wirelesses have arrived\n(currently occupying the number two spot on this list), their predecessors,\nwhich launched back in 2015 and won a What Hi-Fi? Award, can be picked up at a\ntempting discount.\n\nFrom a design perspective, the Momentum 2.0 Wireless are as desirable as ever,\nwith thick leather ear cups and and an all-leather headband. They're also\ncollapsible for added portability. Headline features include aptX Bluetooth\nand active noise cancellation, both of which produce excellent results. Sound\nis rich and full-bodied, displaying plenty of that signature Momentum verve.\n\nYou get around 22 hours of wireless music playback with noise cancellation\nactivated, and should you drain that you can attach the included cable and\ncontinue listening passively (passive mode is available when wired only). Now\nthat these cans are heavily discounted, these premium noise-cancellers are an\nabsolute bargain.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Sennheiser Momentum 2.0\nWireless**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/sennheiser/momentum-20-wireless/review)\n\n![](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Sennheiser)\n\n### 15\\.

Philips PH805\n\nSeemingly premium on-ear noise-cancellers for a less than premium price.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Bluetooth:** Yes | **Noise-cancelling:** Yes | **Battery life:** 30hr |\n**Charging:** Micro USB | **Built-in mic and controls:** Yes\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nControlled, full-bodied sound\n\nDecent battery life\n\nGood looks and build\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nCould handle more dynamism\n\nMild noise-cancellation\n\nPhilips\u2019s strategy is to pack in most of the functionality of the current\nmarket-leaders, wrap it in a design not a million miles away from that of the\ncurrent market-leaders, and then charge a fair bit less than the current\nmarket-leaders. And it's mostly nailed that strategy here, offering a\ncontrolled, full-bodied performance and competitive battery life.\n\nAside from the slightly inhibited high-end reproduction, the PH805s are a\nreally even-handed listen all the way down to the bottom of the frequency\nrange. Certainly, no area gets undue emphasis, and integration is nice and\nsmooth too.\n\nHowever, if one of your major considerations when selecting your next pair of\nheadphones is their noise-cancelling efficiency, the PH805s may not be for\nyou. They just don\u2019t negate as much external noise as their rivals.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Philips\nPH805**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/philips-ph805)\n\n![Best wireless headphones\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n###  17\\. Lindy BNX-60\n\nGreat-value Bluetooth on-ears that sound splendid for the money.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Bluetooth:** Yes | **Noise-cancelling:** Yes | **Battery life:** 15hr |\n**Charging:** Micro USB | **Built-in mic and controls:** Yes\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nGreat value\n\nDetailed, solid sound\n\nNoise-cancelling and Bluetooth\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nTreble a little muffled in standard mode\n\nThe budget BNX-60s show that noise-cancelling and aptX Bluetooth can both\ncarried off in a package well under what you'd expect for these features. And\nwhat they lack in frills, they make up for in comfort and pound-for-pound\nperformance.\n\nFunctionality is simple. One ear cup has a volume control, the on/off switch\nfor the active noise-cancellation and a blue light that indicates when noise-\ncancelling is in use. The other cup has the USB input for charging,\npause/play/skip track controls, a Bluetooth connection light and a standard\nwired headphone output. A full charge is good for 15 hours of wireless music,\nor a little less with the active noise-cancelling.\n\nAt this price, you'd be worried about bright treble or booming bass, but\ninstead, the Lindy BNX-60s produce a balanced sound that\u2019s easy to listen to.\nThe noise-cancelling does the solid job but isn't as capable as the (more\nexpensive) Sony, Bose and Sennheiser models in this list. But for this kind of\nmoney, it's extremely hard to grumble.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Lindy\nBNX-60**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/lindy/bnx-60/review)\n\n![Best wireless headphones\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Bose)\n\n### 18\\. Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700\n\nNot perfect, but impressive noise-cancelling and design is best in class.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Bluetooth:** Yes | **Noise-cancelling:** Yes | **Battery life:** 20hr |\n**In-line mic and controls:** Yes | **Charging:** USB-C\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nNext-gen noise-cancellation\n\nComfortable and stylish\n\nCrystal-clear, upfront sound\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nLack class-leading insight\n\nExpensive\n\nBose says these Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 on-ears are \u2018the biggest leap\nforward in headphones since the iconic QuietComfort\u2019 \u2013 a bold claim\nconsidering the success of that range.\n\nThey're certainly innovative, with a noise-cancelling system as sophisticated\nas we've seen. It features eight microphones and 11 increments (from 0-10) of\nnoise-cancellation intensity, allowing you to transition from full isolation\nto full transparency. The only downside to all that advanced tech is its\nimpact on battery life, which is about 20 hours here \u2013 ten hours less than the\n[Sony WH-1000XMX3](https://www.whathifi.com/us/sony/wh-1000xm3/review)s.\n\nThe sleek, minimalist cans gets a thumbs up for aesthetics and comfort \u2013 their\nsecure grip just the right balance between loose and vice-like. There's also\ntouch controls, meaning you can adjust the volume or skip a track with the\nswipe of a finger. They need a bit more transparency to trouble the class\nleaders in this category, but it's hard not to get along with their crystal-\nclear, upfront and punchy sound.\n\n **Read the full review:**[ **Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones\n700**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/bose-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones-700-review)\n\n![Best wireless headphones\n2020](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whathifi/media/img/missing-image.svg)\n\n(Image credit: Eric Jones at Jones Studio Ltd)\n\n### 19\\. Grado GW100\n\nGrado's first wireless 'phones are truly excellent, but won't be for everyone.\n\n **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n**Bluetooth:** Yes | **Noise-cancelling:** No | **Battery life:** 15hr | **In-\nline mic and controls:** No | **Charging:** microUSB | **Design:** Open-back\n\n#### Reasons to Buy\n\nClean, transparent, lively sound\n\nSolid, compact build\n\nFoolproof operation\n\n#### Reasons to Avoid\n\nA touch bright-sounding\n\nNo in-line remote\n\nPoor battery life\n\nGrado's GW100 headphones are something of a contradiction. They\u2019re wireless,\nmeaning their purpose is granting untethered portability so you can listen to\nmusic out and about, free of wires. But their open-back design leaks sound\nboth in and out, making them less than ideal in noisy environments, and pretty\nunsociable in crowded train carriages.\n\nStill, it's their openness that gifts the GW100s a wonderful sonic ability.\nMidrange is fast, clean and lively and, compared with many closed-back\nheadphones, superbly spacious. Their solid, retro design features basic\nfunctionality. We found the power and volume buttons, as well as the instant\nBluetooth pairing, more than satisfactory. You can use them for wired\nlistening, but the supplied cable doesn't have an in-line remote.\n\nWhile the GW100s won\u2019t be for everyone, they are perfect for home\nenvironments, pottering around the garden or listening to a Bluetooth\nturntable when isolation isn't important. A bit niche, perhaps, but they do\ndeliver up excellent sound for the money.\n\n**Read the full review:** [**Grado\nGW100**](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/grado-gw100)\n\n  * [ _ **Best headphone deals**_](https://www.whathifi.com/us/deals/the-best-cyber-monday-headphones-deals-2019)\n  * [ _ **Best headphones 2020**_](https://www.whathifi.com/us/best-buys/headphones/best-headphones)\n\n__ See all comments (1)\n\n1 Comment [ Comment from the forums\n](https://forums.whathifi.com/threads/best-wireless-headphones-2020-the-best-\nbluetooth-headphones-you-can-buy.111284/)\n\n  * Bhav 01 January 2020 15:00\n\nI find it strange you haven't reviewed the Audio-Technica ATH-DSR9BT or ATH-\nDSR7BT, which on many forums are considered the best sounding Bluetooth\nheadphones with their direct digital drive technology.
