When Apple first announced the iPhone 7, which\ndropped the headphone jack in favor of a wireless connection, many were more\nthan a little frustrated. Traditionally speaking, wired headphones have been\nof a higher quality, both sound-wise and when it comes to reliability. Now,\nhowever, that's changing, and the gap in sound quality is closing.\n\nIf you've decided you want to ditch those annoying wires in favor of wireless\nheadphones, there are a number of things to consider. The first thing you'll\nneed to decide is what form-factor you prefer. Do you want over-ear\nheadphones, on-ear headphones, or in-ear headphones? Over-ear headphones\ngenerally sound better and are more comfortable, while in-ears are far more\nportable, and on-ear headphones attempt to strike a balance between those two.\n\nYou'll also want to consider whether you want noise-cancellation, which helps\ncut out the background noise while you're listening. Last but not least,\nyou'll want to think about your budget.

In\nour testing, the best wireless headphones money can buy are the [Sennheiser\nMomentum 2.0 Wireless over-ear headphones](https://amzn.to/2Cg3atK).\n\nThere are a number of things that make these headphones so good. For starters,\nthey look beautiful. The headphones are built with premium leather, along with\na strong metal frame and a rustic look. It's a great combination, but the\nbuild doesn't just make them good-looking \u2014 it also makes them nice and\nstrong.\n\nWhile the headphones do have an over-ear design, they are somewhat portable.\nThey fold up and fit into a nice strong case, which is included in your\npurchase. The case is great for those of you who want to take your cans on the\ngo. The Sennheiser headphones are comfortable, too. They have nice memory foam\nin the ear-cups, and while we would have liked to see a little more foam in\nthe headband, that's not a deal-breaker by any means.\n\nThen there's the sound, which is the highlight of these headphones. The\nSennheiser Wireless over-ear headphones boast a deep, rich low-end, along with\na well-tuned and accurate mid-range and crisp high-end. They also have noise\ncancellation, and while it's a little annoying that you can't deactivate it if\nyou want, it well help keep that extra noise out so you can listen to your\nmusic in peace.\n\nWe're not the only ones who love the [Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless\nheadphones](https://amzn.to/2Cg3atK). They scored [9/10 in a review from\nHeadphone Review](https://headphonereview.com/over-ear/sennheiser-\nhd-1-wireless-over-ear-review), and their predecessor, the Momentum Wireless\n2.0 headphones [scored 9/10 on Trusted\nReview](http://www.trustedreviews.com/sennheiser-momentum-2-0-review) and [4/5\non CNET](https://www.cnet.com/products/sennheiser-momentum-2-0/). The main\ndownside to these headphones is that they're not cheap. To get them, you'll\nneed to shell out a cool $350 to $500, but if you do, you won't be sorry. \u2014\n_Christian de Looper_\n\n **Pros:** Beautiful design, relatively comfortable, excellent sound quality\n\n **Cons:** Expensive, could use more padding in headband\n\n### [Buy the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless over-ear headphones on Amazon\nfor $249](https://amzn.to/2Cg3atK)\n\n## The best noise-canceling wireless headphones\n\n[ ![bose headphones](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg\nxmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5bfef869c9570138fe5a7f90?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\nAmazon  ](https://amzn.to/2QYe7Ze)\n\n### The noise cancellation technology on the [Bose QuietComfort 35\nheadphones](https://amzn.to/2QYe7Ze) is the best around, but the headphones\nalso sound great and are extremely comfortable.\n\nBose is a powerhouse in the headphone world and has been especially successful\nwhen it comes to noise cancelling headphones. In our testing, the headphones\nwith the best noise cancellation technology are the [Bose QuietComfort 35\nheadphones](https://amzn.to/2QYe7Ze). When these cans are on, the noise\ncancellation is almost eerie.\n\nThe headphones aren't just great for noise cancellation. They're extremely\ncomfortable and sound great, too. Sure, the design isn't all that interesting,\nbut for many people that doesn't matter as much as the noise cancellation\ntechnology and sound quality. If you're into customizing your cans to suit\nyour personality, you can [design your own headphone on Bose's\nwebsite](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-\ncustom/buy.html#src=prodRef&v=qc35_custom_color&csd=1%7Cqc35_custom_color%7C10%3Bdo%3Bstg%3BGL%7C9%3Bec%3Bstg%3BGL%7C8%3Bop%3Bstg%3BGL%7C7%3Bip%3Bstg%3BGL%7C6%3Boh%3Bstg%3BGL%7C5%3Bih%3Bstg%3BGL%7C4%3Bsp%3Bstg%3BGL%7C3%3Bob%3Bstg%3BGL%7C2%3Bib%3Bstg%3BGL%7C).\n\nThe [Bose QuietComfort 35 headphones](https://amzn.to/2QYe7Ze) also come with\neverything you'll need to take them on planes and around town, including a\nnice carry case, plane adapter, and an aux cable for when you want to use them\nin wired mode. Speaking of which, wired mode is, unfortunately, the only time\nyou can use these headphones _without_ noise cancellation on. There's no\nswitch to turn it off when they're connected through Bluetooth.\n\nPlenty of reviewers loved the headphones besides us. [Trusted Reviews gave\nthem 9/10](http://www.trustedreviews.com/bose-quietcomfort-35-review), [CNET\ngave them 4.5/5](https://www.cnet.com/products/bose-quietcomfort-35/), and\n[Headphone Review gave them 9/10](https://headphonereview.com/over-ear/bose-\nquietcomfort-35-review/). They are a little pricey, coming in at $299 to $350,\nbut paying that will get you the best noise canceling headphones around. \u2014\n_Christian de Looper_\n\n **Pros:** Excellent noise cancellation, great sound quality, very comfortable\n\n **Cons:** Expensive, slightly boring design\n\n### [Buy the Bose QuietComfort 35 headphones on Amazon for\n$349](https://amzn.to/2QYe7Ze)\n\n## The best on-ear wireless headphones\n\n[ ![AKG headphones](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg\nxmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5931c86579474cbd1b8b6301?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\nAKG  ](http://amzn.to/2rXdxPd)\n\n### The [AKG N60 NC Wireless headphones](http://amzn.to/2rXdxPd) have an\nexcellent design, feel comfortable, and sound great, but they're also super\nportable and live safely in an included carry pouch.\n\nLooking for something a little more portable than the over-ear Sennheiser\nWireless headphones? The [AKG N60 NC Wireless\nheadphones](http://amzn.to/2rXdxPd) could be the ones for you.\n\nThe headphones feature a super sleek design with a black and silver color\nscheme, along with an on-ear form factor, which makes them a lot more portable\nthan over-ear headphones. They're made even more portable with their swiveling\nearcups, which help the headphones fit nice and snugly in the included carry\nbag.\n\nThe [AKG N60 NC headphones](http://amzn.to/2rXdxPd) are comfortable, too.\nThere's a good amount of memory foam in both the earcups and the headband. The\nbest thing about these headphones, however, is that they sound great. There's\na ton of low-end frequencies, though the bass doesn't go overboard. The high\nfrequencies are nice and clear, too, which helps the music sound crisp.\n\nNext up is the fact that these headphones also feature noise cancellation\nthat's better than you'll find on many other headphones. It's not quite as\ngood as the Bose QuietComfort 35's tech, but it's good nonetheless. The\nheadphones aren't perfect. In the pair we tested, there was a small amount of\nBluetooth noise, which came in the form of a very faint buzzing in the\nbackground. You couldn't hear it while music was playing, but it was a little\nannoying.\n\nOthers liked the [N60 NC Wireless headphones](http://amzn.to/2rXdxPd), too.\nThey scored [8.7/10 on Headphone Review](https://headphonereview.com/on-\near/akg-n60-nc-wireless-review/).

They're on the better end of the spectrum with battery life,\ntoo. A single charge will get you 20 hours of listening time.\n\nThe headphones have reviews like the [4/5 rating on\nPCMag](http://www.pcmag.com/review/352434/jbl-e55bt) and [8.1/10 on Headphone\nReview](https://headphonereview.com/over-ear/jbl-e55bt-review/).

Thankfully, [Master &\nDynamic](http://amzn.to/2wLzlvk) delivered with the MW50. From the first time\nyou put them on, you'll appreciate their feel and things will only improve\nwhen you actually start listening to music.\n\nBecause music has to get compressed when sent wirelessly from your phone to\nyour Bluetooth headphones, you end up losing the little details that make\nsongs special. No Bluetooth headphones (at least not right now) will give you\n_every_ nuance you'll hear with a high-end pair of wired ones, but the MW50's\nperformance is excellent.\n\nI was able to pick up on sonic subtleties that would get lost or sound muddy\non lesser pairs, and that was true regardless of what I was listening to.\nMusic encoded at a lower bitrate would sound worse, but that was more a matter\nof the MW50's exposing flaws in the files rather than making them sound that\nway.\n\nThere is a [new version of this pair or headphones](https://amzn.to/2S1ufXb),\nwhich has newer Bluetooth connectivity standards, but you'll pay a bit more\nfor them at $399 as opposed to $295.99. \u2014 _Brandt Ranj_\n\n **Pros:** Excellent sound reproduction, nice feel, great design\n\n **Cons:** Very costly\n\n### [Buy the Master & Dynamic MW50 on Amazon for $349 (originally\n$449)](http://amzn.to/2wLzlvk) \u2014 [Get the new version for\n$399](https://amzn.to/2S1ufXb)\n\n## The best wireless headphones for less than $50\n\n[ ![iFrogz](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/59c5184b25acc28d008b49c2?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\nAmazon  ](http://amzn.to/2ydBDVS)\n\n### If you're just getting into Bluetooth headphones, [iFrogz's Impulse\nDuo](http://amzn.to/2ydBDVS) is a good place to start.\n\nThese iFrogz headphones made the [best earbuds\nguide,](http://www.businessinsider.com/best-earbuds/#the-best-earbuds-\noverall-1) so I'm just going to echo what I said there below:\n\nBesides sounding pretty good for the price, the reason [iFrogz Impulse Duo\nearbuds](http://amzn.to/2ydBDVS) made the cut over all the other budget models\nI've tried is their design.\n\nThe dual driver construction is what gives these earbuds an audio-edge over\nthe competition. But mostly, these earbuds succeed where most Bluetooth models\nfail: Instead of having all of their technology built into an unwieldy dongle\nthat hangs off the cable connecting both buds, iFrogz built it all into a\nmagnetic clip.\n\nClip the dongle onto your clothes, pop in the earbuds, and you're ready to\nlisten to music. In terms of audio quality, you shouldn't expect a truly\naudiophile experience for less than $50, but don't expect a bad one, either.\nThese are actually the upgraded version of the earbuds iFrogz released last\nyear, and while the design is the same, time was spent in improving the sound\nquality.\n\nI'll put it to you this way. These headphones are so easy to use and sound\ngood enough, that they're my go-to pair between reviews. It's just so\nconvenient to coil them up and pop them in my pocket after a commute, or once\nmy friends finally make it to our meeting place. \u2014 _Brandt Ranj_\n\n **Pros: **Excellent design, good sound, affordable, Bluetooth connection\n\n **Cons:** The sound quality isn't as good as other options on this list\n\n### [Buy the iFrogz Impulse Duo on Amazon for $27](http://amzn.to/2xX2j0h)\n\n## The best wireless headphones for travelers\n\n[ ![sony](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5c17da2fad95714fbb718788?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\nSony  ](https://amzn.to/2Lp00GY)\n\n### Noise cancellation is a big deal for daily commuters and avid\ninternational travelers alike \u2014 If you want to block out the world, you'll\nwant [Sony's WH1000XM3 headphones](https://amzn.to/2Lp00GY).\n\nNoise canceling is becoming a common feature for many Bluetooth headphones,\nand for good reason. It's nice to block out the rest of the world during your\nmorning commute or to block out the screaming kid in front of you on the\nplane.\n\n[Sony's headphones](https://amzn.to/2Lp00GY) have the best noise cancellation\nof any headphones \u2014 Bluetooth or otherwise \u2014 that I've ever tested. On a plane\nride from New York to San Francisco, the only thing I heard was the music I\nput on. Without any music, the noise canceling feature was able to block out a\nlot of ambient noise, which should also appeal to you if you're looking to\nsleep en route to your destination.\n\nThis pair of headphones also has a few \"smart\" features, thanks to touch\ncontrols on the right ear cup. Placing your hand on the ear cup activates the\nmicrophone, letting you hear noise (like a pilot's announcement) while\nlowering your music. As someone who put this feature to the test while\ntraveling, it was surprisingly useful.\n\nNoise-canceling aside, these headphones are comfortable to wear for extended\nperiods of time and sound very good overall. The audio quality wasn't as high\nas some other pairs I've heard, but noise canceling actually does color the\nsound a little bit. Still, it's a fair trade-off for such a nice feature. \u2014\n_Brandt Ranj_\n\n **Pros:** Excellent noise canceling, comfortable to wear for hours\n\n **Cons:** Audio quality takes a little hit\n\n### [Buy the Sony WH1000XM3 headphones on Amazon for\n$348](https://amzn.to/2Lp00GY)\n\n## The best looking wireless headphones\n\n[ ![bower & wilkins px](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg\nxmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://i.insider.com/5c17dadfd4beaf4d816253bb?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp)\nBower & Wilkins  ](https://amzn.to/2QYta55)\n\n### If you really care about headphone aesthetics, it's hard to recommend any\nother pair over [Bower & Wilkin's PX Wireless](https://amzn.to/2QYta55).\n\nThis is the only pair of headphones that I haven't tried personally, kind of.\nI owned the wired version before but never made the leap to this Bluetooth\nmodel.

Instead,\nthey have a microphone that picks up noise around you, and the headphones play\na sound opposite to that noise to block it out. It's a pretty neat concept\nthat has given rise to tons of noise cancelling headphones that are great for\ntravel or simply getting a bit of peace and quiet.\n\n **Here are the best noise cancelling headphones you can buy:**\n\n  *  **Best headphones overall: [Bose QuietComfort 35 II](https://amzn.to/2OzY8vW)**\n  *  **Best on-ear noise cancelling headphones: [AKG N60 NC](https://amzn.to/2pmiD4t)**\n  *  **Best in-ear noise cancelling headphones: [Bose QuietComfort 30](https://amzn.to/2POWaIe)  \n**\n\n  *  **Best affordable headphones: [Audio Technica ATH-ANC7b](https://amzn.to/2NXc5Hc)  \n**\n\n  *  **Best-sounding headphones: [Sennheiser HD 1 Wireless](https://amzn.to/2pngSDU)**\n\n* * *\n\n### [The best earbuds you can buy](https://www.businessinsider.com/best-\nearbuds)\n\nEarbuds need to be well constructed to deliver the same kind of audio quality\nyou'd expect out of a bigger pair of headphones. Master & Dynamic pulled it\noff with the [ME05 earbuds](http://amzn.to/2x4RzJN). They are still the best\nearbuds I've used, delivering excellent sound quality in a nice, neat package.\n\nYou should also consider the [iFrogz Impulse Duo\nearbuds](http://amzn.to/2ydBDVS), the [Pioneer Rayz Lightning\nEarbuds](http://amzn.to/2h8gLrt), the [Etymotic ER4SR Studio Reference In-Ear\nMonitors](http://amzn.to/2foi3i3), and the [Apple\nAirpods](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&mid=38606&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-\nairpods-white%2F5577872.p%3FskuId%3D5577872&u1=1073551387.1500048334).\n\n* * *\n\n### [The best on-ear headphones you can\nbuy](https://www.businessinsider.com/best-on-ear-headphones/)\n\nOn-ear headphones give you great sound in a portable package that's\ncomfortable to wear. [Master & Dynamic's MW50](http://amzn.to/2wLzlvk) are the\nbest on-ear headphones we've tested yet. They're an investment, but you'll\nappreciate these headphones more each day, as you rediscover favorite songs\nand fully appreciate new ones.\n\n[Koss' Porta Pro headphones](http://amzn.to/2x1JOYk) are a great budget\noption, [Plantronics' Backbeats 500](http://amzn.to/2yvinTN) are incredibly\nconvenient, [Bowers & Wilkins' P5 headphones](http://amzn.to/2x2pfGt) are\nbeautiful, and [Grado's SR80 headphones](http://amzn.to/2xyQvNF) are a little\ndifferent than what you're used to.\n\n* * *\n\n### [The best headphones under $100](https://www.businessinsider.com/best-\nheadphones-under-100)\n\nIf you don't mind wires, [Status Audio's CB1\nheadphones](http://amzn.to/2vvmKf1) offer the best audio quality I've heard in\nheadphones costing less than $100. The headphones themselves are comfortable\nwhen listening for extended periods of time, and unlike most studio monitor-\nstyle headphones, the cable is manageable.\n\nYou should also consider the [Sony MDR7506 Professional\nheadphones](http://amzn.to/2vcUpid), the [iFrogz Impulse Duo\nearbuds](http://amzn.to/2wvaRuc), the [Plantronics BackBeat 500\nheadphones](http://amzn.to/2vdffhB), and the [Grado SR80e\nheadphones](http://amzn.to/2xyQvNF).\n\n[Subscribe to our newsletter.](http://e.businessinsider.com/join/ci/insider-\npicks)  \n  \nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by the [Insider\nPicks](http://www.businessinsider.com/insiderpicks) team.
