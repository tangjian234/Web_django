So if you\u2019re looking to get a new pair of in-ear\nheadphones with mic, here\u2019s a brief breakdown of what to look for in a mic\nthat makes your buying worth it.\n\nAsk yourself these **key questions** to help you make an informed choice:\n\n  * How does a mic work?\n  * What makes a good mic?\n  * Do the earbuds come with noise-canceling technology in the mic?\n  * Where is the mic located and how far is it away from the mouth?\n  * Are the earbuds a good snug fit in your ear?\n\n###  **How Does a Mic Work?**\n\nA microphone works by converting [sound\nwaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound) (acoustic energy) into [audio\nsignals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal). This conversion process\nmay vary based on the type of microphone, but they all have one common feature\n\u2014 [the diaphragm](https://mynewmicrophone.com/diaphragm/), a thin membrane\nthat vibrates in reaction to external sound waves.\n\n![Illustration of how a microphone works \\(From: Tech In\nTangent\\)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201100%20750'%3E%3C/svg%3E)Illustration\nof how a microphone works  \n(From: Tech In Tangent)\n\nWithout it, the microphone cannot fulfill its function as a\n[transducer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer) \u2014 converting converts\nenergy from one form to another. The vibration from the diaphragm causes the\nother microphone components to vibrate, which are then converted into\nelectrical currents that become the audio signal.\n\nThe loudspeaker at the other end of the audio chain is also a transducer \u2014\nconverting the audio signal\u2019s electrical currents back into acoustical energy,\nwhich is the sound coming from the earbuds.\n\n> A microphone\u2019s diaphragm picks up sounds and converts them into electrical\n> currents, similar to how we use our diagrams to sing\n\n###  **Types of Mics Used in Earbuds**\n\nThere are two most popular technologies used for constructing the microphones\nused for earbuds \u2014\n\n  *  **Electret Condenser Microphones (ECM)**\n  *  **Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS)**.\n\nBoth operate by causing a shift in electrical properties through the\ndeflection of the diaphragm, which acts as a capacitor plate. The converted\nenergy is then amplified to deliver an audio signal which is picked up by the\nhost system. In the case of MEMS microphones, however, the variation is\nconverted and encoded.\n\n#### Difference Between ECM and MEMS\n\nDespite the operational similarities, ECM and MEMS technologies are actually\nquite different.\n\n  1. MEMS microphones are newer to the market and come in smaller package sizes, making them ideal for smaller devices. This feature is also what enables true wireless earbuds to have internal mics.\n\n  1. They also feature relatively lower [output impedance](https://www.headphonesty.com/2019/04/headphone-impedance-demystified/), which makes them the ideal choice in electrically noisy environments.\n\n  1. That said, ECMs remain a practical choice since their larger sizes make it easier to facilitate design upgrades and source solutions for dust and moisture protection.\n\n> MEMS microphones have more advantages, which is why they are used across\n> several products today, such as smartphones, headphones, tablets, hearing\n> aids, and cars among others.\n\n###  **What Makes a Good Mic?**\n\nThere are a few things as frustrating as having to repeat yourself over and\nover because the other person on the phone can\u2019t hear what you. That\u2019s why\nit\u2019s important to understand the factors that define a good mic. These\ninclude:\n\n####  **Voice Pickup**\n\nThis refers to the microphone\u2019s ability to pick up voice with **appropriate\nvolume** and **clarity**. Some higher-end earbuds come with an integrated\nvoice assistant option that lets you talk to your phone\u2019s voice-controlled\npersonal assistant (Siri, Cortana, or Alexa), without actually using the\nphone.\n\nThe voice assistant picks up your voice when you utter a set of voice commands\nand executes them without you having to touch or swipe anything on your phone.\nThis makes it ideal for driving, working out, cooking, and just about any\nactivity that requires you to work with your hands a lot.\n\nThe **frequency range** and **sensitivity** of the microphone are crucial in\ndetermining the quality of the voice pickup. If you frequently need to \u201ctalk\u201d\nto your voice assistant during the course of your day, then you\u2019ll want to go\nfor a mic that is sensitive and had a wide frequency range.\n\nHaving a very sensitive mic can have downsides because it can pick up a lot of\nsurrounding sound. This is where noise filtering comes in.\n\n####  **Noise Filtering**\n\nHaving a noise-filtering mic is a definite must, especially if you need to use\nit in a noisy environment. In addition to filtering out the background noise,\nit should also isolate your voice, allowing the receiver to hear you clearly\nwithout you having to talk out loud.\n\n##### Noise filtering at the chip level\n\nAt the chip level, the type of mic in the microphone can (ECM or MEMS) help\nout with noise filtering. As previously mentioned, the relatively lower output\nimpedance of MEMS microphones allows for better noise filtering than ECM\nmicrophones.\n\n##### Active Noise Cancellation Mic\n\nBefore we go any further into [Active Noise Cancellation\n(ANC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_noise_control) works, you should\nknow this feature is usually used misleading in the product specifications.\n\nSometimes manufacturers will advertise their headphones as _active noise\ncanceling_ headphones and state that it has cVc noise-cancellation technology.\nIs that true? **No.**\n\n **cVc is the mic\u2019s ANC technology**. It specifically deals with the noise\ncoming through the mic and also the voice clarity.\n\nDon\u2019t confuse the ANC for mic and the ANC technology in headphones such as\n[Bose\nQC35](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-\nii.html) and [Sony\nWH-1000XM3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G4MNFS1/?tag=headphonesty0420-20).\nThose are used to reduce noise so that they can enjoy their music in peace.\n\n#####  **How Does ANC Work?**\n\nANC technology works based on the concept of [Digital Signal Processing\n(DSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing)), which\ninvolves analyzing and modifying real-world signals like voice, audio, and\nvideo to optimize their efficiency. For ANC to work, the [earbuds need to have\nmultiple mics receiving sounds at a different\ndistance](https://www.jabra.com/blog/noise-cancellation-in-headsets-what-\nexactly-is-it/).\n\nThe mic closest to your mouth picks up your voice while others pick up on the\nsurrounding noise and filter it out through DSP, leaving just your voice. This\nis done through [special converters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-\ndigital_converter) that take analog signals and digitizes them to produce a\nhigher quality signal than the original. A good example is the [Jabra Elite\nActive 65t](https://www.headphonesty.com/2019/06/review-jabra-elite-\nactive-65t/) wireless earbuds, which feature a 4-mic system for more efficient\nANC.\n\nYou can read more about [DSP here](https://www.shure.com/en-US/performance-\nproduction/louder/the-fundamentals-of-digital-signal-processing-3).\n\nSome examples of ANC technology include:\n\n  * [ **Clear Voice Capture (cVc) by Qualcomm**](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/features/cvc-noise-cancellation-technology) \u2014 cVc\u2019s technology works on the transmission and receiving path of voice calls for optimum noise suppression and voice quality across wireless communications.\n\n  * [ **Jabra Noise Blackout\u2122**](https://www.jabra.ca/Support/~/media/5766F0529161467E968DFC2C42E4A894.ashx) \u2014 Jabra products use their own proprietary tech to ensure a crystal clear and noise-free quality of the uplink of the audio on their wireless headsets. It leverages DSP to optimize their digital transmission systems for greater noise reduction on digitized audio signals.\n\n####  **Position of the Mic**\n\nThis varies with the design of the earbuds. The premise here is pretty\nstraightforward \u2014 **the closer the distance of the mic to the mouth** , **the\nclearer the voice pickup** would be and **the lesser the ambient noise** from\nthe environment. Some earbuds have mics that are positioned inline on the\ncable, which might be too far away from the mouth and resulting in poor voice\ntransmission.\n\n![\\(From: Snap\nGoods\\)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201100%20749'%3E%3C/svg%3E)(From:\nSnap Goods)\n\n####  **Comfort and Fit**\n\nIf you are looking for in-ear headphones with mic, chances are you\u2019ll be\nwearing them for long, so you\u2019ll want to choose those that are comfortable and\nfit snugly for easy calling. Use the earbuds and test the mic for about 10 to\n20 minutes before deciding about comfort.\n\nConsider the design and weight as well. For instance, if you\u2019re using wired\nearbuds with mic on your morning jog, then you\u2019ll have to be wary about\nentangling the cable with your movements. In terms of the weight; ideally, the\nlighter the comfier.\n\n> Earbuds with a great fit usually provide a better seal, which allows the\n> listener to hear and communicate clearly.\n\n##  **FAQ**\n\n###  **Is there a microphone on earbuds?**\n\nThere sure are! True wireless earbuds like the Jabra Elite Active 65t and the\nApple AirPods Pro even come with multiple microphones in each earbud which are\nthen used for calls and voice commands.\n\n###  **How do I use my earphones as a mic?**\n\nMicrophones and earphones both operate on the principle of the vibrating\ndiaphragms in reaction to external soundwaves, which then convert sound into\nelectrical signals and back to sound again. This means you can use your\nearphones as a mic. That being said, the audio quality from your earphone-\nturned-mic will be nowhere near the quality if you used an actual microphone.\n\n###  **How does the microphone on earbuds work?**\n\nA microphone is basically a transducer \u2014 a device that converts energy into a\ndifferent form. In this case, it converts acoustic energy from your voice into\naudio signals which are then transmitted to the person on the other end of the\nline.\n\nNow the loudspeaker through which that person hears your voice is also a\ntransducer, converting the transmitted audio signal back into acoustic energy.\nThis conversion happens rapidly so it just seems like you\u2019re hearing each\nother\u2019s voices, which in fact a series of ultra-fast conversions are taking\nplace in real-time.\n\n###  **How can I test my earphone mic?**\n\nThere\u2019s different ways to test the mic on your earphones. The simplest way is\nto connect it to your phone and make a call. If the other person on the end of\nthe line can hear you clearly, then you\u2019re all set. You can also [test the mic\non your computer](https://www.dummies.com/computers/pcs/test-the-microphone-\non-your-windows-pc/) or use this [online mic\ntest](https://www.onlinemictest.com/) to confirm that your mic has been set up\nproperly.\n\n##  **Conclusion**\n\nChoosing the best earbuds with microphone is no cakewalk as there\u2019s just so\nmany considerations between you and an informed choice. Nevertheless, we hope\nthis guide has been informative and insightful enough to at least help you\nnarrow your options and decide on the perfect earbuds with mic for you.\n\nNeed more information about a particular set of earbuds?
