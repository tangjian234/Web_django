For some people, however, Bluetooth headsets that are less bulky and only\nfocus on delivering a great hands-free phone call experience are a better\npurchase. Especially if you're now working from home, a headset is an easy way\nto stay on top of your work in a distracting environment. We think the\n[Plantronics Voyager Legend](https://www.amazon.com/Plantronics-Voyager-\nWireless-Bluetooth-\nHeadset/dp/B00DQ5NU76?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU67768YYw) is\nthe best overall choice, but there are plenty of other options on this list\nworth considering.\n\n  * Best Overall: _Plantronics Voyager Legend_\n  * Best Budget Pick: _New Bee Bluetooth Earpiece_\n  * Best for Multiple Phones: _YAMAY Bluetooth Headset_\n  * Best Noise-Cancellation: _BlueParrott B450-XT_\n  * Best Premium Headset: _Sennheiser Presence UC_\n  * Best for Durability: _Jabra Steel_\n\n## Best Overall: _Plantronics Voyager Legend_\n\n![Plantronics Voyager\nLegend](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/1x1.png)![Plantronics\nVoyager\nLegend](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/08/plantronics-\nvoyager-legend-hero.jpg?itok=3DuyUgiy)_Source: Plantronics_\n\nThere's a surprising amount of Bluetooth headsets still kicking around in\n2019, and among them all, we think the best pick for most people is the\nPlantronics Voyager Legend. The Voyager isn't the most premium Bluetooth\nheadset out there, but we think it offers the best overall experience and\nvalue.\n\nPlantronics' design for the Voyager Legend is simple and minimalistic in all\nthe right ways. It hooks over your ear with ease, and thanks to Smart Sensor\nTechnology, the Voyager Legend can automatically detect when it's being worn.\nIn real-world use, this means you can accept a call just by placing the\nheadset on your ear without having to press any buttons.\n\nOther highlights include a triple-mic array that cancels out unwanted\nbackground noise, a nano-coating that allows for water resistance, and a\nbattery that's rated to last for up to seven hours of talk time on one charge.\nWhen you aren't using the Voyager Legend, it tucks away nicely in the premium\ncarrying case.\n\nA lot is being offered here, and for the price Plantronics is asking, you're\ngetting one heck of a deal.\n\n### Pros:\n\n  * Simple design\n  * Noise cancellation\n  * Wear detection\n  * Water resistance\n\n### Cons:\n\n  * Relatively short battery life\n\n### Best Overall\n\n[\n![](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/16x9.png)![](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/small/public/article_images/2019/08/plantronics-\nvoyager-legend-cropped.png) ](https://www.amazon.com/Plantronics-Voyager-\nWireless-Bluetooth-\nHeadset/dp/B00DQ5NU76?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU67768YYw)\n\n####  [Plantronics Voyager Legend](https://www.amazon.com/Plantronics-Voyager-\nWireless-Bluetooth-\nHeadset/dp/B00DQ5NU76?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU67768YYw)\n\nBest of the best\n\nFor most people, the Voyager Legend is the best Bluetooth headset money can\nbuy.

This is\nthe most affordable headset we picked out, and while it may not offer the\nabsolute best experience, the value proposition that's offered is tough to\nargue with.\n\nThe design of New Bee's headset isn't anything special. The plastic over-ear\ndesign gets the job done, but it doesn't go any further than that. It's\nperfectly functional and comfortable, but pizazz is not a word in its\nvocabulary (although the white and gold colors do spice things up just a\nlittle bit).\n\nNew Bee includes additional earbud tips to help you get the perfect fit, CVC\n6.0 technology is present to help eliminate background noise for crystal clear\ncalls, and you can expect 24 hours of talk time with charging taking between\n2-3 hours.\n\nThat's quite the package for such a low price, and as icing on the cake, New\nBee goes as far as to include a three-year warranty just in case anything goes\nwrong.\n\n### Pros:\n\n  * Comfortable and lightweight\n  * Additional earbud tips\n  * Noise-canceling\n  * Extremely affordable\n  * Three-year warranty\n\n### Cons:\n\n  * Uninspired design\n  * Not the greatest sound quality\n  * Short battery life\n\n### Best Budget Pick\n\n[\n![](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/1x1.png)![](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/small/public/article_images/2019/08/new-\nbee-bluetooth-headset-cropped.png) ](https://www.amazon.com/New-bee-Bluetooth-\nCancelling-\nHeadsetcase/dp/B07FMSJZ3R?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU67768YYw)\n\n####  [New Bee Bluetooth Earpiece](https://www.amazon.com/New-bee-Bluetooth-\nCancelling-\nHeadsetcase/dp/B07FMSJZ3R?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU67768YYw)\n\nFor tight budgets\n\nTrying to save as much money as possible?

YAMAY's headset crams in\njust about everything you could ask for, and it does so at a price that's\nquite compelling.\n\nRight off the bat, this is a really solid design. The headset is lightweight\nand comfortable to wear, the soft ear pads make long phone calls a breeze, and\nthe flexible headband allows people of all head shapes/sizes to wear the\nheadset with ease. It's bulkier than other options on this list, but it\nshouldn't cause a strain.\n\nOne of the best features of the YAMAY headset is the ability to pair it with\ntwo devices at once, allowing you to seamlessly switch back and forth between\ntwo different Bluetooth connections. If you have a work and personal phone,\nthis could come in handy a lot.\n\nYou'll also be treated to a battery that lasts for up to 17 hours of talk\ntime, and a handy charging cradle where you can store the headset when you\ndon't need to use it, and a competitive price tag.\n\n### Pros:\n\n  * Flexible headband and easy to wear\n  * Can be connected to two devices at once\n  * Fantastic sound quality\n  * Good battery life\n\n### Cons:\n\n  * Bulkier than other headsets\n\n### Best for Multiple Phones\n\n[\n![](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/3x4.png)![](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/small/public/article_images/2019/08/yamay-\nbluetooth-headset-cropped.png) ](https://www.amazon.com/YAMAY-Bluetooth-\nCancelling-Headphones-\nMicrophone/dp/B07L13Y3K2?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU67768YYw)\n\n####  [YAMAY Bluetooth Headset](https://www.amazon.com/YAMAY-Bluetooth-\nCancelling-Headphones-\nMicrophone/dp/B07L13Y3K2?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU67768YYw)\n\nGet this if you have multiple phones\n\nIf you take calls from more than one phone, you need the YAMAY Bluetooth\nHeadset \u2014 it can be connected to two phones at once!\n\n  * [$41 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/YAMAY-Bluetooth-Cancelling-Headphones-Microphone/dp/B07L13Y3K2?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU67768YYw)\n  * [$128 at Walmart](/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F612734%2F9383%3Fsharedid%3D159229%26subId1%3DUUacUdUnU67768YYw%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FWireless-Office-Bluetooth-Headset-Microphone-Buiseness-Mic-Driver-Time-Pro-Clear-Smartphones-Noise-Button-Mute-Home-19H-Call-Charging-Center-Truck-Ta%252F391276974&token=kETT2d9t)\n\n## Best Noise-Cancellation: _BlueParrott B450-XT_\n\n![BlueParrot\nB450-XT](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/1x1.png)![BlueParrot\nB450-XT](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/08/blueparrott-b450-xt-\nhero.jpg?itok=zc-4gfXN)_Source: BlueParrot_\n\nIf you're a truck driver or someone that deals with a lot of background noise,\nchances are you want a Bluetooth headset that can block out as much sound as\npossible. If that sounds like you, the BlueParrott B45-XT is a great pick-up.\n\nThis is far from being a compact headset, but that bulky design has a purpose.\nDo you see that huge earpiece and microphone? With this setup, BlueParrot says\nthe B45-XT is capable of canceling out 96% of all background sound. Seriously.\n\nIn addition to the powerful noise-cancellation, the B450-XT also comes\nequipped with incredible sound quality, a comfortable design, Bluetooth 4.0,\nthe ability to connect up to two devices at once, and over 24 hours of talk\ntime.\n\nYou'll pay a pretty penny for the B450-XT, but considering everything you're\ngetting, it's money well spent.\n\n### Pros:\n\n  * Unmatched noise-cancellation\n  * Powerful sound\n  * Comfortable\n  * Pairs with two devices at once\n  * 24+ hours of battery life\n\n### Cons:\n\n  * Bulky\n  * High price\n\n### Best Noise-Cancellation\n\n[\n![](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/3x4.png)![](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/small/public/article_images/2019/08/blueparrott-b450-xt-\ncropped.png) ](https://www.amazon.com/BlueParrott-B450-XT-Canceling-Bluetooth-\nHeadset/dp/B01M3MMFA5?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU67768YYw)\n\n####  [BlueParrott B450-XT](https://www.amazon.com/BlueParrott-B450-XT-\nCanceling-Bluetooth-\nHeadset/dp/B01M3MMFA5?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU67768YYw)\n\nBlock out the world around you\n\nFor people that need to take calls in noisy environments, the BlueParrott\nB45-XT is the clear choice (even with its high price).\n\n  * [$130 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/BlueParrott-B450-XT-Canceling-Bluetooth-Headset/dp/B01M3MMFA5?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU67768YYw)\n  * [$140 at Walmart](/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F612734%2F9383%3Fsharedid%3D159229%26subId1%3DUUacUdUnU67768YYw%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FBlueParrott-B450-XT-Premium-Noise-Canceling-Bluetooth-Headset%252F217107808&token=w8I-3zrV)\n  * [$149 at B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1294493-REG/vxi_204010_b450_xt_blueparrot_bluetooth_mobile.html/BI/20079/KBID/13844/SID/UUacUdUnU67768YYw)\n\n## Best Premium Headset: _Sennheiser Presence UC_\n\n![Sennheiser Presence\nUN](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/4x3.png)![Sennheiser\nPresence\nUN](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/08/sennheiser-\npresence-uc-hero.jpg?itok=X8u8QIsE)_Source: Sennheiser_\n\nSome of you reading this list are likely budget-conscious and don't want to\nthrow too much money at your next Bluetooth headset. However, if you happen to\nbe on the opposite end of the spectrum and don't have a budget you need to\nstick to, the Sennheiser Presence UC is worth splurging for.\n\nThis is one of the smallest Bluetooth headsets we've found, and for folks that\nare always on the go, that's a huge benefit. You also get access to\nSennheiser's SpeakFocus technology that uses three digital microphones to\nenhance the quality of your voice no matter what kind of environment you're\nin.

This\nruggedized headset is designed to withstand quite a beating and keep on\nchugging without any problems, and for some people reading this, that's\nexactly what they need.\n\nThe Jabra Steel is rated for resistance against dust, water, and shock with an\nIP54 rating. If one of these elements does damage the headset somehow, you're\ncovered by an impressive five-year warranty.\n\nOn the technical side of things, the Jabra Elite is outfitted with dual\nmicrophones for clear phone calls even in the noisiest of environments. It\nworks with Siri and Google Assistant if that's your jam, and NFC allows for\neasy pairing. We also like the ability to have the Elite simultaneously\nconnected to two devices at once, but the six-hour battery isn't the best the\nmarket has to offer.\n\n### Pros:\n\n  * Extremely rugged design\n  * Five-year warranty\n  * Clear sound quality\n  * Can be connected to two devices at once\n  * Connects with Siri, Google Assistant\n\n### Cons:\n\n  * Unimpressive battery life\n\n### Best for Durability\n\n[\n![](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/1x1.png)![](https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/small/public/article_images/2019/08/jabra-\nsteel-cropped.png) ](https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Ruggedized-Bluetooth-\nHeadset-\nVersion/dp/B0194VYPQ0?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU67768YYw)\n\n####  [Jabra Steel](https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Ruggedized-Bluetooth-Headset-\nVersion/dp/B0194VYPQ0?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU67768YYw)\n\nReady for anything you throw at it\n\nThis world is filled with plenty of butterfingers, and if you're one of them,\nthe Jabra Steel headset is a smart purchase.\n\n  * [$65 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Ruggedized-Bluetooth-Headset-Version/dp/B0194VYPQ0?tag=androidcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU67768YYw)\n  * [$65 at Walmart](/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F612734%2F9383%3Fsharedid%3D159229%26subId1%3DUUacUdUnU67768YYw%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FJabra-Steel-Ruggedized-Bluetooth-Headset-US-Version-Black%252F291645856&token=vC5D7gXu)\n  * [$100 at Newegg](/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3DUUacUdUnU67768YYw%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fp%252F0G6-0006-001J9&token=3Rezd-ah)\n\n## Bottom line\n\nAs you can see, the Bluetooth headset market is chock-full of some pretty\ngreat options.
