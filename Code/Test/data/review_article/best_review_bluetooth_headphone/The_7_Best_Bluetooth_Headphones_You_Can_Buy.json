sizes, and the sound quality\nsatisfies everyone except the keenest of audiophiles. Yes, it\u2019s one more thing\nto charge, but it\u2019s just so convenient to not need a wire. Still, finding the\nright pair of Bluetooth headphones isn\u2019t easy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are several options when it comes to choosing [the best headphones for\nyour budget](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-make-sure-you-buy-the-best-\nheadphones-for-your-budget/)[ How To Make Sure You Buy The Best Headphones For\nYour Budget How do you determine the \"best\" pair of headphones then?

This article will help you find the perfect pair of Bluetooth\nheadphones for any price, from cheapest to most expensive.\n\n## Glossary of Headphone Terms\n\nThere are a few [things to know before buying Bluetooth\nheadphones:](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/buying-wireless-headphones-here-\nare-6-things-you-need-to-know/)\n\n  * **On-Ear:** On-ear or supra-aural headphones sit on your ears, without wrapping them from the top, bottom, or sides.\n  * **Over-Ear:** Over-ear or circum-aural headphones completely wrap your ears from all sides, creating a seal.\n  * **In-Ear:** In-ear headphones plug into your ear canals. They are not earbuds, which sit in your ears without blocking the holes.\n  * **AptX:** AptX is a compression technology to transfer audio data from your smartphone or tablet to the Bluetooth headphones. It used to be more important earlier but isn\u2019t as crucial with headphones made in the last couple of years.\n\nIf you still feel lost check out these [headphone terms everyone needs to\nknow](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-terms-you-should-know-to-identify-the-best-\nheadphones/).\n\n## 1\\.

The cheapest\nheadphones you should get are the [JLab Audio\nNeons](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTLUYHL). These are also among the few\nheadphones at this price that fold up for easy portability.\n\nThis pair offers a balanced sound profile that\u2019s good for anyone who listens\nto rock or pop. As you might expect, they don\u2019t have a thumping bass, but that\nwas always going to be a trade-off at such a low price. While some wired\nheadphones at the same price would sound better, the JLab Neons are one of\n[the best headphones priced under $50](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-quality-\nheadphones-cost-50/)[ 5 Quality Headphones That Cost Less Than $50 Owning a\nquality pair of headphones is very important for anyone who wants or needs to\nlisten to music by themselves on a regular basis.

Even at this low price, they give you about 10 hours of\ncontinuous playback, which is comparable with phones that cost twice or thrice\nas much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## 2\\.

The Jabra Moves offer quality sound, low cost, solid construction, and a\ncomfortable fit when listening for extended hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fit is a crucial feature of headphones. If you like on-ear, then the\nMoves\u2019 soft padding and swiveling cups will feel comfortable for extended\nusage. The band and cups don\u2019t press hard on your head or ears respectively,\nand the controls are easy to reach.\n\nThe Jabra Move headphones\u2019 battery lasts for about 8 hours. Plus, in case you\nrun out of juice, there\u2019s a standard 3.5mm audio jack for you to use these as\nwired headphones.\n\nAs for audio quality, the Moves punch above their weight class. Rich bass,\nhigh volume, and clear sharps make these sound good whether you\u2019re listening\nto AC/DC or Yo-Yo Ma. I have personally owned a pair of Jabra Move headphones\nfor years, and can recommend them.\n\nThese are a no-brainer choice for anyone who wants the features and the feel\nof high-end Bluetooth headphones without paying a high-end price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## 3\\.

The [BackBeat FIT 500](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075ZD5Q1D) headphones\ndon\u2019t cost the Earth, but still sound good, have a long battery, and can\nhandle the rough use of a workout.\n\nWhat makes these workout headphones is a nano-coating that makes them water-\nresistant (not waterproof). This means you can wear these while sweating\nprofusely or during a run in a light shower, but don\u2019t take them out in heavy\nrain.\n\nIt\u2019s important to get the FIT 500\u2019S fit right. Even though these are exercise\nheadphones, they tend to slide off your head if you push the band back beyond\nthe top of your dome. I\u2019d suggest putting them on a little tighter than you\nusually wear headphones, and making sure the band is right on the top of your\nhead.\n\nApart from that, the sound quality, battery life, and other essential elements\nwill be good enough for most people. Unless you\u2019re an audiophile, the\nPlantronics BackBeat FIT 500s are one of [the best exercise headphones money\ncan buy](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-sports-exercise-headphones-2016/).\n\n## 4\\.

They don\u2019t sound as good as the Jabra Moves, but you won\u2019t find\nsuch good noise cancellation at this price.\n\nThe CB3 Hush headphones are excellent for people who need a set of Bluetooth\nheadphones for travel. Whether you want to cut out the background noise of\nyour daily commute or the continuous low hum during a flight, the Hushes do it\nwith aplomb.\n\nThe audio quality is a hit-or-miss affair though. The CB3 Hushes are fine for\npop songs, classical music, or movies and podcasts. But if you listen to songs\nthat require rich reproduction, these headphones can\u2019t quite cope.\n\nThe CB3 Hush headphones are more about giving you active noise cancellation,\nBluetooth, a long battery life (over 12 hours), and decent audio, while\nkeeping the price under $100. It\u2019s difficult to find [affordable noise-\ncancelling headphones](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-affordable-noise-cancelling-\nheadphones-every-student-should-consider/), especially with Bluetooth, so\nthese are a good jack-of-all-trades purchase.\n\n## 5\\.

And there is\nalso a 3.5mm audio port so you can listen to them when the battery runs out.\n\nHowever, the best part is the way these fit. The JBL Duets feel comfortable\neven when you wear them for several hours. There is no ear sweat, no clamping\npressure, and no sliding of the headband. These are a clear winner for those\nwho want headphones that cost under $100.\n\n## 6\\.

And the [Sennheiser HD\n4.50](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSZSL4I/) headphones should be your first\nchoice.\n\nThe HD 4.50s don\u2019t boast the best fit, which means they\u2019ll take some time to\nget used to. The design of the headband makes the cans clamp tight on your\nears; if you loosen the headband, it falls off. However, over time, you\u2019ll\nfigure out just the right adjustments for your head, and then get to enjoy the\nHD 4.50s for what they do best: noise cancellation and sound quality.\n\nFew headphones at this price balance noise cancellation and sound like the\nSennheiser HD 4.50s. They actually sound like a pair that rivals the Bose\nQuietComfort 35 IIs, which cost nearly twice the price. The noise cancellation\nis top-notch, the sound is balanced, the battery life is excellent, and\nthere\u2019s nothing apart from the fit to complain about.\n\nIf the fit is a big problem for you consider instead the Plantronics BackBeat\nPro 2s:\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MCRVPO6)\n\n[Plantronics BackBeat PRO 2 Special Edition - Wireless Noise Canceling\nHeadphones](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MCRVPO6?tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1)\n[Plantronics BackBeat PRO 2 Special Edition - Wireless Noise Canceling\nHeadphones](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MCRVPO6?tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1)[\nBuy Now On Amazon\n](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MCRVPO6?tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1)$90.93\n\nThe [Plantronics BackBeat Pro 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MCRVPO6)\nheadphones were first released in 2016, but their continuing popularity shows\nhow good they are. Despite looking big and bulky, they are surprisingly light\nwhen you put them on. Plus, they boast an impressive 24 hours of battery life.\nHowever, the sound quality doesn\u2019t match up to the Sennheiser HD 4.50s, and\nthey don\u2019t fold, so they are much more cumbersome to carry around.\n\n## 7\\.

But\nreviewers are split between which of these two similarly-priced models you\nshould choose: the [Sony WH-1000XM2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074KDJVS2) or\nthe [Sony WH-H900N](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074W5BKPH/). Everyone has a\ndifferent opinion, so here\u2019s what sets them apart:\n\n  * **Noise cancellation:** The WH-1000XM2s have better noise cancellation than the WH-H900Ns.\n  * **Design and Portability:** Both the headphones look and feel similar, so this shouldn\u2019t be a big factor in your decision. But note that the WH-1000XM2s come with their own hard case, while you\u2019ll have to buy a case separately for the WH-H900Ns.\n  * **Sound quality:** The WH-H900Ns beat the WH-1000XM2s here with better mids and a deeper bass.\n  * **Call quality:** The microphone on the WH-H900Ns picks up your voice easily in noisy environments. The microphone on the WH-1000XM2s isn\u2019t bad either, but it will pick up ambient noise.\n\nA simpler way of look at it is this: Buy the Sony WH-1000XM2 headphones if\nnoise cancellation matters more, buy the Sony WH-H900N headphones if audio\naccuracy matters more.\n\n## What About the Best Bluetooth Earphones?\n\nYou may be surprised that Bose didn\u2019t make the list this time, but it appears\nthat other brands of headphones have caught up or surpassed Bose now. This\narticle should help you pick up the best Bluetooth headphones for your budget.\nBut things are different if you\u2019re looking for earphones instead of\nheadphones.\n\nRight now, most reviewers are fans of the [Sennheiser\nHD1s](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MR84GHV), the [Jabra Elite\n65ts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077ZGRVRX), and the [BeatsX\nearphones](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWL8VCS).
