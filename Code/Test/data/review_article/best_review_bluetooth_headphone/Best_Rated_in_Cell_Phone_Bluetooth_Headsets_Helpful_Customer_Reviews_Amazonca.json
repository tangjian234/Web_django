The headband and ear cushion were soft and comfortable, I've\nhad it on for around 5-6 hours constantly and it doesn't bother me at all. (I\nhave them on right now as I'm writing this review).  \n  \nI can't pin-point how long the battery lasts, but its safe to say it lasts at\nleast one full day WITH ANC on.  \n  \nNext up, the sound quality and ANC is a bliss to my ears. You can hear the\nTremble and Bass (try playing different genre and you can tell the\ndifference), and even WITHOUT turning on the ANC, it is quite quiet when you\nhave the headphones on, but not to the point where you cannot have a\nconversation.  \nWhen someone is talking to me, I'll turn OFF the ANC button and I can hear\nthem\n\n[ Read more ](/gp/customer-\nreviews/R25YYN8HBCXY7L?ref_=fspcr_pl_sr_2_5_1_3379571011)\n\nBy Ivan\n\n[ __Product is user friendly, good quality and meets expectations.\n](/gp/customer-reviews/R35KC51CR8PIB2?ref_=fspcr_pl_sr_3_5_1_3379571011)\n\nA very great product. In the few days that I\u2019ve had it I\u2019ve charged it once\n(when it first arrived), and the display I see when connected to my phone\ntells me it\u2019s not even close to dying yet.  \n  \nVery user friendly and not complex. On the right speaker, the power button\npauses and unpauses music and the volume buttons can be used to change songs.\nAlso, connects very fast to my phones Bluetooth and my laptop\u2019s Bluetooth\n(this is preamble because I\u2019ve had problems connecting other Bluetooth audio\ndevices to that particular laptop).  \n  \nOn the left speaker there\u2019s an ANC switch. When switched on, I can only heard\nvery load noises through the headphones. Truth be told, when it\u2019s off the\nheadphones by themselves still do a good job of blocking out noise.  \n  \nThe headphones are also very comfy and fit well.  \n  \nI\u2019ll be buying from MPOW again in the future.\n\n[ Read more ](/gp/customer-\nreviews/R35KC51CR8PIB2?ref_=fspcr_pl_sr_3_5_1_3379571011)\n\nBy Kadeem Edwards\n\n[ See all customer reviews  ](/Mpow-Cancelling-Headphones-Microphone-Memory-\nProtein/product-reviews/B07Z4N2M2B?ref_=fspcr_pl_ar_1_3379571011)\n\nFast, FREE delivery, video streaming, music, and much more\n\nPrime members enjoy Free Two-Day Shipping, Free Same-Day or One-Day Delivery\nto select areas, Prime Video, Prime Music, Prime Reading, and more.\n\n> [Get started](/prime)\n\n[](/gp/prime)\n\n[ ![True Wireless Earbuds, VANKYO X200 Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds in-Ear TWS Stereo\nHeadphones with Smart LED Display Charging...](https://images-na.ssl-images-\namazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif)![True Wireless Earbuds,\nVANKYO X200 Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds in-Ear TWS Stereo Headphones with Smart LED\nDisplay Charging...](https://m.media-\namazon.com/images/I/61fPdBkEc9L._AC_SX500_SY500_.jpg) ](/Wireless-Bluetooth-\nHeadphones-Charging-Waterproof/dp/B07ZQCST89?ref_=fspcr_pl_dp_2_3379571011)\n\n[ True Wireless Earbuds, VANKYO X200 Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds in-Ear TWS Stereo\nHeadphones with Smart LED Display Charging Case IPX8 Waterproof 120H Playtime\nBuilt-in Mic with Deep Bass for Sports Work  ](/Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones-\nCharging-Waterproof/dp/B07ZQCST89?ref_=fspcr_pl_dp_2_3379571011)\n\nBy vankyo\n\n3 offers from  product priceCA$55.50\n\n__ 4.7 | 2,547 customer ratings  \n96% of the ratings are 4-stars or 5-stars\n\n[ __Good choice! ](/gp/customer-\nreviews/R2OSS7JOWDNYWX?ref_=fspcr_pl_sr_1_5_2_3379571011)\n\nVery good headphones, exquisite workmanship, good sound quality, the most\nimportant thing is the price is right, the box can also be used as a charging\ntreasure, great, bought a headset, also get a charging treasure, very cost-\neffectiveVery good headphones, exquisite workmanship, good sound quality, the\nmost important thing is the price is right, the box can also be used as a\ncharging treasure, great, bought a headset, also get a charging treasure, very\ncost-effectiveVery good headphones, exquisite workmanship, good sound quality,\nthe most important thing is that the price is cheap,the box can also be used\nas a charging treasure, great, bought a headset, also get a charging treasure,\nvery cost-effective.\n\n[ Read more ](/gp/customer-\nreviews/R2OSS7JOWDNYWX?ref_=fspcr_pl_sr_1_5_2_3379571011)\n\nBy haoran\n\n[ __5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable, long battery life, good quality\n](/gp/customer-reviews/R2DMZ6V8PZDLPA?ref_=fspcr_pl_sr_2_5_2_3379571011)\n\nThey are very comfortable, easy to connect and sound great.

These MPOW are not audiophile-grade, but\nfor a workout or general listening, it has good characteristics with a bias\ntowards elevated bass and upper-mids. It sounds really good for current music\nfrom EDM, to Hip-Hop, and Pop.

The look and feel of these earbuds is top notch, the hard\nplastic charging case is small enough to fit in most pockets and feels nice in\nhand.
