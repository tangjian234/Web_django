It's an approach being taken in every\naspect of consumer tech, from computer setups to home theater systems.\nHeadphones are proving to be no different.\n\nMore and more companies are releasing headphones that don't require any\nauxiliary inputs to output audio. And since many smart devices are eliminating\nthe number of input ports they include (we're looking at your, iPhone), this\nmakes sense.\n\nSEE ALSO: [7 of the best on-ear headphones, according to online\nreviews](https://mashable.com/2018/05/31/best-on-ear-headphones-reviews/)\n\nBut with all the wireless headphones available on the market, it can be hard\nfiguring out which work best for you. Luckily, we've found some of the best\nearbuds and over-the-ear headphones on Amazon that deliver, regardless of your\nlifestyle.\n\nHere are 10 of the best wireless headphones, according to what reviewers on\nAmazon had to say:\n\n### Best earbud-style wireless headphones\n\nEarbuds are the headphones to look at if you're more active.

That quality is present in Bose headphones as\nwell, and the [Bose SoundSport\nWireless](https://zdcs.link/ao8AA?pageview=00CkKRmT4Xhyj1KaRUAg2Wr) earbuds\nare an example of the Bose quality in a small package.  \nThe SoundSport Wireless headphones are the type of headset that can work for\nanyone because of their design.
