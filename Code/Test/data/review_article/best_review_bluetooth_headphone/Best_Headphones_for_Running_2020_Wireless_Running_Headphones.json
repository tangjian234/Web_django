To\nhelp you make the right choice, our editors tested 40 pairs for at least two\nweeks of running and cross-training. These 17 models passed our tests, but two\nrose above: The [Jabra Elite Active\n75t](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082Y2KM92) is the best pair of truly\nwireless running earbuds, while the [Anker Soundcore Spirit\nSweatguard](https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Soundcore-Waterproof-SweatGuard-\nComfortable/dp/B07BHHB5RH) took the title for best budget earbuds. Learn more\nabout our top picks below, then keep scrolling for more information on what\nmakes an excellent set of wireless earbuds and reviews of the 15 great runners\nup.\n\n* * *\n\n#### The Best Running Earbuds\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082Y2KM92?linkCode=ogi)\n\nJabra\n\nElite Active 75t Earbuds\n\n$199.99\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082Y2KM92?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * IP57 full waterproof and sweatproof\n  * 7.5-hour battery life\n  * Excellent sound quality\n  * HearThrough mode allows you to adjust ambient sound\n\n###\n\n  * HearThrough ineffective in high wind\n\nJabra nailed the shape on the Elite Active 75t\u2014these truly wireless buds fit\ntest manager Dan Roe better than any others he\u2019s tried. Credit that to the\nangular build that nests snugly in the outer ear canal, without giving you\nthat tightly sealed, high-pressure \u201cthud\u201d with each foot strike. The sound\nquality is crisp, dynamic, and full, rivaling [Apple\u2019s AirPods\nPro](https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a29616378/apple-airpods-pro-first-run-\nreview/)\u2014but these Jabras will cost you less and offer about 90 more minutes\nof battery on a single charge. (However, the hear-through mode isn\u2019t quite as\nimpressive.) For dust and water protection, they\u2019re rated IP57, meaning they\nshould withstand a sandstorm or a monsoon; that\u2019s especially good news for\nRoe, who killed a pair of AirPods in six short months with his sweaty ears.\nCompeting earbuds from Apple, Bose, Jaybird, and others may offer even better\nsound or superior comfort or exceptional ambient awareness modes, but none do\nall of those things better than the 75t.\n\n* * *\n\n#### The Best Cheap Running Earbuds\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BHHB5RH?linkCode=ogi)\n\nAnker\n\nSoundcore Spirit SweatGuard Headphones\n\n$32.99\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BHHB5RH?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * IPX7 waterproof rating\n  * 8-hour battery life\n  * Still performing after 8 months of use\n\n###\n\n  * Minimal ambient sound\n\nAssistant digital editor Jessica Coulon has been using the Anker Spirit\nSweatGuard for the past eight months, and the $33 buds haven\u2019t ceased to\nimpress. The sound quality is better than you get from a cheap pair of wired\nSkullcandy headphones, Coulon says, although the SweatGuard could use a bit\nmore bass. The earbuds stay in place, thanks to four included ear tip sizes\nand two wing sizes, and the connecting cord wasn\u2019t distracting, save the\noccasional snag. The metrics are impressive, too: An IPX7 waterproof rating\nand eight-hour battery life rival earbuds at the $100 level. The quality and\nlack of ambient sound leave something to be desired but, for $33, there\u2019s a\nlot to like about this offering from Anker.  \n\n* * *\n\n### The Three Types of Buds\n\nFor the sake of making useful comparisons, we segmented our test pool into\nthree categories: truly wireless; truly wireless with a hook over the ear; and\nwire-connected, which means there\u2019s a wire or band joining the two earbuds to\neach other. We also added a fourth category of [cheap earbuds\u2014under\n$70](https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a28870759/cheap-wireless-headphones/).\nHere\u2019s what to expect from each type.\n\n#### Truly Wireless\n\nThese buds have neither connecting wires nor hooks that extend around your\near; you just push them in and go. Being compact makes them lightweight, and\ntheir small batteries means shorter runtimes, although all of our test models\ncame with charging cases that allow you to juice them up on the go. They also\ntend to be the most expensive. An example is the Jabra Elite Active 75t above.\n\n#### Truly Wireless with Ear Hooks\n\nAdding a hook can improve an earbud\u2019s fit, since there\u2019s a second point of\ncontact to hold it in place. The hook can also store antennae or a battery,\nhelping these buds play longer than their truly wireless counterparts. They\u2019re\ngenerally marginally cheaper than truly wireless models, but some cost more\nthan $200 anyway. Examples include the Beats Powerbeats Pro, JBL Endurance\nPeak, and Plantronics BackBeat Fit 3100.\n\n#### Wire-Connected Earbuds\n\nThese earbuds are still untethered from your phone, but they use a wire or\nband to connect the buds and store batteries, microphones, or an antenna. If\nyou can get past the connecting wire, you\u2019ll enjoy better battery life (eight\nor more hours, compared to four from truly wireless) and a significantly lower\nprice.\n\n### How We Tested\n\nTo keep the playing field level, we asked for the same feedback from all of\nour testers, thinking about which qualities were important to us as runners\nwho use these devices. Here\u2019s how we evaluated:\n\n#### Sound Quality\n\nOur staffers aren\u2019t audiophiles, so evaluating sound quality is largely\nsubjective. Still, we\u2019ve all used earbuds before, and we asked our testers to\ncompare to others they\u2019ve tried and provide specific feedback on the way their\ntest buds made their favorite songs and podcasts sound.  \n\n#### Fit and Ambient Sound\n\nHow an earbud fits affects how much outside sound it lets in, and there\u2019s no\nideal balance for everyone. Some runners like buds that fit deep in their ears\nand block all outside noise, allowing them to focus on the tunes, while others\nprefer lots of environmental sound from a looser fit. (The latter fit is safer\nfor running outside and among other people.) So although we didn\u2019t rank the\nearbuds by ambient sound, we did rank them based on whether they stayed in our\ntesters\u2019 ears.\n\nAnd because isolating you from the outside world should lend a clearer sound,\nwe expected better sound quality from earbuds that fit snug in the ear than we\ndid from earbuds that let in a lot of noise. For the best of both worlds, some\nof the pricier models offer an ambient sound mode, which uses the device\u2019s\nmicrophone to bring in outside noise while maintaining a tight fit.\n\n#### Connectivity\n\nWe also asked testers to evaluate how quickly and easily the buds connected to\ntheir phones, and how far they were able to get from their phones before the\nsignal cut out. And we recorded any mid-run connectivity issues.\n\n#### Quality\n\nIn two weeks of testing, we encountered few quality issues, but we also asked\nour testers to discuss how the earbuds felt\u2014you\u2019d expect a $200 set of buds to\nfeel premium compared to a $40 pair. For long-term quality assessment, we\nchecked user reviews from Amazon and other retailers looking for persistent\nissues, and we\u2019ll update our findings if any issues crop up as we continue to\nrun with these models.\n\n#### Water- and Sweat-Resistance\n\nNone of our testers had issues with water or sweat ruining their buds, but in\na longer test scenario, moisture can and will destroy earbuds that aren\u2019t\ncapable of repelling it. So we factored in each device\u2019s IP, or [_Ingress\nProtection_](https://www.mpl.ch/info/IPratings.html), rating. The rating\nconsists of two numbers. The first indicates dust protection, the second is\nfor water protection. \u201cX\u201d in place of either number means there\u2019s no data (so\nan \u201cIPX\u201d rating means dust protection wasn\u2019t evaluated). The second number,\nfor liquid ingress, is the one that matters most to runners.\n\nA score of one or two means an earbud can withstand dripping water; Scores of\nthree to six mean it will survive increasing amounts of rainfall for longer\nperiods of time. The gold standard is a score of seven to nine, meaning the\nearbud can be submerged in varying depths of water without failing. Most\nearbuds in this test have an IP rating, and most ratings were IPX4 or above.\n\n#### Battery Life\n\nWe checked manufacturer\u2019s claims against our testers\u2019 experience and noted\ndiscrepancies where they occurred.\n\nWe\u2019ll continually update this roundup with our test impressions of the latest\nwireless earbuds for runners, and tell us what you think about your buds in\nthe comments.\n\n* * *\n\n## Truly Wireless\n\n* * *\n\n### Jaybird Vista\n\n _These compact buds are more durable than ever_\n\n[\n](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1576258&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jaybirdsport.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fvista.html&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.runnersworld.com%2Fgear%2Fa20852590%2Fthe-\nbest-wireless-headphones-for-\nrunning%2F%3Fpre%3Dgear%252F%26prefix%3Da%26id%3D20852590%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fthe-\nbest-wireless-headphones-for-running)\n\nJaybird\n\nVista\n\n$179.99\n\n[SHOP\nNOW](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1576258&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jaybirdsport.com%2Fen-\nus%2Fvista.html&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.runnersworld.com%2Fgear%2Fa20852590%2Fthe-\nbest-wireless-headphones-for-\nrunning%2F%3Fpre%3Dgear%252F%26prefix%3Da%26id%3D20852590%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fthe-\nbest-wireless-headphones-for-running)\n\njaybirdsport.com\n\n###\n\n  * Waterproof \n  * 5-minute quick charge yields 60 mins of battery\n  * 6 hours of battery life\n\nJaybird\u2019s new set of buds has two extra hours of run time over the popular Run\nXT. The Vista lasts six hours on a single charge, long enough to get you to\nthe finish line of your next 26.2. Jaybird also beefed up the durability,\ncompletely sealing the buds from moisture and dust\u2014go ahead, try to kill these\nwith sweat; we haven\u2019t been able to. The brand also built its own Bluetooth\nchip, improving the connection with your phone. The buds stuttered a little in\nthe most challenging environments in NYC, but stayed interruption-free far\nmore regularly than the aforementioned Run XT. Bonus: They\u2019re smaller than all\nbut AirPods and have a pocketable case that stays closed in your gym bag.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Jabra Elite Active 65t\n\n_A small package with high-end sound that stays put_\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BHF993Q?linkCode=ogi)\n\nJabra\n\nElite Active 65t\n\n$138.88\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BHF993Q?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * Secure fit\n  * Balanced, dynamic sound\n\n###\n\n  * Hear-through mode is mostly wind noise\n\nThe Elite Active 65t is no longer Jabra\u2019s top sport earbud, but it\u2019s almost as\ngood as its successor and $60 cheaper. (The 75t has slightly better battery\nlife, fit, and sound, and a much better HearThrough mode.) Both of our testers\nfound a secure fit with the three included sizes of silicone inserts, and\nspecial projects editor Kit Fox\u2014a regular AirPods user\u2014said the Jabras had the\nbest sound quality of any wireless headphones he\u2019d tried. The earbuds also\npreviously [topped BestProducts.com\u2019s\nlist](https://www.bestproducts.com/tech/gadgets/a15385022/reviews-sports-\nheadphones-for-running-workouts/) of quality workout headphones. The bass\nisn\u2019t as impressive as offerings from Bose and Sennheiser, but the buds still\nthump when you\u2019ve established a tight seal and deliver a balanced sound across\nhip-hop, rock, folk (Fox\u2019s second favorite), and podcasts (his favorite). The\nlightweight buds didn\u2019t move once our runs began, and the hear-through mode\nbrings in ambient sound when necessary. However, the ambient sound quality\nstill isn\u2019t great when they\u2019re sealed properly in your ears. Roe said he went\ndown an insert size, losing some of the in-ear sound quality to gain ambient\nnoise for outdoor running. The five-hour battery life is enough for most runs,\nand the small charging case packs an additional 10 hours. Sound investment:\nJabra\u2019s warranty covers the earbuds for two years of dust and sweat damage.\n\n* * *\n\n### Bose Soundsport Free\n\n _Exceptional sound but inconsistent connectivity_\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748JM8M5?linkCode=ogi)\n\nBose\n\nSoundSport Free\n\n$249.00\n\n$199.00 (20% off)\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748JM8M5?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * Best-in-class sound\n\n###\n\n  * Bigger than other truly wireless buds, require more adjusting\n\nIf you\u2019re going to pay $200 for anything Bose, it should first sound very\ngood. The Soundsport Free delivers. \u201cThe sound quality is amazing,\u201d said video\nproducer Pat Heine. \u201cDeep bass and crisp high tones. I mean, it\u2019s Bose, not\njust a bass boost.\u201d At 60 percent of his device\u2019s highest volume setting, he\ncould still hear nearby cars, so there\u2019s a decent amount of ambient sound as\nlong as you\u2019re not blasting your tunes. However, the buds required continuous\nadjustment during runs, and the biggest gripe was connectivity. Heine said the\nearbuds would cut out when he moved his hand between his iPhone 6 and his\nears, even with his phone in a pocket on his chest. Runner-in-chief Jeff\nDengate had no problems, however, when using a pair with his iPhone XS.\n\n* * *\n\n## Truly Wireless with Hooks\n\n* * *\n\n### Beats Powerbeats Pro\n\n _Big battery, expansive sound, stays put\u2014near perfect_\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R5QD598?linkCode=ogi)\n\nBeats by Dr. Dre\n\nPowerbeats Pro\n\n$249.95\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R5QD598?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * 9-hour single-charge battery life\n  * Expansive sound\n  * Ear hooks ensure secure fit\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro is the complete package\u2014both well-rounded as wireless sport\nheadphones and literally a large box that contains the earbuds and an\nadditional 15 hours of juice. Not that you\u2019re likely to need it; the buds last\nfor nine hours on a single charge. \u201cThe sound you get from the Powerbeats Pro\nis really expansive,\u201d said Dengate in his [_full\nreview_](https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a27456161/beats-powerbeats-pro-\nreview/). \u201cEvery song sounds like you\u2019re listening in a larger room, with\nspeakers positioned away from you.\u201d Ambient noise starts out minimal but\nincreases as sweat causes the earbuds to lose some of their seal. The music\ngets a little hollower, but the awareness means you\u2019ll pick up loud\nenvironmental noises like sirens and horns. Bluetooth pairing is immediate\nwith an iPhone, and a five-minute quick charge delivers 90 worth of playback.\nThe Powerbeats are rated IPX4 so they\u2019ll withstand a rainstorm (but not\nsubmersion), and despite their large size, the buds keep a low enough profile\nto be comfortable with a hat and sunglasses.\n\n* * *\n\n### JBL Endurance Peak\n\n _Comfortable with quality sound, but don\u2019t expect to hear much else_\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GVQR3JJ?linkCode=ogi)\n\nJBL\n\nEndurance Peak\n\n$119.95\n\n$99.95 (17% off)\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GVQR3JJ?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * IPX7 waterproof rating\n  * Smart ear hooks switch buds off when not in use\n\n###\n\n  * Minimal ambient sound\n\nAfter six runs and some in-office use, one tester said she\u2019d buy JBL\u2019s\nEndurance Peak with her own money. Music sounded clear and balanced. Using the\nsmallest ear tips, the buds stayed in her ears and the hooks didn\u2019t ruin the\nfit of her sunglasses, staying comfortable after hours of wear. On anything\nbut low volume, ambient sound was minimal. And despite being larger than many\nsimilar headphones and bearing the \u201cEndurance\u201d moniker, they delivered just\nfour hours of battery life.\n\n* * *\n\n### Plantronics BackBeat Fit 3100\n\n _A safe balance of ambient noise and great sound_\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FTYGFR2?linkCode=ogi)\n\nPlantronics\n\nBackBeat Fit 3100\n\n$149.99\n\n$74.49 (50% off)\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FTYGFR2?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * Enough ambient sound for urban running\n  * Secure fit\n\n###\n\n  * Bluetooth interference\n  * Doesn\u2019t play nice with sunglasses\n\nFeatures director Matt Allyn used the Plantronics BackBeat Fit 3100 in midtown\nManhattan traffic and on a serene Pennsylvania rail trail, finding their sound\nand awareness worked well in both areas. \u201cOn the rail trail, I could still\nmake out the sounds of bird flapping nearby,\u201d he said. He also felt aware\nenough to Citibike around New York City wearing them, although they struggled\nwith interference from other devices (most wireless models we\u2019ve tested have\nthis problem). The buds hover over the ear canal, rather than fitting within\nit, and use the hooks to stay in place\u2014they didn\u2019t require adjustment once\nrunning. However, the hooks do make them less comfortable to wear with\nsunglasses.\n\n* * *\n\n## Wire-Connected\n\n* * *\n\n### Plantronics BackBeat Fit 2100\n\n_Lightweight, with lots of ambient sound_\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FTTPVGG?linkCode=ogi)\n\nPlantronics\n\nBackBeat Fit 2100\n\n$99.99\n\n$69.90 (30% off)\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FTTPVGG?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * Lightweight, comfortable\n  * Plenty of ambient sound\n\n###\n\n  * Lackluster sound quality\n\nThe BackBeat Fit 2100 has been around for a while, so the originally $100 pair\nof earbuds can now be had for $50 to $70 on Amazon. At 26 grams, they\u2019re\nultra-light, and the rubberized connecting wire is rigid, eliminating bouncing\nagainst your neck. The ear tips sit just outside your ear canal\u2014that pumps up\nambient sound and lets you hear traffic but prevents the sound quality from\nbeing as good as it could be. We haven\u2019t had any issues with our test pair,\nalthough a worrisome number of Amazon reviews chronicle a hissing noise that\ndevelops after a couple of months.\n\n* * *\n\n### Aftershokz Trekz Air\n\n _The ultimate headphones for urban running awareness_\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G3HTB1X?linkCode=ogi)\n\nAftershokz\n\nTrekz Air\n\n$119.95\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G3HTB1X?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * Most ambient sound of any workout headphones\n  * Comfortable, works well with sunglasses\n\n###\n\n  * Thinner, quieter sound than in-ear buds\n\nFor road runners who aren\u2019t comfortable jamming an earbud in as cars whiz\npast, there\u2019s the Trekz Air. These headphones use bone conduction technology\nto transfer sound through your cheekbones, leaving your ears open to hear\npotential hazards before they sneak up on you. Compared to in-ear designs from\nJaybird and Bose, the sound is \u201cadmittedly thinner and quieter, but I find it\ntotally suitable for the occasion,\u201d said Dengate in his [_full\nreview_](https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a23843797/aftershokz-trekz-air-\nheadphones-review/). The headband is lighter and slimmer than the previous\nmodel, which allows you to wear sunglasses with the headphones.

And there\u2019s a lot more to like than the\nreasonable price: The buds form a tight seal in your ears and don\u2019t move after\nyou\u2019ve started to trot. The downside for outdoor runners is the lack of\nambient sound, which also isolates your tunes from the outside world. Image\neditor Jimmy Cavalieri also used them while mowing his lawn. \u201cAlthough I could\nstill hear my lawnmower, the earbuds blocked out enough engine noise that the\nquality of the audio still sounded good without having to max out the volume,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cThe sound quality was clear enough that if you concentrate and\nreally listen to the music, you can identify each instrument.\u201d The connecting\nwire between the buds is lightweight and hardly noticeable mid-run, and the\nReflect Mini 2 connected via Bluetooth fast and stayed connected up to 100\nfeet away. The earbuds also sport reflective cables for nighttime visibility,\nan IPX5 water-resistant rating, and an impressive 10 hours of battery life.\n\n* * *\n\n### Bose SoundSport\n\n _A comfortable, in-ear fit with excellent sound_\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZI7KQB?linkCode=ogi)\n\nBose\n\nSoundSport\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZI7KQB?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * Excellent sound quality\n  * Secure, comfortable fit\n\n###\n\n  * Little ambient sound\n\nThe Bose SoundSport Wireless are among the best in this test because of their\nsuperior fit and impressive sound quality. Test editor Bobby Lea quickly\ndialed in the comfort so the buds didn\u2019t pop out mid-workout, despite the big\nspeaker housing. And the sound quality was as crisp and dynamic as you\u2019d\nexpect from Bose. The earbuds quickly connected to Lea\u2019s iPhone 7 and stayed\ntethered more than 100 feet away from it. Alas, the buds don\u2019t let in much\nambient sound. \u201cThey make you largely oblivious to the world around you, even\nat half volume,\u201d Lea said. The SoundSport will give you a quality audio\nexperience, just don\u2019t let it ruin your awareness.\n\n* * *\n\n### Jaybird Tarah Pro\n\n _The ultrarunner\u2019s choice for all-day audio_\n\n[\n](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1576258&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jaybirdsport.com%2Fen-\nus%2Ftarah-\npro.html%23985-000822&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.runnersworld.com%2Fgear%2Fa20852590%2Fthe-\nbest-wireless-headphones-for-\nrunning%2F%3Fpre%3Dgear%252F%26prefix%3Da%26id%3D20852590%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fthe-\nbest-wireless-headphones-for-running)\n\nJaybird\n\nTarah Pro\n\n$129.99\n\n[SHOP\nNOW](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1576258&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jaybirdsport.com%2Fen-\nus%2Ftarah-\npro.html%23985-000822&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.runnersworld.com%2Fgear%2Fa20852590%2Fthe-\nbest-wireless-headphones-for-\nrunning%2F%3Fpre%3Dgear%252F%26prefix%3Da%26id%3D20852590%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fthe-\nbest-wireless-headphones-for-running)\n\njaybirdsport.com\n\n###\n\n  * 14-hour battery life\n  * Crisp, balanced sound\n\n###\n\n  * Minimal ambient sound\n\nThe Tarah Pro\u2019s biggest selling point is its claimed 14-hour battery life. We\ngot 12 to 14 during testing, but there\u2019s more to like about these ultra-\noptimized earbuds. Our music sounded clear and crisp, with an even balance of\nbass and treble. After gear & news editor Drew Dawson mixed and matched insert\nsizes, he found a fit that didn\u2019t irritate his ear canal. Ambient noise was\nminimal because of the in-ear fit\u2014you might hear a diesel truck, but a Prius\ncould sneak up on you if you\u2019re not aware. He appreciated small, overlooked\ndetails like the cinch that keeps excess cord from bouncing around and the\nmagnetic earbud backs, which snap the buds together when they\u2019re around your\nneck so you don\u2019t lose them on the trail.\n\n* * *\n\n## Cheap Earbuds\n\n* * *\n\n### Mobvoi TicPods\n\n _Lots of ambient sound for outdoor use_\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H8B9GTX?linkCode=ogi)\n\nMobvoi\n\nTicPods\n\n$129.99\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H8B9GTX?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * Lots of ambient sound\n\n###\n\n  * Lack bass\n\nThese AirPod lookalikes function similarly to the pricey Apple earbuds\u2014they\u2019re\nnot bass-heavy, nor do they block most outside noise. \u201cI listened to a podcast\nand it sounded just like they were talking next to me,\u201d said associate\nfeatures editor Taylor Rojek after riding her bike with them in. \u201cAnd music\nwas not super bass-heavy.\u201d On initial impressions, the TicPods don\u2019t feel\ncheap. We had no connectivity issues, and the four-hour battery life and an\nIPX5 waterproof rating make them worth considering if you\u2019re after truly\nwireless buds for a low price.\n\n* * *\n\n### TCL SOCL500TWS\n\n _Lightweight and comfortable_\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082LQCQLB?linkCode=ogi)\n\nTCL\n\nSOCL500TWS\n\n$69.99\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082LQCQLB?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * Light, comfortable fit\n\n###\n\n  * Light on bass\n  * Poor connectivity \n\nThese TCL earbuds are a little pricier than we\u2019d normally consider \u201ccheap,\u201d\nbut at $70, they\u2019re significantly more affordable than the leading truly\nwireless models. The buds are lightweight and stayed in our tester\u2019s ears\nafter he swapped tip sizes (there are three), requiring minimal adjustment on\nthe run. The sound is balanced but light on bass, though you turn up the low\nend and get pumping beats using your phone\u2019s EQ. The main issue is\nconnectivity: The Bluetooth signal cuts out when you put something between the\nright (master) earbud and your phone. The interruption didn\u2019t happen while\nrunning but while straying a few unobstructed feet from the phone\u2014even turning\nyour head, such that your dome is between the earbud and the phone, is enough\nto interrupt the signal. So the TCL SOCL is a decent mid-range options for\npeople who only use the buds while running, but not so great for people who\nset their phone down and continue to listen while exercising or hanging around\nthe house.\n\n* * *\n\n### Aukey EP-B60\n\n _Sacrifices some sound for a secure fit_\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N19TD5V?linkCode=ogi)\n\nAukey\n\nEP-B60 Headphones\n\n$39.99\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N19TD5V?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * IPX6 water resistance\n  * Stayed in place while running\n\n###\n\n  * Hollow sound\n\nThese headphones feature a convenient trick: Separating the magnetic buds\nactivates them and connects them to your phone, and snapping them back\ntogether turns them off. The wing-shaped tips provide a steady fit; we didn\u2019t\nhave to adjust them whatsoever mid-run. The EP-B60 is IPX6 water-\nresistant\u2014enough to withstand typical running conditions\u2014and the buds are\nlight enough to stay comfortable on a long run. (The bouncing wire and control\npanel eventually fade into the background, although they might annoy some\nrunners.) This is all good news for a $40 set of earbuds, but with sound\nquality, you get what you pay for: Music playback is tinny and hollow, so\naudiophiles best look elsewhere.\n\n* * *\n\n### Skullcandy Ink\u2019d Wireless\n\n _Get these handy budget buds while you still can_\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XPK9N8L?linkCode=ogi)\n\nSkullcandy\n\nInk\u2019d Headphones\n\n$48.99\n\n[SHOP NOW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XPK9N8L?linkCode=ogi)\n\namazon.com\n\n###\n\n  * 8-hour battery life\n  * Deep bass, in-ear fit yields full sound\n\n###\n\n  * Minimal ambient sound\n\nThe Ink\u2019d Wireless has recently been replaced by the Ink\u2019d+, which introduces\nrapid charging and active voice assistant functions. We\u2019ve yet to try the\nshiny new version, but after seven months of testing its predecessor, Roe\nfound the original worth a recommendation (especially considering the sale\nprice on Amazon). The eight-hour battery means they don\u2019t require charging\nafter every other run, and they\u2019ve stood up to all the times he\u2019s pulled them\nby the earbud from the depths of his gym bag. The sound and fit are decent,\nfeaturing Skullcandy\u2019s characteristic, noise-blocking, in-ear fit and deep (if\nslightly muddy) bass. The tips at the ends of the band tend to bounce around\non your collarbones if you don\u2019t tuck them beneath your shirt collar, so the\nband will eventually fall off your neck if you\u2019re not wearing a shirt\u2014Roe used\na string to tie the ends of the band together, fashioning a necklace that\nstayed in place while running. For that, they\u2019re not perfect, but they\u2019ve\nstill shown us great quality and value.\n\nThis commenting section is created and maintained by a third party, and\nimported onto this page.
