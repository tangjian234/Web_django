He has nothing left to prove to anyone. But Beats, the brand that\ntranscended its origins as a cynical celebrity cash-in and became a cultural\nicon, has everything to prove. For a long time, Apple had seemingly frozen\ndevelopment of new products inside Beats, allowing its adopted brand to\nrelease only minor updates and alternative colorways. You could be forgiven\nfor thinking Beats was a neglected stepchild.\n\nThe new Powerbeats Pro put any such worries to rest. They are the most\nsincerely and comprehensively new Beats product since the Apple takeover, and\nthey are a triumph. The Doctor\u2019s headphone elves have been quietly busy, and\nthe first true wireless Beats earphones happen to also be the best Beats\nheadphones of any size or kind. At $250, they don\u2019t come cheap. However, the\nPowerbeats Pro deliver numerous advantages over Apple\u2019s cheaper and simpler\nAirPods, and those upgrades totally validate the Beats price premium.\n\n##  Our review of  [Beats Powerbeats Pro](/products/powerbeats-pro/9084)\n\nVerge Score 8.5 out of 10\n\n![](https://cdn0.vox-\ncdn.com/hermano/verge/product/image/9084/cwelch_190402_3343_1618__3_.jpg)\n\n### Good Stuff\n\n  * Superbly comfortable and steady in the ear, even during intense workouts\n  * Huge soundstage for true wireless earphones\n  * Rich sound with satisfying bass thump\n  * Sweat and water resistance\n  * Epic battery life for the category\n\n### Bad Stuff\n\n  * Laughably large carrying case\n  * The treble energy can be fatiguing with long listening sessions\n  * Wireless or USB-C charging would have been nice\n  * Not the most discreet look for office or casual environments\n\n[Buy for $199.95 from\nWalmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPowerbeats-\nPro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones-\nBlack%2F128591554%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_Sx12u60BpxyOUpTwUx0Mo38VUkiUW-\nwZwQFYU40%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DSx12u60BpxyOUpTwUx0Mo38VUkiUW-\nwZwQFYU40%26sharedid%3D&sharedid=verge) [Buy for $249.95 from Best\nBuy](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbeats-\nby-dr-dre-powerbeats-pro-totally-wireless-earphones-\nblack%2F6341988.p%3FskuId%3D6341988&sharedid=verge) [Buy for $249.95 from\nApple](https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMV702LL%2FA%2Fpowerbeats-\npro-totally-wireless-earphones-\nnavy&referrer=theverge.com&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2019%2F5%2F10%2F18563329%2Fapple-\npowerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price)\n\nUpon unboxing the Powerbeats Pro, you\u2019ll have to stifle a laugh at the size of\ntheir carrying case. It\u2019s like a regular true-wireless headphones case with a\nserious case of gigantism. You could probably fit _four_ AirPods cases in the\nvolume occupied by the Powerbeats Pro\u2019s indulgently chunky box. Looking on the\nbright side, it\u2019s a very robust case, it includes a battery to more than\ndouble the earphones\u2019 running time, and it\u2019s still less than half the size of\na case for over-ear headphones. And without wishing to get ahead of myself,\nthe sound quality of the Powerbeats Pro is good enough for them to indeed be\ncompared to over-ear portable alternatives.\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/SezCFf_JrG9OiboK2mDsfTf-l1g=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2040x1360\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234645/apple_powerbeats_pro_vladsavov19051005.jpg)\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RNgjSynG9hxf2auOl-\niwCbkycJQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2040x1360\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234644/apple_powerbeats_pro_vladsavov19051003.jpg)\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/j_liLADnMW-5RpHM06530_jovhM=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2040x1360\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234646/apple_powerbeats_pro_vladsavov19051006.jpg)\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/dMpEAZTTFexyamNWcA5wDazxv9s=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2040x1360\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234650/apple_powerbeats_pro_vladsavov19051007.jpg)\n\nThe design of this new generation of Powerbeats is subtly brilliant. It still\nhas the crossbar section that houses the batteries for each bud, but now it\u2019s\nmuch more gracefully integrated into the hard stem that curves up to go over\nand around the back of the ear. Apple also gradually softened the part that\nwraps around your ear to make it more comfortable and forgiving to what\u2019s a\nhighly sensitive area of the body. (There\u2019s no fat to protect the cartilage of\nyour ear.) That single, flowing external shape makes the Powerbeats Pro look\nvastly more coherent and intentionally designed than their chunky predecessor.\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sMKEVGwcUFs4jOX-\nepE16Q09iWE=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2040x1360\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234654/apple_powerbeats_pro_vladsavov19051012.jpg)\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/wubDmjVNvFCvHNE7LpMRAEVrJAg=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2040x1360\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234653/apple_powerbeats_pro_vladsavov19051013.jpg)\n\nIt\u2019s still not the most discreet look \u2014 for which I\u2019d probably recommend\nSamsung\u2019s almost-invisible [Galaxy\nBuds](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255221/samsung-galaxy-buds-\nheadphones-truly-wireless-review-price-specs-features) \u2014 but it allows you to\nfeel more comfortable wearing a pair of Powerbeats earphones outside the\ncontext of a gym or an exercise session.\n\nSeating the earbuds into my ears was a bit of a fiddly task at first. They\ndon\u2019t have the AirPods\u2019 streamlined, mindlessly simple shape, and so I have to\npay a bit of attention getting them on and off. The advantageous difference\nfrom the AirPods, though, is that the Powerbeats Pro have various sizes of in-\near tips, so they have a far more customizable fit. That should mean they have\na better chance of matching the people who find the AirPods fall out or don\u2019t\nfit correctly.\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/5us_PAM0b6feI2_hhbElosxi7cM=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2040x1360\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234651/apple_powerbeats_pro_vladsavov19051009.jpg)\n\nWith the new Powerbeats, I do find that if I don\u2019t position them well, the\nright over-ear hook starts to dig into the back of my ear. (You can blame my\nphysical asymmetry for why it only happens on one side.) I also worried about\nthose hooks clashing with the arms of glasses, but my colleague Chris Welch,\nwho tried the Powerbeats Pro [at their\nannouncement](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/3/18292853/beats-powerbeats-pro-\ntrue-wireless-earbuds-announced-airpods), says the trick is to put the\nearphones on before your glasses and everything is fine. Once you get past\nthose minor stumbles, what you\u2019ll get from the Powerbeats Pro is absolutely\nphenomenal fit, stability, and comfort.\n\nFor their size and shape, these are super light earphones. I wouldn\u2019t quite\nsay you can forget you\u2019re wearing them, mostly owing to the over-ear hooks\nrather than the buds themselves, but these aren\u2019t too far away from the\nfeathery ease of wear of the AirPods.\n\n\"These solve many of the ergonomic problems of neckbuds and the AirPods\"\n\nMy colleague Thomas Ricker has two specific complaints about Apple\u2019s other\nwireless earphones: he hates the way the connecting cord of the earlier\nPowerbeats would flap against the back of his neck while running, and when\nswitching to the AirPods, he finds his hoodie catches their protruding stems\nwhen he turns his head. The Powerbeats Pro solve both of those issues. Their\nnicely curved exterior design means they have no aberrant shapes sticking out\nto catch on things. I very much approve these headphones for use with hoodies,\nand I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the savvy Beats engineers made a point of\nperfecting that jogger-friendly combination.\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/NWkzlAMGnwkzq0Y1OtVR7I44qQA=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2040x1360\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234649/apple_powerbeats_pro_vladsavov19051011.jpg)\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro are, at their heart, exercise headphones, and I put them\nthrough their paces. I ran, played basketball, jumped around like a 20-year-\nold at a metal concert, I lifted weights, I grimaced, I even broke a sweat\nwith the Pros on. But they didn\u2019t. I\u2019m shocked by just how stable these\nearphones remain in my ears no matter what I throw at them. (Side note: the\nbattery case isn\u2019t water-resistant like the buds, so you should definitely dry\nthe sweat off the buds before tossing them back in there.)\n\nRelated\n\n#### [Beats Solo Pro review: beat the\nnoise](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931329/beats-solo-pro-review-\nnoise-canceling-on-ear-wireless-headphones-features-price)\n\nCognizant of the incompatibility between touch controls and sweaty hands,\nApple has wisely stuck to mechanical controls on the Powerbeats Pro. There\u2019s a\nsymmetrical arrangement on each bud: The circular \u201cb\u201d logo is the control for\nmusic playback and answering or rejecting calls, and there\u2019s a small volume\nrocker above that. With the new Apple H1 chip on board, you also get the\noption to have Siri always listening for your voice commands. You can [read\nmore about the H1 chip upgrade in our AirPods 2\nreview](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-\ngen-review-price-specs-features) from a few weeks ago.\n\n\"They may be an Apple product, but the Powerbeats Pro also work beautifully\nwith Android devices\"\n\nBeing a devoted Android user, I have primarily been using the Powerbeats Pro\npaired to a Google Pixel 3 XL. Guess what? They work brilliantly together.\nKeeping up the excellent wireless performance of the AirPods, Apple\u2019s\nPowerbeats Pro provide a faultlessly stable connection \u2014 I\u2019ve had exactly zero\ndropouts or signal disturbances \u2014 and they have the longest connection range\nof any true wireless headphones I\u2019ve yet tested. Given the Pixel\u2019s reputation\nfor having somewhat questionable Bluetooth performance, I can say you\u2019d\nstruggle to find a device that won\u2019t work beautifully with the Powerbeats Pro.\nNot that that should be a surprise when Apple\u2019s already on the second\ngeneration of its true wireless AirPods champ.\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/NrH4yEXPAqMa4NMTs8YXhXNua3o=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2040x1360\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234642/apple_powerbeats_pro_vladsavov19051002.jpg)\n\nWatching YouTube videos on Android with the Powerbeats Pro, I notice no\ndetectable lag. The automatic sensors that pause and resume music depending on\nwhether you have the earphones in also work as well on Android as they do on\niOS. Same goes for taking calls with these earbuds: no latency, no garbling or\nfailure to communicate. In fact, the Powerbeats Pro are so good at things that\nhave nothing to do with workouts that I\u2019m tempted to recommend them as a\nuniversal pair of do-everything earbuds.\n\n\"Setting a new standard for true wireless battery life\"\n\nTheir claimed nine-hour battery life off one charge is so good that I\u2019ve never\nbeen able to come close to draining them. Even at my most intensive and\nextended listening, I don\u2019t go beyond five hours at a time, and then when I\nreturn to the earphones, they\u2019ve refueled inside their chunky case and are\nready to go even longer. Apple claims a total of 24 hours of power between the\ncase and the earphones. It\u2019s almost enough to make me forgive the company for\nforcing me to carry a Lightning cable around specifically for the Powerbeats\nPro. Wireless or USB-C charging really would have been helpful.\n\nBut there are two things that prevent me from crowning the Powerbeats Pro as\nthe uncontested best true wireless earbuds.\n\nOne is that they don\u2019t quite have the noise isolation to be great commuter\nheadphones. Don\u2019t misunderstand: these have a vastly better seal and isolation\nthan the AirPods and are a real upgrade from Apple on that front. But when I\u2019m\nwearing them on the London Tube, subtler music like Burial\u2019s _Burial_ gets\noverwhelmed by the drone of the train\u2019s passage through the tunnel. Jabra\u2019s\nElite 65t are far superior in these circumstances, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds also\nhold their own, and if you\u2019re willing to tolerate a connecting wire, neckbuds\nlike the OnePlus Bullets Wireless do an even better job.\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/8vk5B8Twn5_ho1QRSBKrWuOAv0U=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2040x1360\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234652/apple_powerbeats_pro_vladsavov19051008.jpg)\n\nThe other small foible, and it\u2019s a highly unusual one for Beats headphones, is\nthat the Powerbeats Pro have a lot of treble energy in their tuning. This is a\ncomplicated issue to address because that treble is what gives them my\nfavorite sound of any Beats headphones to date, but it can also be fatiguing\nif you\u2019re just listening to the Powerbeats Pro in a quiet place and trying to\nrelax. These are not laid-back headphones _at all_ , and you have to know and\nbe comfortable with that right from the beginning.\n\n\"The Powerbeats Pro combine energetic highs with a tight and impactful bass\nthat\u2019s full of authority\"\n\nWhy do I enjoy the Powerbeats Pro sound? Well, it\u2019s everything that a sports\nor workout pair of headphones is supposed to give you. To be stimulating,\nworkout music has to be aggressive and in your face, not veiled or demure. The\nPowerbeats Pro combine energetic highs with a tight and impactful bass that is\nfull of authority. Music feels dynamic, fast, and, indeed, aggressive through\nthese headphones. Any Apple enthusiasts feeling bass-deprived by the AirPods\nwill find themselves very much at home with the Powerbeats Pro.\n\nThe signature Beats bass emphasis is much more refined on the Powerbeats Pro,\nand it serves only to provide a nice sweetener to vocals and instruments. Male\nvoices sound a little deeper and a little richer than they naturally are,\nwhich makes them \u2014 and the Pros\u2019 overall sound signature \u2014 more pleasant to\nlisten to. If it wasn\u2019t for that extra bit of treble sharpness, I seriously\nwould be recommending these as your go-to headphones for all situations. But I\nhave to also underline the fact that these wouldn\u2019t be as good in their\nprimary use case as sports headphones without those imposing highs.\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/j_g330i92nDnxMgFQwLkk0EvPVc=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2040x1360\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234643/apple_powerbeats_pro_vladsavov19051001.jpg)\n\nSampha\u2019s _Process_ serves up a good illustration of the Powerbeats Pro\u2019s\ndeftness in handling more nuanced and gentler productions. That album also\nshows off the surprisingly wide soundstage of these earphones. Rodrigo y\nGabriela\u2019s _Area 52_ , on the other hand, challenges the Pros with a diverse\ncavalcade of instruments, including an entire orchestra at times, all\ninterwoven and layered into a fast-paced, complex performance. Like a sports\nstar who happens to also be good at academics, the Powerbeats Pro do a\nremarkably cogent job of playing back all genres of music.\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro are the best Beats product yet. They raise the bar for what\ncan be expected of fitness and true wireless earphones, both in terms of sound\nquality and battery endurance. They improve on Apple\u2019s own AirPods in tangible\nways, and they shame rivals like Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless that\ncan\u2019t seem to be able to figure out the whole wireless connectivity issue.\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/1wVDuo8WTlUAoms26mQqGLAypKE=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2040x1360\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234647/apple_powerbeats_pro_vladsavov19051004.jpg)\n\nYou can go on Amazon or AliExpress today and find true wireless earbuds for\nless than $30, so the $250 asking price of the Powerbeats Pro is a\nconsiderable spend. But none of those budget alternatives will come close to\nthe design refinement, wireless performance, sound quality, or fit and\nstability of the Powerbeats Pro. Or that nine-hour battery life. Apple took a\nlong time to spit out a truly new Beats product, but now that it has, the wait\nhas absolutely been worth it.\n\n_Photography by Vlad Savov / The Verge_\n\n_Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.
