At most, Bluetooth earbuds might have a\nwire that connects the buds themselves to each other\u2014a nice option if you\u2019re\nprone to misplacing small objects, or you want in-line controls. This is often\nthe more affordable option too, although that is changing over time.\n\nSo-called true wireless earbuds are just that, free of any wire whatsoever.\nApple AirPods are the standard bearer of this category, but there are plenty\nof alternatives\u2014some more worthy than others.\n\nThat\u2019s just one decision you have to make. Wireless earbuds also vary on\nprice, sometimes greatly, and some might be better for audiophiles while\nothers are better for sports.

You buy them because they sound good, are super easy to\nconnect to all your Apple gear, are incredibly compact, work hands-free with\nSiri, and are incredibly comfortable.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to find wireless earbuds that do one or two things better than\nthe AirPods Pro, but for users of Apple products, it\u2019s really hard to find\nearbuds that do so many things so right.The AirPods Pro live at the sweet spot\nof comfort, ease of use, features, and sound quality.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n  * Excellent fit and comfort\n  * Compact wireless charging case\n  * Good active noise cancellation\n\n**Cons:**\n\n  * Sound quality is a little bland for the price\n  * Battery life is just okay\n\n### [Monoprice True Wireless Earbuds (model\n30878)](https://www.macworld.com/article/3445401/monoprice-true-wireless-\nearbuds-review-model-30878.html)\n\n[](https://www.macworld.com/article/3445401/monoprice-true-wireless-earbuds-\nreview-model-30878.html)\n\n###### Budget option + true wireless\n\n[](https://www.macworld.com/article/3445401/monoprice-true-wireless-earbuds-\nreview-model-30878.html)\n\n[Read Macworld's review](https://www.macworld.com/article/3445401/monoprice-\ntrue-wireless-earbuds-review-model-30878.html)\n\nMSRP $49.99\n\nSee it\n\n[on ]()\n\nNone of the really inexpensive wireless earbuds are without their foibles, but\nat only $50, the [Monoprice True Wireless Earbuds (model\n30878)](https://www.macworld.com/article/3445401/monoprice-true-wireless-\nearbuds-review-model-30878.html) really punch above their weight. Their sound\nquality is far superior to most others around the same price, and they provide\nexcellent comfort and fit.\n\nBattery life isn\u2019t as long as some more expensive options, and the microphone\nis just serviceable, nothing more. But the earbuds themselves sound great,\nmaintain their connection well, and do a great job of automatically\nreconnecting as soon as you pop them out of the case (a lot of cheap earbuds\ndon\u2019t).\n\n**Pros:**\n\n  * Cheap price\n  * Strong sound\n  * Solid Bluetooth connectivity\n\n**Cons:**\n\n  * Shoddy on-board mic\n  * 4-hour battery life\n  * Slow recharging\n\n### [Powerbeats Pro](https://www.macworld.com/article/3393466/powerbeats-pro-\nreview-better-than-airpods-but-not-for-everybody.html)\n\n[](https://www.macworld.com/article/3393466/powerbeats-pro-review-better-than-\nairpods-but-not-for-everybody.html)\n\n###### Good for working out + true wireless\n\n[](https://www.macworld.com/article/3393466/powerbeats-pro-review-better-than-\nairpods-but-not-for-everybody.html)\n\n[Read Macworld's review](https://www.macworld.com/article/3393466/powerbeats-\npro-review-better-than-airpods-but-not-for-everybody.html)\n\nMSRP $249.99\n\nSee it\n\n[on ]()\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro are Beats\u2019 first true wireless earbuds, and they\u2019re just\nthe thing for people looking for the AirPod experience, tailored for an active\nlifestyle. They use the new H1 chip found in the second-generation AirPods, so\nyou get the same pairing and syncing experience as with AirPods, and hands-\nfree \u201cHey, Siri\u201d capabilities.\n\nBeyond that, they resemble Beats more than AirPods. The design is similar to\nPowerbeats 3, only slightly smaller and lighter, angled for a better fit and\nbetter look, and of course without the cord between them.\n\nSound quality is quite good\u2014better than AirPods, thanks to the rubberized tips\nthat fit snug in your ears. In particular, you get much better bass response\nthan with AirPods, though these aren\u2019t as bass-overheavy as some Beats brand\ngear. They\u2019re splash and sweat proof, and stay put in your ears through all\nsorts of rigorous physical activity.\n\nBattery life is exceptional, too. The earbuds last for up to nine hours\nplaying music, or six hours of phone calls.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n  * Good sound quality \n  * Comfortable fit\n  * Epic battery life\n\n**Cons:**\n\n  * Pricey\n  * Case is too big for a pocket\n\n### [Master & Dynamic MW07](https://www.macworld.com/article/3310196/master-\ndynamic-mw07-true-wireless-headphones-review.html)\n\n[](https://www.macworld.com/article/3310196/master-dynamic-mw07-true-wireless-\nheadphones-review.html)\n\n###### Audiophile option + true wireless\n\n[](https://www.macworld.com/article/3310196/master-dynamic-mw07-true-wireless-\nheadphones-review.html)\n\n[Read Macworld's review](https://www.macworld.com/article/3310196/master-\ndynamic-mw07-true-wireless-headphones-review.html)\n\nMSRP $299.00\n\nSee it\n\n[on ]()\n\nWith 3.5 hours of battery life, per charge, the [Master & Dynamic\nMW07](https://www.macworld.com/article/3310196/consumer-electronics/master-\ndynamic-mw07-true-wireless-headphones-review.html) aren\u2019t the longest lasting\ntruly wireless earphones that we\u2019ve tested. But that didn\u2019t keep us from\nselecting it as our favorite pair of truly wireless earbuds for audiophiles.\nSimply stated, they\u2019re the best-sounding pair that we\u2019ve ever tested.\n\nOffering excellent aural separation and a surprisingly wide sound stage, the\nMW07 will fill your ears with rich, punchy bass, clear mids, and crisp high-\nfrequency audio. Everything we listened to on them sounded great. Master &\nDynamic includes five different sizes of silicon ear tips with the MW07, so\nfinding a good seal and comfortable fit should be achievable for most people.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n  * Outstanding sound quality\n  * Bespoke materials and excellent point quality\n  * USB-C charging\n\n**Cons:**\n\n  * Underwhelming battery life\n  * Battery case is a scratch and fingerprint magnet\n  * Expensive\n\n### [JayBird X4 Sport Wireless\nEarphones](https://www.macworld.com/article/3324041/jaybird-x4-wireless-\nsports-earphones-review.html)\n\n[](https://www.macworld.com/article/3324041/jaybird-x4-wireless-sports-\nearphones-review.html)\n\n###### Good for working out\n\n[](https://www.macworld.com/article/3324041/jaybird-x4-wireless-sports-\nearphones-review.html)\n\n[Read Macworld's\nreview](https://www.macworld.com/article/3324041/jaybird-x4-wireless-sports-\nearphones-review.html)\n\n[$129.48](http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14156&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07GVCZPSJ%2Fref%3Dtwister_B07GZBMZP8%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3DUS-002-3241464-003-1442082-web-20)MSRP\n$130.00\n\n[See\nit](http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14156&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07GVCZPSJ%2Fref%3Dtwister_B07GZBMZP8%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3DUS-002-3241464-003-1442082-web-20)\n\n[on\nAmazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GVCZPSJ/ref=twister_B07GZBMZP8?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)\n\nJaybird\u2019s X4 wireless sports earphones are reasonably priced, sound great, and\nboast enough features that most people will find a lot to like about them.\n([Read our full review\nhere](https://www.macworld.com/article/3324041/jaybird-x4-wireless-sports-\nearphones-review).) With their IPX7 rating, they can be submerged in a meter\nof water for up to 30 minutes and still come out swinging. The silicone ear\ncaps and ear fins that ship with with make them crazy comfortable to wear and\nallow for a measure of situational awareness. Alternatively, you can use a set\nof included Comply foam ear tips with the X4s for some serious passive noise\ncancellation.\n\nThe Jaybird X4s make most types of music sound great. Thanks to Jaybird\u2019s free\nMySound iOS app, users can tune the sound of the earphones to suit their\nparticular tastes. The only knock against them is that the X4s use a\nproprietary charging cable to connect to its waterproof pogo port\u2014but that\u2019s a\nsmall issue for a largely outstanding set of earphones.\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * Sounds great under most circumtances\n  * IPX7: can be submerged in one meter of water for 30 minutes\n  * Ship with Comply foam ear tips\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * Proprietary charging cable required\n  * Audio becomes muddy at maximum volume\n  * Audio call quality could be better\n\n### [Aukey EP-B40 Latitude Wireless\nHeadphones](https://www.macworld.com/article/3322514/aukey-ep-b40-latitude-\nwireless-earbuds-review.html)\n\n[](https://www.macworld.com/article/3322514/aukey-ep-b40-latitude-wireless-\nearbuds-review.html)\n\n###### Budget option + workouts\n\n[](https://www.macworld.com/article/3322514/aukey-ep-b40-latitude-wireless-\nearbuds-review.html)\n\n[Read Macworld's review](https://www.macworld.com/article/3322514/aukey-\nep-b40-latitude-wireless-earbuds-review.html)\n\n[$29.99](http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14156&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAUKEY-\nLatitude-Headphones-Sweat-Resistant-\nBluetooth%2Fdp%2FB06ZZSQQTD%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1543262275%26sr%3D8-1%26keywords%3DEP-B40%26ascsubtag%3DUS-002-3241464-003-1442079-web-20)MSRP\n$29.99\n\n[See\nit](http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14156&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAUKEY-\nLatitude-Headphones-Sweat-Resistant-\nBluetooth%2Fdp%2FB06ZZSQQTD%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1543262275%26sr%3D8-1%26keywords%3DEP-B40%26ascsubtag%3DUS-002-3241464-003-1442079-web-20)\n\n[on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/AUKEY-Latitude-Headphones-Sweat-Resistant-\nBluetooth/dp/B06ZZSQQTD/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1543262275&sr=8-1&keywords=EP-B40)\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a set of inexpensive earphones that won\u2019t leave you\nembarrassed or frustrated, Aukey\u2019s EP-B40 Latitude wireless earbuds are your\nhuckleberry. Available for under $30, these surprisingly solid earbuds boast\nsound quality that bests headsets three times their price. Their subtle,\nmature styling belies their low price and, provided your audio source supports\nit, they\u2019ll let you listen to your music using Qualcomm\u2019s aptX technology. For\nthe price, the EP-B40s\u2019 audio performance can\u2019t be matched.\n\nJust keep in mind that these low-cost earbuds only provide between six and\nseven hours of use between charges. Additionally, we experienced a few minor\nconnectivity problems during testing. As the EP-B40s only cost $28, though,\nthese are easy issues to forgive.\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * Surprisingly good sound for the price\n  * Sweat and splash resistant\n  * AptX compatible for supported devices\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * Poor passive noise cancellation\n  * Extra EQ settings don\u2019t do much for their sound\n  * Bluetooth can be unstable when connected to more than one device simultaneously\n\n### [Shure SE535-V+BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating\nEarphones](https://www.macworld.com/article/3322511/shure-\nse535-vbt1-bluetooth-earphones-review.html)\n\n[](https://www.macworld.com/article/3322511/shure-se535-vbt1-bluetooth-\nearphones-review.html)\n\n###### For audiophiles\n\n[](https://www.macworld.com/article/3322511/shure-se535-vbt1-bluetooth-\nearphones-review.html)\n\n[Read Macworld's review](https://www.macworld.com/article/3322511/shure-\nse535-vbt1-bluetooth-earphones-review.html)\n\n[$399.00](http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14156&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FShure-\nSE535-V-BT1-Isolating-\nCommunication%2Fdp%2FB07C7HNH88%2Fref%3Dsr_1_fkmr0_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1543257238%26sr%3D8-1-fkmr0%26keywords%3DShure%2BSE535%2BBT1%26ascsubtag%3DUS-002-3241464-003-1442078-web-20)MSRP\n$499.00\n\n[See\nit](http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14156&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FShure-\nSE535-V-BT1-Isolating-\nCommunication%2Fdp%2FB07C7HNH88%2Fref%3Dsr_1_fkmr0_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1543257238%26sr%3D8-1-fkmr0%26keywords%3DShure%2BSE535%2BBT1%26ascsubtag%3DUS-002-3241464-003-1442078-web-20)\n\n[on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SE535-V-BT1-Isolating-\nCommunication/dp/B07C7HNH88/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1543257238&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=Shure+SE535+BT1)\n\nAt $399, Shure\u2019s SE535+BT1 buds are far more expensive than most people are\nwilling to pay for earphones, Bluetooth or otherwise. But they sound\nexceptional, offering full bass, a wide soundstage, and aural separation that\nmakes listening to complex, layered music a joy.\n\nThese buds also ship with a wide variety of foam and silicone ear caps that\nprovide a comfortable fit and a high level of passive noise cancellation. In\ncontrast to most earphones, the earbuds can be popped off of the cable they\u2019re\nattached to, making it easy to extend their life.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a lot of unkind things to say about these earphones: At moderate\nvolumes, they\u2019ll only provide between six to seven hours of playback. As the\namount of fidelity they offer is so high, you\u2019ll be able to hear the flaws in\nsubpar audio of the likes you\u2019ll find embedded in YouTube videos or while\nstreaming from SoundCloud. Additionally, they\u2019re a little more difficult to\nput on than most earphones you\u2019ll run into.

There\u2019s not too much bass,\nnor too much treble. You get just the right amount of everything.\n\nYou can also adjust the level of active noise cancelling: Using the companion\napp, you can turn it off completely or crank it up to 100 percent to enjoy a\nmeasure of peace and quiet.\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * Active noise-cancellation\n  * High-quality audio\n  * Decent battery\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * Cannot be used without battery power\n  * Pricey\n\n### What to look for\n\n#### Sound\n\nSounding good is a set of earbuds\u2019 raison d\u2019\u00eatre. When you invest in a new\npair of wireless earbuds, it\u2019s fair to assume that they should make everything\nsound its best.\n\nWe start each sound test by listening to a playlist of five songs that spans\ndifferent genres and features strong, layered performances: \u201cFeel Right\u201d by\nMark Ronson, featuring Mystikal; \u201cUp & Rise\u201d by Hazmat Modine; \u201cShake Your\nHips\u201d by The Legendary Shack Shakers; \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 Loin\u201d by Yann Tiersen; and \u201cI\u2019m a\nLittle Mixed\u201d up by Diana Krall.\n\nWe play this set of songs for an hour, paying attention to low, mid, and high-\nfrequency performance, and whether they provide a broad, rich soundstage. We\nalso listen for any sign of distortion at low or high volumes.\n\nAfterward, we use the earbuds in our daily lives for a minimum of three hours\na day over the course of a week, making sure to take in at least one TV show\nor movie. (This allows us to verify that the audio keeps in sync with the\nvideo we see.) Finally, we pay attention to incoming and outgoing call\nquality, to make sure that you won\u2019t get annoyed during a chat.\n\n#### Fit\n\nA set of earbuds or earphones may sound amazing, but you\u2019ll never know it if\nthey don\u2019t fit well. Well-fitted earphones provide a good seal which, in turn,\nprovides passive noise cancellation (or the hush that falls when you jam a\npair of earphones or earplugs into your skull). If you\u2019re in a noisy airport,\ntuning out your environment is a plus\u2014but for safety reasons, it\u2019s less than\nideal if you\u2019re out running. We take this into consideration when evaluating\nearbuds designed for workouts.\n\nBecause no two pairs of ears are identical, we note how many different sizes\nof interchangeable ear cups each set of earphones comes with. If they come\nwith a neckband, we determine whether that band is appropriate for a wide\nvariety of body types.\n\n#### Comfort\n\nThey might fit and sound great, but if your new true wireless cans hurt your\nears, you won\u2019t wear them. We wear the earbuds for at least three hours a day\nfor a week and note if a particular set becomes uncomfortable after a few\nhours of use.\n\n#### Connectivity\n\nWireless earbuds use Bluetooth to connect to your audio device, and to each\nother in the case of true wireless. Connectivity issues can affect battery\nlife, range, and sound quality. We evaluate for signal interruptions between\nthe earbuds and their audio source, and also note if audio drops from the left\nor right side during playback.\n\n#### Features\n\nAt minimum, a good pair of true wireless earbuds should be able to accept\ncalls as well as play and pause music. If a pair offers additional features\nbeyond the basics, those functions should work well and be easy to use.\n\n#### Price\n\nIt almost goes without saying that if you pay a premium for earbuds, they\nshould sound spectacular. If a pair of headphones sound great and don\u2019t cost\nmuch?
