Regardless of the\nambient noise level where you\u2019re running, you\u2019re going to experience the full\nsonic range from these headphones and you won\u2019t have to crank them to 11 to do\nso.\n\nThe SoundSport Pulse may be the best wireless headphones for running the\ncompany has made yet. While the earpieces look a bit unwieldy they actually\nhug the inside of your ear in a gentle yet firm fashion that optimizes\nsecurity and sound delivery without ever feeling like an anchor. In fact, if\nyou turn the sound off and just use them to cancel out the environmental noise\nyou may even forget at some point that you have them on.

Whereas most earphones pump the soundwaves straight\ndown the ear canal to the eardrum [AfterShokz\nTrekz](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CSMRXLC/?tag=gearbeacon-20) uses bone\nconduction to completely bypass the eardrum and send sound waves through your\ncranium directly to the inner ear. This leaves the outer ear free to receive\nenvironmental noise so that you can stay more properly alert to your\nsurroundings when running on the path, sidewalk or road.\n\nBeyond practicality and safety, the Trekz from AfterShokz provide outstanding\nsound quality that\u2019s more than a little surprising to those of us without\ndoctorates in audiology. Perhaps the biggest surprise is not that you can hear\nclearly while the Trekz are jacked but that there is virtually no loss in\nquality even at the very low ends of the volume spectrum. At the end of the\nday, AfterShokz are not going to win the award for best running earphones\nbased on sound quality alone.

They\nloop over the top of the ear and rest gently in the ear canal where they\ndeliver clean, crisp audio at all volume settings. Because of their visually\nsolid appearance, you expect the BackBeat FIT is going to be something of a\ndead weight on your neck but they\u2019re actually lighter than about 75% of the\nsports earphones out there.\n\nThe main controls are located on the exterior of the earpieces. Bluetooth\npairing is simple and reliable and when synced to your handset call quality is\nactually quite good. You\u2019ll get on average about 8 hours on a fully charged\nbattery which isn\u2019t bad but isn\u2019t necessarily great.

If a\npair of earphones fails any of the above categories they don\u2019t make our list.\n\n **Reviews** \\- As always we keep our ear to the ground when it comes to what\nothers are saying about a particular set of earphones. But we\u2019re not Rotten\nTomatoes. We don\u2019t pass judgment based solely on what other people say. We\nlike to make up our own minds. So when it comes to external reviews we\u2019ll read\nthem and take note but at the end of the day the product has to impress _us_\nor it doesn\u2019t make our list.\n\n **Brand** \\- There are some fields where the number of decent manufacturers\ncan be counted on one hand. For whatever reason, the earphone industry is not\none of those fields. It seems virtually every significant tech player has\nwaded into the earphone business. As such you\u2019re going to see lots of brand\nnames on this list of best running earphones because there are so many big\nname brands jockeying for a piece of the earphone market pie.\n\n **Price** \\- There isn\u2019t a set of sports earphones out there that\u2019s going to\nbreak anyone\u2019s bank. That said, some are certainly more expensive than others.\nWhile price isn\u2019t necessarily a determining factor for us we do keep our eyes\nopen for significant values when we can find them and we\u2019ll reward them with a\nplace on our list.\n\n## ![best running earphones](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-\nload/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\n##  **Features To Look For In-Running Earphones**\n\n **Comfortable Fit** \\- Saying something is comfortable is almost entirely\nsubjective. Or at the very least, entirely particular to each person. Since\neveryone\u2019s ears are different it\u2019s virtually impossible to proclaim one set of\nearphones to be the most comfortable or the best fitting. This is one area\nwhere reviews are virtually useless because you really need to try different\nones on yourself and see how they feel to you. As such, when we say a\nparticular set of earphones are comfortable or that they fit well we\u2019re\nspeaking of our own experience with the product and you should keep that in\nmind.\n\n **Sound Quality** \\- Sound quality, while still subject to individual\ninterpretation, yields a bit more convincingly to objective assessment. After\nall, if a pair of headphones emits a loud hiss just about everyone is going to\nhear that. Likewise, if the bass is shallow and tinny most people will pick up\non that. When you try on a pair of headphones (and you should always try them\non before buying if possible) cue up one of your favorite songs. One that you\nknow like the back of your hand, and see if the headphones reproduce all those\nluscious details you love so much. You may find they don\u2019t. Or you may find\nthe sound quality is so good that it opens your mind to other aspects of the\nproduction you had been missing.\n\n **Battery Life** \\- It wasn\u2019t that long ago that batteries for running\nearphones would die out after an hour or two. Today, however, advances in\nbattery technology have produced lithium-ion batteries that charge super-fast\nand provide many hours of listening pleasure. If the earphones you have your\neye on only provide an hour or two hours per charge you might want to cast\nyour sights elsewhere.\n\n **Waterproofing** \\- Waterproofing is important not only because most of us\nare going to get caught in the rain from time to time, but also because many\nof us sweat so much while running it might as well be raining. All of the best\nearphones for running are sweatproof and waterproof. Or at the very least\nwater resistant. Keep in mind that even though they\u2019re waterproof you\u2019ll still\nneed to clean them occasionally. Especially if you sweat a lot.\n\n **Design** \\- The other end of the subjective spectrum from comfort is\ndesign. The reason we have so many different types of everything is that\npeople just can\u2019t seem to agree on what\u2019s beautiful, what\u2019s stylish or what\u2019s\nfashionable. When it comes to running earphones though design should not be a\ndetermining factor. Since this is something you\u2019re going to need to wear on\nyour head and that you expect to deliver on its technological promises comfort\nand performance should be more important considerations than design. Not that\nthe way your sports earphones look isn\u2019t important, it\u2019s just not as important\nas how they feel and sound.\n\n## ![best running earphones](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-\nload/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\n##  **Types of Running Earphones:**\n\n **On-Ear Earphones** \\- On-ear earphones for running hook over the top of the\nears. The extent of this hook depends on the design of the earphone. While\nthey typically cover much of the opening of the ear they don\u2019t actually cover\nthe entire ear itself the way over ear earphones do. This lack of blanket\ncoverage allows a certain amount of environmental sound to still be audible,\nwhich is important if you run on the road or on crowded sidewalks. This type\nof earphone also won\u2019t overheat your ears the way full coverage headphones can\nand do. This type of earphone is also light and easy to stow in your pocket or\njust hang around your neck if you want a break from the music while you run.\n\n **Over-ear Earphones** \\- Over-ear earphones for running are just that;\nearphones that sit over the ear and cover it entirely. In the not too distant\npast, this type of earphone was considered inappropriate and impractical to\nwear during outdoor activities like running. But the lightweight, noise\ncanceling headphones from Beats has upset the applecart of conventional\nthinking and we\u2019re seeing more and more runners sporting over-ear headphones.\nIt may be fashionable and the sound may be great but we\u2019d still advise caution\nwhen wearing this type of earphone while running. Unless of course, you\u2019re on\na treadmill or a genuine running track.\n\n## Running Earphones **FAQs**\n\n###  **Q: What are running headphones?**\n\nA: Running headphones are simply audio headphones that have been adapted to\nthe needs of runners and the conditions they encounter while running. But\nthese days they\u2019re more than just lightweight, waterproof versions of standard\nheadphones. They\u2019ve come to include all types of wireless digital technology.\nSome intended to expand your listening possibilities while running and some to\nenhance the quality of your workout by keeping you apprised of your heart\nrate, temperature and more.\n\n###  **Q: Are all running earphones waterproof?**\n\nA: Most are. And certainly, all of the best running headphones are waterproof.\nWhich means they\u2019re also sweatproof which is just as important. The only\nrunning earphones you\u2019re likely to find that aren\u2019t waterproof are those\nyou\u2019ll get at the big box store. Stick to the items on our list and your\nheadphones won\u2019t fail you when the rain starts falling or the sweat starts\npouring.\n\n![best running earphones](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-\nload/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\n###  **Q: How do I clean my earphones?**\n\nA: When the time comes for some earphone spring cleaning these are the steps\nmost often taken.\n\n  *  **Check with the owner\u2019s manual** \\- Always make sure there are not any specific instructions from the manufacturer before you clean your earphones. If there aren\u2019t then proceed as follows:\n  *  **Clean the outside** \\- Use a clean soft cloth. Dip it in clean water and wring it out thoroughly, then wipe down all the exterior components including the headband.\n  *  **Remove any pads and tips** \\- Dirt and dust often hide in the ear cups. So remove the pads and tips and make sure you clean this area thoroughly with your damp cloth. If you encounter any stubborn dirt use a soft bristle toothbrush to loosen it up then wipe it away with the damp cloth.\n  *  **Dry them out** \\- Once you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve thoroughly cleaned the earphones leave them to air dry. If you\u2019re not sure how long to leave them to check them after 10 minutes and see if they\u2019re completely dry. If it appears that they are, let them sit for a few more minutes anyway just to be sure.\n\n###  **Q: What devices are compatible with my earphones?**\n\nA: Most of the best headphones will pair easily with any Bluetooth enabled\ndevice. This connectivity will provide access to an almost unlimited number of\napps, streaming music of every kind, voice-activated assistants like Siri,\nAlexa and Google Now, performance monitors, Internet radio and much more. Many\nearphones, even running earphones, can be paired to different home\nentertainment systems such as Android or Apple TV, Playstation, Xbox One and\nmore with little fuss, so you can watch your favorite movies or programs late\nat night without waking anyone up.\n\n###  **Q: How often should I replace silicone tips?**\n\nA: Exactly how often you should replace the silicone tips on your earphones\nwill depend entirely on how often you wear them and under what conditions. If,\nfor instance, you wear them once a week for a light jog in the park it may be\nseveral years before you need to replace them. If, on the other hand, you run\nlike you\u2019re possessed every day you\u2019ll likely need to replace them every\ncouple of months. Maybe even more often, depending on how often and how well\nyou clean them (if you clean them at all).\n\n###  **Q: What types of music should I listen to while running?**\n\nA: If you want to use the music to propel yourself along the track or the\nsidewalk or the road or the path you\u2019ll want to listen to something with a\ndriving beat. That typically means something that hits 120 to 140 beats per\nminute (BPM). 120 or so BPM just happens to dovetail nicely with the average\nheart rate of a person engaged in moderately strenuous activity so your music\nand your heart will be in sync.\n\n![best running earphones](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-\nload/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\n###  **Q: Which Sports Earphones are better for running, on-ear earphones or\nover ear earphones?**\n\nA: While it comes down once again to personal taste you want to keep in mind\nthat if you wear noise canceling over-ear headphones for running you\u2019re\nputting yourself at a disadvantage on the street or on busy sidewalks. While\nmusic can be an invaluable accompaniment to running canceling out all\nenvironmental noise may mean you don\u2019t hear that car that\u2019s bearing down on\nyou or that bicyclist who tries to warn you as you drift into his or her\ntravel lane. Many of the best running earphones will allow enough\nenvironmental noise through that safety is not compromised.\n\n![Ben Coleman](//www.gearhungry.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-\nload/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\nBen Coleman\n\nBen Coleman is our resident sports and fitness product expert who offers a\nwide range of information in this field.
