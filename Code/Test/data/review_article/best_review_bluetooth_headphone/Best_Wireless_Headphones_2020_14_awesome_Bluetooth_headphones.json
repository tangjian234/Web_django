You don\u2019t need superhuman\nhearing to tell what\u2019s good, but you do need to know what to listen out for.\n\nOur headphone tests are done by some of the best and most prolific reviewers\nin the industry, with years of experience listening to everything from the\nplasticky freebie earbuds that come with your smartphone, to five-figure\nbeasts of glass and marble. We love music and we want your tunes to sound\ngood, too.\n\nSo we listen every pair of headphones we can get on or in our ears. We use a\nvariety of sources, from basic MP3s playing on a laptop to high-quality tracks\non dedicated hi-res audio players.\n\nOur test tracks are wide-ranging to give headphones a thorough challenge.\nThey\u2019re also familiar, so we know every track backwards, and we know which\nbits might trouble the lesser performers.\n\nWe listen again and again, and we do that for weeks in case the sound changes\n\u2013 because it usually does. Then we\u2019ll listen to similarly priced rivals and\ncome up with a verdict that reflects the performance and features for the\nmoney.\n\n**Still looking for a headphone to buy?** If you\u2019re interested in delving\ndeeper into other types, here are other pages that go into greater detail.\n\n  * [Best wireless headphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-3450127)\n  * [Best wireless earbuds](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/true-wireless-earbuds-3442893)\n  * [Best noise-cancelling headphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/noise-cancelling-headphones-3440212)\n  * [Best running headphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-running-headphones-3433590)\n  * [Best cheap true wireless earbuds](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-cheap-true-wireless-earbuds-4019734)\n\n![Kob\nMonney](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/37-150x150.jpg)\n\n[ Kob Monney ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/author/kobmonney)\n\n  * [ Contact via Twitter ](https://twitter.com/Kob_Monney)\n\nTV & Audio Editor\n\nKob began his career at What Hi-Fi?, starting in the dusty stockroom before\nrising up the ranks to join the editorial and production team as the Buyer\u2019s\nGuide editor.
