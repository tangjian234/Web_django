They have\nan IPX7 rating, meaning they\u2019re fully waterproof and sweatproof. Their\nlightweight design makes them feel like they\u2019re not even in your ears, and the\ncarrying case is slimmer than that of the competition. They are compatible\nwith a companion app that allows you to change the EQ settings or borrow the\nEQ settings that have been used by some of Jaybird\u2019s sponsored athletes.\n\n[Buy Now: $180](https://www.amazon.com/Jaybird-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-\nEarbuds/dp/B07R9QJS9L/?tag=geapat-20)\n\n### Runner Up: Beats Powerbeats Pro\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-\nEarphones/dp/B07R5QD598?tag=geapat-20)\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-\nEarphones/dp/B07R5QD598?tag=geapat-20)\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-\nEarphones/dp/B07R5QD598?tag=geapat-20)\n\n**Water-Resistance:** IPX4  \n **Charging Port:** Lightning  \n **Battery Life:** Up to 9 hours per earbud, 24 total hours with charging case  \n\nThe Powerbeats Pro are similar to the AirPods Pro because they\u2019re both made by\nApple and have the same H1 chip that makes it easy to pair with an iPhone.\nRunners, in particular, will appreciate the large ear hooks that grip and hold\nthe earbuds in place. The nine-hour battery life \u2014 with up to 20 extra hours\nfrom the carrying case \u2014 is unmatched, though said carrying case is _huge_ ,\nmaking these less than ideal for everyday wear. They\u2019re also more expensive\nthan the competition.\n\n[Buy Now: ~~$230~~ $200 (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-\nTotally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B07R5QD598?tag=geapat-20)\n\n[Buy Now: ~~$230~~ $200\n(Apple)](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=31959X896062&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMV6Y2LL%2FA%2Fpowerbeats-\npro-totally-wireless-earphones-\nblack&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gearpatrol.com%2Ftech%2Fa242559%2Fbest-\nheadphones-for-\nrunning%2F%3Fpre%3Dtech%252F%26prefix%3Da%26id%3D242559%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fbest-\nheadphones-for-running)\n\n### Best Budget: Anker Soundcore Spirit X\n\n[](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-Soundcore-SweatGuard-\nTechnology/dp/B07B9R67WR/?tag=geapat-20)\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-Soundcore-SweatGuard-\nTechnology/dp/B07B9R67WR/?tag=geapat-20)\n\n[ ](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-Soundcore-SweatGuard-\nTechnology/dp/B07B9R67WR/?tag=geapat-20)\n\n**Water Resistance:** IPX7  \n **Charging Port:** Micro-USB  \n **Battery Life:** Up to 12 hours  \n\nAnker\u2019s Soundcore Spirit Xs are a great pair of no-frills neckbuds. They are\nextremely sweat- and water-resistant and have an ear hook design, similar to\nthe Powerbeats3 Wireless, so they\u2019ll fit most people\u2019s ears. And for around\n$40, the sound quality is actually pretty good.\n\n[Buy Now: ~~$40~~ $36](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-Soundcore-\nSweatGuard-Technology/dp/B07B9R67WR/?tag=geapat-20)\n\n## Why You Need Sports Headphones\n\nNot all headphones work for running or\n[exercising](https://gearpatrol.com/2016/03/09/7-minute-workout-wahoo-\nfitness/), even if they are wireless. If you have a pair that isn\u2019t\nsweatproof, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll die on you. And if they don\u2019t fit\nyour ears, well, they\u2019re probably not going to stay in, either.\n\nSport headphones add a new dimension to your workout. They\u2019re light,\ncomfortable and designed to stay securely in your ears during high-intensity\nintervals. So if you often find yourself lifting weights, [running on the\nroads or trails](https://gearpatrol.com/2013/10/03/complete-guide-running-\nfirst-marathon/), or doing a [total body\nworkout](https://gearpatrol.com/2015/05/18/three-fast-workouts/), it\u2019s time to\nswap out your basic buds for a pair that goes the extra mile.\n\n## The Rest of the Pack\n\n### Apple AirPods Pro\n\n[](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=31959X896062&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMWP22AM%2FA%2Fairpods-\npro&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gearpatrol.com%2Ftech%2Fa242559%2Fbest-headphones-\nfor-\nrunning%2F%3Fpre%3Dtech%252F%26prefix%3Da%26id%3D242559%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fbest-\nheadphones-for-running)\n\n[\n](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=31959X896062&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMWP22AM%2FA%2Fairpods-\npro&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gearpatrol.com%2Ftech%2Fa242559%2Fbest-headphones-\nfor-\nrunning%2F%3Fpre%3Dtech%252F%26prefix%3Da%26id%3D242559%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fbest-\nheadphones-for-running)\n\n[\n](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=31959X896062&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMWP22AM%2FA%2Fairpods-\npro&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gearpatrol.com%2Ftech%2Fa242559%2Fbest-headphones-\nfor-\nrunning%2F%3Fpre%3Dtech%252F%26prefix%3Da%26id%3D242559%26del%3D%26variantId%3D%26post%3D%252Fbest-\nheadphones-for-running)\n\n**Water-Resistance:** IPX4  \n **Charging Port:** Lightning, wireless charging case  \n **Battery Life:** Up to 5 hours per earbud, 24 total hours with charging case  \n\nThese \u201cpro-level\u201d AirPods are the first wireless earbuds that Apple has ever\nmade that are sweat-resistant, which is great news for runners, as well as\nnoise-canceling, which is great everybody else.
