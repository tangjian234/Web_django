With\nthe advent of newer devices and more sophisticated audio processing and\ntransmission, there are plenty of Bluetooth headphones that will serve you\nwell, without the need for wires.\n\nThere's plenty of variety with these cans, whether you're looking for on-ear\nor over-ear, so browse our selection and see what your next wireless\nheadphones should be. Here's our pick of the best.\n\n  * [If in-ear headphones are more you then check out our other feature](/headphones/buyers-guides/140865-best-in-ear-headphones-top-wireless-and-wired-earbuds-and-earphones-to-buy)\n\n## Best Bluetooth headphones for travel\n\nPocket-lint\n\n### Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700\n\nsquirrel_widget_158195\n\nFollowing the success of the earlier QC35, the newer Bose 700 over-ears really\nstep things up a gear. A seamless design, superb noise-cancelling to cut out\nexternal sound, and loud and proud sound quality without the need for wires (a\nbackup 2.5-3.5mm cable is included in the carry case though). The battery life\nlasts for about 18 hours a go too, making these our go-to over-ear headphones\nfor travelling. There's no better optin.\n\n  * [Read our Bose NC 700 review](/headphones/reviews/bose/148533-bose-smart-nc-headphones-700-review-noise-cancelling)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n### Sony WH-1000XM3\n\nsquirrel_widget_145585\n\nSony has created the other best noise-cancelling over-ear headphones that\nwe've tested. The 1000XM3 are particularly clever with noise-cancelling,\noffering various modes to allow voice to pass through (or not). They can even\nassess pressure to apply the perfect profile when on a plane, making them\nexcellent travel headphones. Bluetooth support for aptX HD means the utmost\nquality without wires, but when the 30 hour battery runs dead you can still\nplug in and listen passively with decent results.\n\n  * [Read our Sony 1000X Mark 3 review](/headphones/reviews/sony/145585-sony-wh-1000xm3-review)\n\n## Best Bluetooth headphones under \u00a3100\n\nPocket-lint\n\n### Urbanista Seattle Wireless\n\nsquirrel_widget_142418\n\nIf you're working on a modest budget then Urbanista has a great value\nproposition in the Seattle Wireless. We can't think of much better Bluetooth-\nequipped cans under the \u00a3100 bar. Sure, you won't get aptX HD or noise-\ncancellation like many of the pricier alternatives below, but the Seattle\nWireless are small, portable, kick out enough bass and are well designed.\n\n  * [Read our Seattle Wireless review](/headphones/reviews/142418-urbanista-seattle-wireless-review-an-affordable-on-ear-ace)\n\n## Best Bluetooth headphones under \u00a3200\n\nPocket-lint\n\n### Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT\n\nsquirrel_widget_148835\n\nPrice-wise, these headphones represent excellent value. They have a lot of\nclout, while there's excellent balance and precision, too. They're also\ncomfortable to wear for long periods and they have excellent battery life.\n\nOur only quibble is that they're physically quite big so are much more suited\nfor a home environment - you'll probably find them a little large for\ntravelling about. The design is, therefore, a little dated. We also miss noise\ncancelling, but then if they had that, they'd be more expensive as a result.\n\n[Read our Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT review](/headphones/reviews/audio-\ntechnica/148161-audio-technica-ath-m50xbt-headphones-review-bluetooth)\n\n## Best Bluetooth headphones for Apple users\n\nPocket-lint\n\n### Beats Solo Pro\n\nsquirrel_widget_168538\n\nYou don't have to have a bevy of Apple devices to make the most from these\ncans, but the Solo Pro's inclusion of the H1 chip means seamless pairing with\nyour iPhone, iPad and Mac, without needing to fiddle around to get that\nwireless connection. The Solo Pro also sound great, so if you're looking for a\npair of on-ear headphones - which arguably aren't as long-term comfy as an\nover-ear solution - then the Beats is a great option.\n\n  * [Read our Beats Solo Pro review](/headphones/reviews/beats/149369-beats-solo-pro-review)\n\n## Best Bluetooth headphones for bass\n\nPocket-lint\n\n### B&O BeoPlay H9i\n\nsquirrel_widget_145722\n\nIt would be too easy to criticise the B&O BeoPlay H9 for the high price and\nthe noise-cancellation being too subtle for some. But that would be\nshortsighted: because the H9i is a killer over-ear headphone. Indeed, the\naudio quality is immense, with punchy bass levels and a wide soundstage thanks\nto those giant earcups. The downside is Bluetooth doesn't last as long as the\ncompetition (but there is a 3.5mm jack for passive wired listening) and the\nnoise-cancelling isn't going to please frequent flyers for its subtlety.\n\n  * [Read our BeoPlay H9i review](/headphones/reviews/145722-beoplay-h9i-review-headphones)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n### Beats Studio 3 Wireless\n\nsquirrel_widget_142148\n\nThe Studio 3 Wireless might not suit the audiophile \u2013 c'mon, everyone knows\nBeats is renowned for bass \u2013 but for everyone else these over-ear cans are\nvery easy to recommend. Especially for Apple users, thanks to the integrated\nW1 chip and its easy pairing which allows for immediate cross-device ease-of-\nuse between iPhone, iPad and Mac. Even if you're not an iPhone user, the\nultra-long battery life, attractive and comfortable design, and serious sound\nquality (and, yep, masses of bass) makes these Beats standout beyond much of\nthe over-ear competition.\n\n  * [Read our Beats Studio 3 Wireless review](/headphones/reviews/beats/142148-beats-studio-3-wireless-review-smart-sounding-ultra-long-lasting-headphones)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n### V-Moda Crossfade 2 Wireless Codex Edition\n\nsquirrel_widget_145881\n\nAs much as we liked the original, the latest 'Codex Edition' Crossfade 2\nWireless adds aptX for high quality Bluetooth and it knocks it out the park\nwhen it comes tyo impactful low-end bass. The industrial design makes them\nstandout compared to the competition, however there's no active noise-\ncancellation and the design is a tad pinchy compared to some.\n\n  * [Read our V-Moda Crossfade Wireless 2 Codex review](/headphones/reviews/145881-v-moda-crossfade-wireless-2-codex-review)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n### Sennheiser Momentum Wireless3\n\nsquirrel_widget_166842\n\nThese noise-cancelling wireless headphones come packed with plenty of smarts\nand high-end features, and look great thanks to being made from high-end\nmaterials. The large size of the earcups means great comfort, but, obviously,\nsignificant physical size.\n\n  * [Read our Sennheiser Momentum Wireless review](/headphones/reviews/sennheiser/149241-sennheiser-momentum-3-review-headphones-over-ear)\n\n## Most unique Bluetooth headphones\n\nPocket-lint\n\n### Nuraphone\n\nsquirrel_widget_144348\n\nOk, so they're not strictly just over-ear, because the Nura combines in-ear\nfittings within the over-ear earcups. It's a unique design, but one with\npurpose: it makes for tailored sound, as these cans can read the shape of your\nears and adjust the sound profile accordingly. They look weird, they feel\nrather strange to wear, but the sound quality is from another planet.\n\n  * [Read our Nuraphones review](/headphones/reviews/144348-nuraphone-headphone-review-price-sound-quality)\n\n## Best Bluetooth headphones for audiophiles\n\nPocket-lint\n\n### Audio-Technica ATH-DSR9BT\n\nsquirrel_widget_139169\n\nTruly high-end Bluetooth-only headphones, the DSR9BT is designed for the\naudiophile listener who doesn't want any wire-based nonsense. Indeed, there's\nno 3.5mm jack to be found here. Ultra-comfortable to wear, these A-T over-ears\nare designed unlike any other headphones on the market, featuring what Audio-\nTechnica calls a Dnote chipset, which commands four voice coils in the\nheadphones' 45mm drivers for optimum dynamics and clarity. And they really do\nsound amazing: you won't get shovel loads of bass, but the low-end is tight\nand neutral, while the high-end has a sharpness and timbre above any beyond\nanything else we've ever heard.\n\n  * [Read our Audio-Technica DSR9BT review](/headphones/reviews/audio-technica/139169-audio-technica-ath-dsr9bt-review-headphones-audiophile-best-digital-bluetooth)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n### Master and Dynamic MW65\n\nsquirrel_widget_148836\n\nYes, it's an expensive pair of headphones but they sound fantastic and have\neffective active noise cancellation (ANC). They also really look the part,\nwith premium materials including aluminium and leather. There's no plastic\nhere.\n\nThe downside is that compared to Sony and Bose's ANC models they are\nexpensive, while some foibles remain such as resonation from walking. However,\nthe build quality on offer here is absolutely superb and we think they're\nbrilliant.\n\n[Read our Master and Dynamic MW65 review](/headphones/reviews/148219-master-\nand-dynamic-mw65-review-headphones-anc)\n\nPocket-lint\n\n### Bowers & Wilkins PX\n\nsquirrel_widget_142432\n\nThe active noise-cancelling wireless headphones market has grown rapidly in\nrecent times, so it made great sense for Bowers & Wilkins to finally enter.\nAnd it does so in considerable style with the PX, which won Best Headphones in\nthe Pocket-lint Gadget Awards 2017. B&W comes from a true audiophile\nperspective \u2013 aptX HD features for Hi-Res Audio without the wires \u2013 and the PX\nis an excellent high-end alternative to the Bose, Sony and Beats competition\n(as also featured), in both style and audio ability terms.\n\n  * [Read our Bowers & Wilkins PX review](/headphones/reviews/bowers-and-wilkins/142432-bowers-and-wilkins-px-review-anc-and-audiophile-talents-combine-in-these-knock-out-over-ears)\n\nSections [Headphones](/headphones)\n\n[Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/shop/pocketlint)\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/pocketlintcom)\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pocketlintcom/)\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pocketlintcom/)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Pocketlint)\n[PodCast](https://shows.pippa.io/pocket-lint-podcast/)\n\nsearch\n\n  * [Pocket-lint Gadget Awards](/awards)\n  * [RSS Feeds](/info/rss)\n  * [Newsletter](/info/newsletter)\n  * [Podcast](https://shows.pippa.io/pocket-lint-podcast/)\n\n  * Popular sections:\n  * [Phones](/phones)\n  * [Apps](/apps)\n  * [TV](/tv)\n  * [Smart home](/smart-home)\n  * [Games](/games)\n  * [Tablets](/tablets)\n  * [Laptops](/laptops)\n  * [Speakers](/speakers)\n  * [Cameras](/cameras)\n  * [Smartwatches](/smartwatches)\n\n  * [Site map](/info/sitemap)\n  * [Contact us](/info/contact-us)\n  * [About Pocket-lint](/info/authors)\n  * [Sustainability](/info/sustainability)\n  * [Editorial Standards](/info/editorial-standards)\n  * [Terms of Use](/info/terms)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/info/policies)\n  * [Advertise on Pocket-lint](/info/advertise-on-pocket-lint)\n  * Privacy Settings\n\n2003 - 2020 \u00a9 Pocket-lint Limited PO Box 4770, Ascot, SL5 5DP.
