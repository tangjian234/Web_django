{"title": "The Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker", "text": "We\u2019ve tested more than 270 portable Bluetooth speakers specifically for this article. Some competitors came very close to our top picks in performance and value, and they may be worth considering, depending on your priorities. Here\u2019s a list of some of the more recent models we\u2019ve considered, in alphabetical order.\n\nThe circular 1More Portable BT Speaker produced distorted bass, made voices sound unnatural, and seemed to vibrate a bit on the table we placed it on.\n\nIn our tests, the Altec Lansing Sonic Boom 2 didn\u2019t play anywhere near as loud as we think a \u201cpool blaster\u201d speaker should.\n\nAlthough we found that the Altec Lansing Super Life Jacket played loud and had impressive bass for its size, we thought the sound was rather rough and uneven.\n\nThe Anker SoundCore has a low price and an appealingly simple design, but it didn\u2019t sound as full and smooth as the Tribit XSound Go.\n\nThe Anker SoundCore Boost loses voice clarity with its bass boost mode activated, but without it, we thought the bass was usually lacking.\n\nWe thought the tiny Anker SoundCore Icon Mini didn\u2019t play loud or clear or full enough to warrant the investment.\n\nThe Anker SoundCore Motion+ plays very loud for its size and cost, but voices have a boosted, unnatural quality, and the bass doesn\u2019t cut it for hip-hop and pop.\n\nOur panelists preferred the Tribit XSound Go to the Anker SoundCore Motion B, but all thought the Motion B sounded pretty good\u2014and it is an excellent value.\n\nThe Anker SoundCore Sport XL plays very loud for its price, but our panelists found its sound to be a little too harsh.\n\nOur panelists thought the Aomais Go had a nice, full sound and a reasonable price, but they thought it was rather bulky for the volume it delivered.\n\nWe liked the clarity of the Audioengine 512 on vocals and most instruments, but thought its bass and lower midrange weren\u2019t strong enough to handle most hip-hop and heavy rock.\n\nThe Aukey SK-M12 SoundTank might be the loudest Bluetooth speaker we\u2019ve heard in the $50 price range, but we thought its sound was too bright and edgy.\n\nOur panelists loved the sound of the B&O Beoplay A1, but they lost their enthusiasm when they saw its high price.\n\nWe like the Bose SoundLink Color II a lot, but we think the Sony SRS-XB32 is more useful and sounds more powerful.\n\nThe Bose SoundLink Micro sounds surprisingly full for its size, but for its price it doesn\u2019t play all that loud.\n\nThe Bose SoundLink Revolve has a big, full sound, but in our tests we thought it distorted too much for something in its price range.\n\nThe Bose SoundLink Revolve+ has an even fuller sound than the Revolve, but our panelists complained about unnatural fluctuations in volume due to its internal limiter settings.\n\nThe Braven 105 doesn\u2019t play very loud, but it sounds fairly clear and full for its size, and its integral elastic strap makes it a good speaker to hang from shower-curtain rods.\n\nThe Braven Balance has a nice, slim design and a reasonable price, but our panelists thought it didn\u2019t play loud enough for its size.\n\nThe Braven BRV-360 has a harsh, overly trebly sound.\n\nThe Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 plays extremely loud for its price and size, but our panelists found its sound rather shrill. The same goes for the OontZ Angle 3 Ultra.\n\nThe Crosley Charlotte CR3028A has an appealing retro style, but it has mediocre Amazon reviews, with complaints about weak sound quality and insufficient volume.\n\nWith a built-in MP3 player and MicroSD card slot, plus a USB input, the Creative Sound Blaster Free is a nice speaker for its price, but we think our top picks sound better.\n\nThe Creative iRoar Go didn\u2019t please our panelists; two complained about a buzzy sound in the midrange and some distortion in the bass.\n\nThe Doss SoundBox Touch is our former pick for best budget Bluetooth speaker, but the Tribit XSound Go delivers comparable sound in a smaller chassis.\n\nThe Doss Traveler is a campsite-friendly speaker with integral LED flashlights. It plays clear and loud, but our panelists liked the Tribit XSound Go better.\n\nThe Doss SoundBox Pro doesn\u2019t really sound better than the Tribit XSound Go, and it\u2019s larger and costlier.\n\nWe found the sound of the Doss SoundBox Plus thin and unpleasant, especially on voices.\n\nThe EarFun Go is similar in size, design, quality, and price to the Tribit XSound Go. Our panelists had a slight preference for the XSound Go, but either is a good buy.\n\nTwo of our panelists praised the EarFun UBOOM for its clear and balanced sound, but two panelists thought its clarity was lacking.\n\nThe Edifier MP200 is a cute, cube-shaped speaker that sounds good but doesn\u2019t play as loud as some competitors, and it scoots around a bit when playing music with a lot of bass.\n\nThe Edifier MP700 sounded impressively clear, but it didn\u2019t play as loud as we\u2019d hoped for its size, and its metal handle made it heavy to lug around.\n\nOur panelists thought the Fender Newport sounded great, but it\u2019s not convenient for portable use. If you like the Newport\u2019s guitar-amp styling, we strongly recommend it.\n\nThe Harman Kardon Onyx Mini has a generally pleasant, fairly full sound, but our panelists thought its sound on bass-heavy music was distorted and indistinct.\n\nWe liked the full, clear sound of the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 4. And even though its rechargeable battery and integral handle make it technically portable, it\u2019s large enough that you probably wouldn\u2019t want to carry it much farther than the backyard.\n\nThe Heyday Square Portable Bluetooth Speaker has almost no bass.\n\nThe iHome iBT374 is nicely priced for the volume and bass it delivers, but our panelists thought the unit\u2019s strong bass and treble overshadowed vocals.\n\nThe Jam Hang Around and Jam Hang Tight are beautifully designed, affordable waterproof speakers with cool integral charging cords, but their sound distorted too often for our taste.\n\nOur panelists thought the JBL Charge 4\u2019s bass sounded too dull and boomy.\n\nThe JBL Clip 3 is a nice, ruggedly designed small speaker, but our panelists didn\u2019t like its near-total lack of bass. And this model\u2019s small integral clip makes it hard to hang off of most objects.\n\nJBL\u2019s Flip Bluetooth speakers are practical, powerful, and reasonably priced. But as with past Flips, our panelists thought the JBL Flip 4 sounded too thin and needed more bass.\n\nThe JBL Flip 5 came very close to being a top pick\u2014it falls between the UE Wonderboom 2 and the Sony SRS-XB32 in price and performance. Our panelists thought it sounded a tad bright but very good overall. However, we got only about six hours of battery life from it.\n\nA cute design and built-in lights make the JBL Jr POP an appealing choice for kids; it sounds clear but has less bass than most other speakers in its price range.\n\nThe JLab Crasher Mini sounded surprisingly full for its size, but our test sample soon started distorting badly.\n\nThe JLab Crasher XL is a good choice if you want something larger and more powerful than the UE Wonderboom 2 for about the same price; our panelists generally liked the Crasher XL\u2019s loud, full sound.\n\nThe Kew Labs K1 tends to sound blaring and garbled when playing hip-hop and heavy rock.\n\nThe Kicker Bullfrog BF400 has a great design for outdoor use, but even though it sounds good at lower volume, it distorted too much for us at high volume.\n\nThe Kicker Bullfrog BF200 is a smaller version of the original Bullfrog. It might have been our top pick in a \u201cpool blaster\u201d had we not found the much more powerful and less expensive (but much bulkier) EcoXGear EcoBoulder+.\n\nThe LG PK7 sounds very clear, clean, and balanced, but despite its large size, it doesn\u2019t play loud enough to fill a bedroom.\n\nWe considered the Libratone One Click as a top pick because it plays pretty loud and has a beautiful design, but it sounds a little too trebly to us.\n\nThe Libratone Too sounds very clear and natural and has a beautiful design, but we don\u2019t think it plays loud enough for the price.\n\nWe liked the full sound and compact design of the House of Marley No Bounds, but deep bass makes it rattle across whatever it\u2019s sitting on.\n\nWe considered making the House of Marley No Bounds Sport a pick because we love the design, and the sound is good for the price, but we got only about six hours of run time.\n\nUnlike almost all other portable Bluetooth speakers, the House of Marley No Bounds XL sounds pretty good cranked up, but at lower volumes the bass seems to obscure vocals and guitars.\n\nThe Marshall Kilburn II tends to clamp down the volume abruptly when it hits a deep bass note, and voices have a sort of canned quality.\n\nI loved the clarity of voices and instruments with the Marshall Stockwell II, but our other panelists thought it should deliver more bass and more volume for the price.\n\nThe Monoprice Deep Blue Sub710 puts out a lot of volume for the price, but our panelists thought it needed a little more bass and a fuller sound.\n\nMy Samsung Galaxy S9 on its own had higher measured output than the Monoprice Deep Blue Sub75.\n\nThe Monoprice Harmony Capsule has good sound quality for its size, but it\u2019s bulkier than the Wonderboom 2, and we got only about 6\u00bd hours of battery life from it.\n\nThe Monoprice Harmony XL delivers powerful sound for the price, and it would make a great office speaker, but its bulk and non-waterproof design make it less practical for portable use.\n\nThe Nyne Bass was a previous pick for its ratio of dollars to decibels, but many newer speakers sound better.\n\nOur panelists thought the Nyne Boost sounded tinny and needed more bass.\n\nThe tiny Polk Boom Bit is one of the most flexible and useful Bluetooth speakers ever. We love it for hiking, but its three-hour battery life limits its utility.\n\nOur panelists thought the Sbode M400 sounded pretty good, but that it didn\u2019t play loud enough.\n\nThe Scosche BoomBottle MM has a nice, very rugged design, but our panelists thought it sounded shrill.\n\nWe like the cool, fold-out design of the Sony GTK-PG10, but we think the EcoXGear EcoBoulder+ sounds better, and it\u2019s more waterproof.\n\nEven with the Extra Bass button engaged, the Sony SRS-XB22 didn\u2019t have enough bass for us, and voices sounded rather coarse.\n\nAlthough the Soundcast VG1 sounds very clean and clear, it doesn\u2019t play particularly loud for its price.\n\nThe Tribit MaxSound Plus is a good-sounding, affordable speaker that falls between the UE Wonderboom 2 and the Tribit XSound Go in price and performance. If we had more picks, this might be one.\n\nWe didn\u2019t like the Tribit StormBox as much as its predecessor, the 360\u00b0 Sound Speaker (which was our former top pick), because we thought its sound seemed brighter and more sibilant than the previous model we tested.\n\nThe Tronsmart Force didn\u2019t put out enough bass for our panelists.\n\nWe think that, for its size, the Tronsmart Element T6 should have more bass; it tends to sound blaring and harsh.\n\nThe UE Boom 3 sounds good, plays loud, and has lots of great features, but our panelists prefer a little more bass for the price.\n\nOur panelists really liked the UE Megaboom 3 for its features and rugged design, but they preferred the fuller sound of the Sony SRS-XB41 and JBL Xtreme 2.\n\nThe Urbanears R\u00e5lis sounded too bassy for our taste, and it didn\u2019t play especially loud for its size.\n\nThe hockey-puck-sized VicTsing SoundHot C6 doesn\u2019t play real loud, but it does sound good. And its detachable suction cup and IPX5 rating make it a good, cheap shower speaker.\n\nThe Vifa City is small and stylish, but it compressed the sound heavily when we played hip-hop and heavy rock tracks.\n\nWe can\u2019t pick the Vifa Oslo because few people want to spend $450 (its price at the time of writing) for a portable speaker. But it plays loud and has a wonderfully full, clear sound.\n\nThe V-Moda Remix is an elegantly designed speaker, but it\u2019s very pricey for the sound quality offered.", "publish_date": "None", "keywords": ["bluetooth", "price", "speaker", "loud", "best", "bass", "good", "design", "thought", "panelists", "sound", "sounds", "portable"], "authors": [], "summary": "The circular 1More Portable BT Speaker produced distorted bass, made voices sound unnatural, and seemed to vibrate a bit on the table we placed it on.\nThe Aukey SK-M12 SoundTank might be the loudest Bluetooth speaker we\u2019ve heard in the $50 price range, but we thought its sound was too bright and edgy.\nThe Doss SoundBox Touch is our former pick for best budget Bluetooth speaker, but the Tribit XSound Go delivers comparable sound in a smaller chassis.\nOur panelists thought the Fender Newport sounded great, but it\u2019s not convenient for portable use.\nThe Heyday Square Portable Bluetooth Speaker has almost no bass."}
