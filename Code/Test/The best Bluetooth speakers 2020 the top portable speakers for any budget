That's why we\u2019ve done the research and picked out the very best portable speakers you can buy in 2020.\n\nThese days many of the best Bluetooth speakers now also come with voice assistants, like Alexa and Google Assistant built-in. This means that some wireless speakers can double up as smart speakers, which you can use to control your smart home devices.\n\nThere are plenty of pair-and-play devices out there too, if the best Bluetooth speaker for you has a simpler setup.\n\nWhatever kind of portable speaker you're looking for, we hope this guide helps you to choose the best Bluetooth speaker for your needs, wants, and budget.\n\nIf you're headed to the beach, pool, or anywhere out in the elements, you might want to check out our guide to the best waterproof speakers of 2020.\n\nOur top picks\n\nThe best Bluetooth speakers you can buy\n\n(Image credit: Sonos)\n\n1. Sonos Move\n\nThe best Bluetooth speaker in the world, Sonos Move brings the party indoors and outside\n\nWeight: 6.61 pounds (3kg) | Battery life: 10 hours | Connectivity: Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n, 2.4 GHz, and 5GHz) and Bluetooth 4.2 | Drivers: One down-firing tweeter, one mid-woofer, two Class-D digital amplifiers | NFC: No | Aux-in: No | USB charging: Yes (USB-C, and comes with charging dock)\n\nIntegrates with a home Sonos speaker network\n\nOn-the-go tunes\n\nNot as feature-rich when using Bluetooth\n\nCant be used as rear cinema speakers\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about the Sonos Move \u2013 it\u2019s so good, you might want to consider it not only as your on-the-go party station, but also as your main in-the-home wireless speaker too.\n\nWith two quality drivers, a solid app that unlocks playback from hundreds of wireless sources, multi-room capabilities and smart audio-tuning tech which tweaks the output based on the speaker's immediate surroundings, the Sonos Move is engineered well beyond your average Bluetooth speaker. It's a versatile speaker, one that stands solidly alongside the built-for-home Sonos speakers that the company made its name on.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect \u2013 it\u2019s heavy as a byproduct of its incredible sound, it\u2019s expensive due to its rich feature set, and it sadly can\u2019t be used as rear channels for a home cinema set-up. But if you\u2019ve got the money, it\u2019s hard to fault the Sonos Move when it comes to hunting down the very best Bluetooth speaker in the world.\n\nRead the full review: Sonos Move review\n\n(Image credit: Ultimate Ears)\n\n2. UE Boom 3\n\nThe former best Bluetooth speaker is still great for travelling with\n\nWeight: 1.2 pounds | Battery life: 15 hours | Wireless range: 30+ feet | Frequency response: 90Hz-20kHz | Drivers: Two 1.75\" drivers and two 1.75\" x 3\" passive radiators | NFC: Yes | Aux-in: No USB charging: Yes\n\nIP67 waterproof/dust-proof\n\nPowerful sound\n\nRugged design\n\nAudio could be clearer\n\nWhile we weren't as impressed with the UE Boom 3 as we were with its predecessor the UE Boom 2, this is still one of the best Bluetooth speakers money can buy in 2020. This is a speaker that can get loud and not distort at higher volumes; be light enough to carry on a camping trip but remain durable enough to tumble in a bag unprotected.\n\nIt's both water and dust-proof, and now has a one-touch mix button that lets you pull up your favorite playlists without ever picking up your phone.\n\nThere are certainly more detailed portable speakers out there, but at a price that's relatively affordable to all, the UE Boom 3 hits all the right notes for the third year in a row.\n\nUltimate Ears now lets you customize your UE Boom 3, so you have even more options when it comes to color and pattern combinations.\n\nRead the full review: UE Boom 3 review\n\n(Image credit: JBL)\n\n3. JBL Flip 5\n\nA fun, no frills portable speaker\n\nWeight: 1.2 pounds | Battery life: 12 hours | Wireless range: N/A | Frequency response: 65Hz - 20kHz | Drivers: 40mm | NFC: No | Bluetooth version: 4.2 | Aux-in: No | USB charging: No\n\nEngaging, entertaining sound\n\nEasy to use\n\nNo 3.5mm input\n\nNo mic for hands-free calls\n\nThe JBL Flip 5 is proof that the best Bluetooth speakers aren't always the ones with the most impressive specs.\n\nJBL\u2019s Flip 5 is a simple soul with Bluetooth-only playback and modest features, but if you desire a rugged, great-sounding portable speaker and can sacrifice voice control or hands-free call functionality, you won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nThanks to its neat design and IPX7 rating it's suitable for use outside as well as in, making it an ideal outdoor speaker, too \u2013 and it's not too pricey at $119.95 / \u00a3119.99 / AU$149.95.\n\nRead the full review: JBL Flip 5 review\n\n[Update: Don't miss our JBL Boombox 2 review \u2013 we were mightily impressed by this portable speaker's IPX7 waterproof rating, long battery life, and distortion-free sound.]\n\n(Image credit: Bose)\n\n4. Bose Home Portable Speaker\n\nA great Sonos Move alternative\n\nWeight: 2.4 pounds | Battery life: 12 hours | Wireless range: N/A | Frequency response: N/A | Drivers: N/A | NFC: No | Bluetooth version: 4.2 | Aux-in: No | USB charging: Yes\n\nGreat design\n\nWell-balanced sound\n\nExpensive\n\nLacking in bass\n\nIf 2019 was the year of the smart speaker, then 2020 is set to be the year of the portable smart speaker \u2013 and with the Bose Portable Home Speaker, along with competing models like the Sonos Move offering the smarts of Google Assistant and Alexa alongside Bluetooth connectivity, the market is already growing fast.\n\nThe Bose Portable Home Speaker isn\u2019t the brand\u2019s first outdoor-friendly speaker, and it shows: gorgeous minimalist design meets weather-ready robustness, with a light build and handle that lends itself to listening on the go.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t quite meet the sonic dexterity of the Sonos Move, or the value for money of the UE Boom 3 and JBL Charge 4 \u2013 but if you love that Bose sound and build quality, this is the speaker for you.\n\nRead the full review: Bose Portable Home Speaker review\n\n(Image credit: Soundcore)\n\n5. Anker Soundcore Flare\n\nThe best budget Bluetooth speaker\n\nWeight: 1.1 pounds | Battery life: 12 hours | Wireless range: 20m / 66ft | Frequency response: N/A | Drivers: 2 x 1.75\" Full Range + 2 x Passive Radiator | NFC: No | Aux-in: Yes | Bluetooth version: 4.2 | Weatherproofing: Yes-IPX7 | Charges devices over USB: No\n\nImpressive sound for the size\n\nExcellent mobile app\n\nWaterproof\n\nHarsh at max volume\n\nAnker has a history of making excellent budget wireless speakers. While we weren\u2019t entirely impressed with the Anker SoundCore 2 \u2019s sound, we couldn\u2019t be too mad since the speaker was so affordable.\n\nSo what happens if you can stretch your budget? For around $20 more you get the Anker Soundcore Flare, an excellent waterproof Bluetooth speaker that can stand toe-to-toe with the competition.\n\nThe Soundcore Flare is an amazing value in the sub-$100 wireless speaker segment. Competitors like the UE Wonderboom (listed above) give the Flare a run for its money in terms of build quality but we give the Flare the slight edge with sound quality. We recommend the Flare for anyone looking for a wireless speaker that can do it all without breaking the bank.\n\nRead the full review: Anker Soundcore Flare review\n\n(Image credit: Ultimate Ears)\n\n6. UE Wonderboom 2\n\nThe best outdoor speaker gets a refresh\n\nWeight: 0.93 pounds | Dimensions: 104 x 95.3mm (H x D) | Battery life: Up to 13 hours | Wireless range: 100 ft (33 m) | Frequency response: 75 Hz \u2013 20 kHz | Drivers: two 40 mm active drivers and two 46.1mm x 65.2mm passive radiators | NFC: No | Bluetooth version: N/A | Aux-in: No | USB charging: No\n\nGreat sound for its size\n\nIP67 dustproof/waterproof rating\n\n30% better battery life\n\nRestrictive soundstage\n\nThe original UE Wonderboom has been at the top of our best waterproof speaker list since its debut and for good reason: it\u2019s rugged, plays louder than its diminutive sound suggests, and could be paired to other UE Wonderboom speakers to amplify sound.\n\nAnd although the UE Wonderboom 2 looks nearly identical to the original, Ultimate Ears packed in a slew of upgrades that make the Wonderboom 2 even better, like the increased battery life (up 30% compared to the original), better bass response, and the new Outdoor Boost feature that helps the speaker get even louder than before.\n\nThe UE Wonderboom 2 is a fantastic rugged and waterproof speaker you\u2019ll actually want to take with. Its small size doesn\u2019t mean small sound, however, as the speaker gets extremely loud and sounds great. While it can\u2019t match the bass response of larger speakers like the UE Boom 3 or the Bose SoundLink Revolve, the improved bass adds warmth and intensity to music that the original was lacking.\n\nAll said, for $100 (\u00a390 AU$129), the UE Wonderboom 2 is still one of the best waterproof speakers you can buy - and our recommended option for those looking to bring their speaker to the beach or pool.\n\nRead the full review: UE Wonderboom 2 review\n\nbose soundlink mini ii (Image credit: Bose)\n\n7. Bose SoundLink Mini II\n\nThe best mid-range speaker\n\nWeight: 1.5 pounds | Dimensions: 2 x 7.1 x 2.3 inches (H x W x D) | Battery life: Up to 10 hours | Wireless range: 30 ft (10 m) | Frequency response: N/A | Drivers: N/A | NFC: No | Bluetooth version: N/A | Aux-in: Yes | USB charging: No\n\nStellar sound\n\nBuilt like a tank\n\nCompact form factor\n\nNot water resistant\n\nThe Bose SoundLink Mini II is relatively ancient, having been released in June 2015. However, writing off the SoundLink Mini II because of its age would be a mistake, as it remains one of the best sounding wireless speakers.\n\nThat said, it punches way above what its size would suggest, producing deep bass, sparkling highs and a lush midrange. While most wireless speakers sound OK, the Mini II proves that small speakers don\u2019t need to compromise on sound, and other Bose conveniences like a charging pad.\n\nRead the full review: Bose SoundLink Mini II review\n\n(Image credit: Sony)\n\n8. Sony SRS-XB501G\n\nThe ultimate party speaker with Google Assistant built right in\n\nWeight: 6 lb 14 oz | Battery life: 12 hours | Wireless range: Approx. 98 ft | Frequency response: 20 - 20,000Hz | Drivers: 45mm | NFC: Yes | Aux-in: N/A | USB charging: No\n\nPortable party speaker\n\nPowerful, spacious sound\n\nLights aren't synchronized\n\nAverage voice detection\n\nThe SRS-XB501G is a big speaker that offers a light show, tripod mount, big sound, and Google Assistant. This is a speaker that you can truly use on the go and in the home after a day of partying. On the go, the speaker is brilliant, playing loudly and for up to 16 hours. But at home, it\u2019s dated design and average voice detection are compromises compared to dedicated home speakers.\n\nCompetitors like the LG PK7 sounds slightly better and has a light show that actually reacts to your music, however it doesn\u2019t have the Google Assistant built in. If you\u2019re looking for an actual portable speaker that you can fit in a bag that also supports Google Assistant, the JBL Link 20 is a good choice. Just don\u2019t expect it to pump out as much bass or offer as wide of a soundstage.\n\nTo that end, the XB501G is a good all-around compromise that fills multiple purposes. It's not the best wireless speaker, nor the best smart speaker, but it's a solid entry in both categories and one of a select few to exist in both camps.\n\nRead the full review: Sony SRS-XB501G review\n\n[Update: Sony\u2019s annual Bluetooth speaker upgrades have rolled out as it with the new Sony SRS-XB23, SRS-XB33 and SRS-XB43 speakers.\n\nThe big changes to the portable speaker lineup include the removal of the strobe LED lights from last year in exchange for less-aggressive pulsing LED strips and new passive radiators on the sides that Sony says will help the speaker sound clearer and punchier in the low-end.]\n\n(Image credit: Bose)\n\n9. Bose SoundLink Revolve\n\nA slightly older Bose winner\n\nWeight: 1.5 pounds | Battery life: Up to 12 hours | Wireless range: 30 feet | Frequency response: N/A | Drivers: N/A | NFC: No | Aux-in: Yes | USB charging: Yes\n\nTrue 360-degree sound\n\nBeautiful design and build\n\nDetailed and expansive sound\n\nBest used indoors\n\nThe Bose SoundLink Revolve is an excellent sound speaker for folks looking for true 360-degree sound. It\u2019s great for sharing music during a party or for moving around the room without losing audio fidelity. However, the Bose SoundLink Mini II sounds slightly better and is slightly cheaper to boot.\n\nOn the debit side, it\u2019s also not fully dust or waterproof so you\u2019ll want to think twice before bringing the Revolve to the beach.\n\nFor half the price, the Wonderboom is a great speaker that is completely dust and waterproof and while it can\u2019t match the audio fidelity or features of the Bose, it's still great for on-the-go listening. If bass is your game, the JBL Charge 4 is an excellent fully waterproof speaker that sounds great, but is big and heavy along with it.\n\nRead the full review: Bose SoundLink Revolve review\n\n(Image credit: Denon)\n\n10. Denon Envaya\n\nThe most durable Bluetooth speaker\n\n: | Weight: : 1.6 pounds | Battery life: : 13 hours | Wireless range: : 30m (100ft) | Frequency response: : N/A | Drivers: : 2 x 40mm Full Range Driver, 1 x 53x135 Passive Radiator | NFC: : No | Aux-in: : Yes | USB charging: : No | Weight: 1.6 pounds | Battery life: 13 hours | Wireless range: 30m (100ft) | Frequency response: N/A | Drivers: 2 x 40mm Full Range Driver, 1 x 53x135 Passive Radiator | NFC: No | Aux-in: Yes | USB charging: No\n\nPowerful, rich, room-filling sound\n\nBetter balanced audio than most\n\nStiff buttons\n\nSlightly larger footprint\n\nThe most recent speaker in the Denon Envaya line was one of the first speakers to absolutely blow us away in 2018 \u2013 and it's still a great purchase two years on. It offers powerful, room-filling sound that will sound great to most ears, plus comes with an IP67 rating, make it both dust and waterproof. It's also built like a tank, making it one of the most durable speakers we've ever laid our hands on.\n\nDespite a nearly flawless performance, the Envaya isn't perfect: While sound quaity is full, powerful and rich, it doesn\u2019t have the treble bite some like and the buttons located along the side can feel stiff and difficult to operate. These are ultimately minor complaints, however, and the Denon Envaya remains a great Bluetooth speaker \u2013 easily among the best you can buy this year.\n\nRead the full review: Denon Envaya (DSB-250BT) review\n\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\n\n11. Urbanista Brisbane\n\nScandi design meets decent sound\n\nWeight: 1.5 pounds | Battery life: 10 hours | Wireless range: 30m (100ft) | Frequency response: 80-20,000Hz | Drivers: 2 x 52mm | NFC: No | Aux-in: No | USB charging: No\n\nGreat audio performance\n\nSecond speaker pairing\n\nCould be more rugged\n\nUnremarkable looking\n\nThe Urbanista Brisbane might not look exciting, but beneath its unassuming package lies a powerful Bluetooth speaker. Loud and rich-sounding, it's a well-priced addition to anyone's home, with a good battery life and the option to pair it with another Brisbane for true stereo sound.\n\nFor the price, the Urbanista Brisbane is ultimately a bit of a bargain. You'll find better sound quality out there, but it'll cost you a lot more. All in all, this mid-range speaker could be a great choice for anyone who wants the freedom of wireless listening without sacrificing volume levels.\n\nRead the full review: Urbanista Brisbane review\n\n(Image credit: 1MORE)\n\n12. 1MORE Portable BT Speaker\n\nA luxurious Bluetooth speaker for the office and the home\n\nWeight: 268g | Battery life: 12 hours | Wireless range: N/A | Frequency response: N/A | Drivers: N/A | NFC: No | Aux-in: Yes | USB charging: Yes\n\nGreat sound quality for the size\n\nImpressive bass response at low volume\n\nLimited IPX4 rating\n\nAverage battery life\n\nThe 1MORE Portable BT Speaker sounds great for the price. It has an impressive amount of bass at low volumes but drops off at higher volumes.\n\nThis Bluetooth speaker is good for traveling professionals who want better sound quality, a speakerphone, and some water resistance, but those who want a more rugged speaker should look elsewhere \u2013 the IPX4 rating won't really cut it if you're expecting your speaker to get wet.\n\nRead more: 1MORE Portable BT Speaker review\n\nBest Bluetooth speakers at a glance\n\nSonos Move UE Boom 3 JBL Charge 4 Bose Home Portable Speaker Anker Soundcore Flare UE Wonderboom 2 Bose SoundLink Mini II Sony SRS-XB501G Bose Soundlink Revolve Denon Envaya (DSB-250BT) Urbanista Brisbane 1MORE Portable BT Speaker\n\nChoosing your Bluetooth speaker\n\nHow to pick out the best Bluetooth speaker\n\nWhich speaker type is best for you?

Looking for some Hi-Res audiophile speakers to go with your record player? Check out the best stereo speakers. Bored of your TV's lackluster audio? Try one of our best soundbars or Dolby Atmos speakers on for size. If you need a speaker you can take everywhere, make sure you look at the best waterproof speakers. For total control of your smart home, invest in one of the best smart speakers, which come with Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, or Siri built-in.\n\nThere are so many new Bluetooth speakers on the market these days with great designs and the latest tech built-in that it can be tricky to figure out which one you need. Although it may seem like the choice is endless, there are plenty with unique selling points that'll suit you.\n\nFirst up, some portable speakers are built with ultimate durability in mind, others are weather and waterproof for camping and tunes by the pool; however, some aren't fit for the outdoors and would look pretty inside your home instead.\n\nIf you're having trouble figuring out which is the best Bluetooth speaker for you, start by picturing where you're going to use it and find a speaker that matches that setting. That means if you're a beach person, water and dust-proofing in your outdoor speaker are key.\n\nOr, if you're a party person, you might want the ability to connect two speakers together or a speaker with multi-point pairing that allows multiple devices to connect at a time.
