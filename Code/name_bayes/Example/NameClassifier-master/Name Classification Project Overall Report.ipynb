    "With increasing foreginer populations in Japan, there are need to take statistics of numbers of foreginers in any organizations in Japn.\n",
    "In many cases, databases does not include the person's nationality. Automating the task of classification of person into their nationality based on provided name strings and thier address is the objective of this project.\n",

    "Based on the 2 sources below, entire population of Japan at 2018 is 126443000, while foregin residents (who stays longer than 3 months) are 2731093, which is approximately 2.16%.\n",

    "    - very simple implementation, but lack of the training data was a problem, as well as classifying Asian names represented in Kanji characters. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Previous Version\n",
    "\n",
    "One can create a simple name classifier using regex in order to implement the following logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "If name is in Hiragana and/or Commonly Used Kanji:\n",

    "- East Asian name that includes kanji as well, such as Chinese, Tiwanese or Korean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Katakana representation is especially problematic, because foregin resident's names are represented in katakana for official use most of the time, and some Japanese names (using unsusal Kanji or elderly person's) are sometimes represented as Katakana.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue\n",
    "Because both person's name and addresses are part of Personal Identifiable Information (PII), it is extrememly difficult to collect data that accurately represent the real world demographic. <br>\n",

    "## Potential Approaches / Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Regex and Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Using regex to classify each letters into alphabet, Katakana, Hiragana and other language representations. This approach only works when all strings are represented in thier native characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is simple and can handle various kinds of langugage representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Word Level Tokenization**<br>\n",
    "Using this approach, we can provide as many unique first and last names as possible in the dataset to cover the entire population.\n",
    "Problem of this approach is its predicting power is limited to words (names) seen in the training dataset, and cannot handle unseen ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Character Level Tokenization**<br>\n",
    "Advantage of this approach is that I don't have to provide every single unique names, just a components (characters) of it. Another advantage is that it might be able to predict unseen names correctly, as long as it's components are included in the training dataset. (Different name, but using same set of characters in different order). I could use `CountVectorizer` or other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it really tokenized in character level or by ascii or utf-8 encoding? etc? \n",
    "Dig Deeper\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Character Level Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "2 approach here,\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Alphabet Only**<br>\n",
    "In this approach, first all of name / address strings will be converted into alphabet. \n",
    "In Japanese's roman representation, \n",
    "- One Hiragana / Katakana is almost always represented as 2 alphabets\n",
    "- Ordering of Consonant followed by Vowel in pair, and repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure probably is a useful feature. I can possibly use a language representation methods that\n",
    "- retain information of characters' ordering (N-gram, RNN, etc) \n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantage is that romanizing various languages might be very difficult task in itself. (Use Mechanical Turk? and train another model for it? jk).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Native Character**<br>\n",
    "I'm not sure of it's possibility or disadvantages, but it's an idea.\n",
