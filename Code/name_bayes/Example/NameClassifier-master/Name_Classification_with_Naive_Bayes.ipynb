    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus of this project is to build a python module, that can determine if a person is Japanese or not, based on their name string. \n",
    "Final product is a class file containing `NameClassifier` class, capable of \n",
    "- loading & preprocessing train and test data\n",
    "- train the model\n",
    "- predict and evaluate the model\n",
    "- save & load trained model for future use\n",
    "\n",
    "The data of name strings with various origin from the world was obtained by using `Faker` library in python. 100000 fake names were created for each class for training and testing purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries / Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Couple python libraries were used to build this class\n",
    "- scikit-learn\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- pickle\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use the class, these libraries and their dependencies need to be installed on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup and Locations\n",
    "\n",
    "This class is only tested on Ubuntu Linux 18.04 version, and can be used by importing the class. The class file `model.py` needs to be located in the directory where you intend to use it. Data and saved model file can be located anywhere, as long as you have relative path to them from the class file. However generally it's good idea to keep everything within same or its child's directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the basics are all out of the way, let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Taking a look at data\n",
    "\n",
    "This module load in the name data as csv file using pandas. You should have separate csv files, each for Japanese and non-Japanese names. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a file, this would look like\n",
    "\n",
    ">Country, Address, name, other col..<br>\n",
    "value1, value2, John Smith, value4\n",
    "\n",
    "**As long as there is a column named `name` with the name data, other columns can also be present.<br> \n",
    "There should always be a white space between first and last name, since the model breaks down into first and last name, and analyze them.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, using dataframe, the data might look like"
