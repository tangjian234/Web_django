Better yet, lots of Bluetooth speakers are water- and dust resistant, meaning you can jam out by the pool without having to worry about damaging your device.\n\nSee all of our best Bluetooth speaker picks below.\n\nWhat is the best Bluetooth speaker?\n\nWe think the best Bluetooth speaker of all the models we\u2019ve tested is the UE Megaboom 3. It lands in the sweet spot of offering nearly everything you\u2019d want out of a Bluetooth speaker at a reasonable price point. The Megaboom 3 sounds great when playing all genres of music, offers an impressive 20 hours of playback and is sturdy enough to face the elements outdoors.

For $40, the SoundCore 2 delivers loud sound in a durable, compact body.

The Move's Auto TruePlay adjusts the speaker\u2019s output settings to make it sound the best for the space it\u2019s in, whether that\u2019s your patio, deck, backyard or bedroom.\n\nFor a less expensive option of a Bluetooth speaker with smarts, the JBL Link 20 is a reliable choice. The Link 20 sounds as premium as the best Bluetooth speaker and provides a reasonable 10 hours of battery life. It\u2019s waterproof, too, meaning you can bring Google Assistant in the pool with you next time you go for a dip.\n\nRead on for all of our best Bluetooth speaker picks.\n\nThe best Bluetooth speakers right now\n\n(Image credit: UE)\n\n1.

It'll last 8 hours on the road, and it packs a dependable speakerphone for making calls.

And if you\u2019re not bringing it wherever you are, you should be.\n\nRead our full JBL Clip 2 review.\n\nHow to choose the best Bluetooth speaker for you\n\nThere are a couple things you\u2019ll want to consider when shopping for a Bluetooth speaker, the first of which is whether you want it to be wireless or wired. While a number of wired speakers like the Amazon Echo provide excellent Bluetooth listening, you can\u2019t bring them outside your kitchen or living room. Stick to a speaker with a rechargeable battery for on-the-go audio.\n\nWith that, you\u2019ll need to decide if an option with a voice assistant is the best Bluetooth speaker for you. If you plan to use your speaker in your backyard, it could be useful to have Google Assistant\u2019s or Alexa\u2019s powers at your disposal. That way you can change the music using your voice, rather than controlling the audio through your phone. These smart features will not work beyond your home\u2019s Wi-Fi, so opt for a non-smart Bluetooth speaker for the beach or other outdoorsy locales.\n\nHow we test the best Bluetooth speakers\n\nEvery product on this list is considered the best Bluetooth speaker for one or more standout features, however each must meet basic requirements during our testing to be considered. We spend several hours listening to music, making calls and toting around every speaker to make sure it sounds great across all genres, provides solid call quality and withstands minor bumps or splashes.\n\nIf a speaker offers smart features, we enable the supported voice assistant to see how it fares against other top rated smart speakers. We\u2019ll use it to control smart home devices, browse playlists and get answers to other common queries.\n\nWe also test battery life, exhausting each speaker\u2019s battery after a full charge to see how long it can last under realistic conditions. A smart speaker connected to Wi-Fi should last at least 10 hours, while a standard Bluetooth speaker should last around 20. Most people want to know how much play time they can expect when their speaker is brought along for a day trip.", "publish_date": "2020-06-11", "keywords": ["x", "bluetooth", "speaker", "life", "sound", "smart", "best", "speakers", "2020", "hours", "wireless", "battery", "portable"], "authors": ["Michael Andronico"], "summary": "And even if you enjoy most of your music inside, the best Bluetooth speakers make a great addition to any audio setup.\nWe think the best Bluetooth speaker of all the models we\u2019ve tested is the UE Megaboom 3.\nHow to choose the best Bluetooth speaker for youThere are a couple things you\u2019ll want to consider when shopping for a Bluetooth speaker, the first of which is whether you want it to be wireless or wired.\nWith that, you\u2019ll need to decide if an option with a voice assistant is the best Bluetooth speaker for you.\nHow we test the best Bluetooth speakersEvery product on this list is considered the best Bluetooth speaker for one or more standout features, however each must meet basic requirements during our testing to be considered."}
