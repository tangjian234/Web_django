##### Introduction

<Web crawler And new data summary >

- This project is intended to be a walkthrough on the development of _a machine learning project from end to end._

- -It covers the **creation a real-time** web application _that_ gathers data from several newspapers and shows a summary of the **different topics that are being treated in the news articles**.

#####

#####

1. - Problem definition and solution approach
2. - Input data
3. - Creation of the **initial dataset**
4. - Exploratory Data Analysis
5. - Feature Engineering
6. - Predictive Models
