## Question :

## About

### One liner

    - 35 USD
    - System on broad
    - Linux computer
    - Many system ports
    - Many Hardware applications

### Detail

The Raspberry Pi is a **low cost**, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.

It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python

### As a hobby , Raspberry Pi

    - be a simple web server to demonstration of key NLP services.
      - Name identification.
      - Amazon
    - always online and provide my service.
    - Other hobby.

#### Reading 2 : Setup a Raspberry Pi Web Server

- [Setup a Raspberry Pi Web Server with Your Own .COM Using **Google Domains**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzojwG7OB7c&t=744s)

In this video I show how to setup a Raspberry Pi web server and how to connect it to your own domain name (.com, .org, etc.).

We start be installing **Raspbian**, then install software updates, and then install Apache, PHP and MySQL. After verifying that the web server is functioning properly, I show how to sign up for a domain name with **Google Domains**, and how to use their **Dynamic** DNS service so your domain will work with typical residential internet service providers.

We also install TeraTerm and Swish SFTP on the Windows PC in order to interact with the Raspberry Pi over the network.
