  Streamlit is announced as being The fastest way to build custom Machine Learning tools but I believe it has the potential to become much more awesome than that.

I believe Streamlit has the potential to become the Iphone of Data Science Apps. And maybe it can even become the Iphone of Technical Writing, Code, Micro Apps and Python.
